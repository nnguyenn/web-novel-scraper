  The three of them looked at us as if we were crazy.
 </p>
 <p>
  The number of equipment displayed in the armory had significantly decreased. There were only two items left: a bow and a shield. In Pick Me Up, when a hero dies, the equipment they’re carrying disappears.

 <p>
  Jenna took out a bow and quiver and strapped them to her back. And I secured the leather strap on the back of the wooden shield to my wrist.
 </p>
 <p>
  As we equipped ourselves and stepped out of the armory, the door closed immediately.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle appeared and scolded us.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Han, Jenna, Aaron, Toby, Yellens! Get here immediately!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is this thing?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you want from us?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where did you come from? Send us back!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The men expressed hostility towards Iselle.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna intervened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stop it. You don’t want to see what happens if you mess with her.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you part of the gang too? Did you bring us here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m not part of the “gang.” A few days ago, I was brought here just like you. That’s why I adapted first.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why bother with this annoying stuff? They will find out on their own in a few minutes anyway.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After saying that, I walked into the rift of space and time.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how much Jenna and I will explain, they won’t understand. Even if they do, they won’t accept it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh, really.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna, who seemed frustrated, let out a sigh and followed me. A grumbling voice could be heard from behind.
 </p>
 <p>
  “My wife is waiting! Send me back quickly!”

 <p>
  “I’m a poor farmer with not a single coin. You’ve found the wrong person!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I wondered how long Iselle could endure.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna asked me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are they going to die?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “As long as they try to touch her.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A while later, one of the men flew towards us like a projectile. He fell to the ground and groaned in pain.
 </p>
 <p>
  The remaining two also flew towards us. Finally, when Iselle entered, the door leading to the square closed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “From now on, if you don’t want to be thrown like a bag of trash, listen carefully to what I say, just like those guys.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The leftmost mirror began to shine.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the mirror of the main dungeon. The master will probably send us again to the second floor. We can go back to the first floor, but there’s no benefit at this point.

 <p>
  As the light gradually filled the room, other party members pounded on the exit, thinking they were going to die. Some even attacked Iselle.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Tsk, how troublesome!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle lightly soared upwards, avoiding their attacks.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then, the room was filled with light.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Floor 2.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mission Type – Subjugation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Objective – Annihilate the enemies!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Field Type, Plain.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Similar to a meadow but subtly different. The grass was sparse, and the ground was sloping.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wolves, huh?”
 </p>

  Two wolves with gray fur growled on the higher slope. Above them, goblins with slings were picking up rocks.
 </p>
 <p>
  I furrowed my brows. Both the terrain and the composition favored the enemies. We were below, and they were above. If it were just the wolves, it wouldn’t be a problem, but there were long-range goblins as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wha-what’s that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huff.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Aaron(★)’ feels fear. All attributes decreased by 30%.]

 <p>

  I took a deep breath.

 <p>
  Have ordinary humans ever encountered wild beasts like this?
 </p>
 <p>
  The wolves displayed their hostility without reservation. I caught a glimpse of their sharp fangs, ready to bite and tear apart the soft flesh of a human.
 </p>
 <p>
  I steadied my trembling heart. They might look strong, but they’re nothing special. I’ve had fighting experience, and I’ve become strong enough.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Growl…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Jenna(★)’ feels fear. All attributes decreased by 30%.]
 </p>
 <p>
  No. You shouldn’t be like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  I tapped Jenna’s shoulder. She was trembling, it seems she didn’t see me reaching out for her, and she suddenly let out a scream.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aaaah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Did she just scream?
 </p>
 <p>
  Sigh-

  “What’s wrong? Did you eat something bad?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You scared me!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna pouted her mouth at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  But in the next moment, Jenna regained her composure.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Jenna(★)’ is no longer afraid.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s okay. I just… just need a moment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You take care of those two goblins. As long as I don’t have to worry about rocks coming my way, I can handle the wolves myself.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  A goblin threw a rock. It wasn’t aimed at me. It was aimed at Jenna, who was rummaging through the quiver. I ran forward and deflected the rock with my shield.

  “This will be the last time!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes!”
 </p>
 <p>
  When I glanced behind me, the other three were huddled together, trembling.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They’re truly useless.”
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, it seemed like they couldn’t even serve as decoys. The enemies were clearly targeting me and Jenna.
 </p>
 <p>
  I bit my lip hard. I won’t end up like those guys. I’ll fight until the end.
 </p>
 <p>
  And survive.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Grrraah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A wolf leaped with its jaws open. It was a quadrupedal creature. Different from the human form, it had exceptional agility. But I anticipated this pattern.
 </p>
 <p>
  I thrust the old iron sword into the wolf’s mouth.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Aren’t you dead yet?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The wolf writhed in pain but didn’t die from a single blow.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if it pierced through the roof of its mouth, it didn’t seem to reach its brain. I tried to pull out the sword, but it got stuck somewhere in the bones. On the hilltop, another wolf paced back and forth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is it because the weapon is worn-out?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Before I could think further, the other wolf leaped forward. I pressed my body against the ground and rolled to the side. The terrain was sloped. The wolf’s leap missed and hit the empty air.
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as I stood up, I rushed forward and kicked the wolf with the sword stuck in its mouth, then drew the sword with all of my might from its mouth and struck it in its forehead.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘One.’
 </p>
 <p>
  “Crunch! Crack!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The wolf howled down the hill.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our positions were reversed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The wolf ran at me in a straight line. There was no need to back down, I also rushed forward with my shield.
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as we met, I slapped the shield against the cheek of the wolf, then thrust the iron sword into its side.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kaeng! Gaegaeng!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The wolf that had been writhing on the ground momentarily went limp.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Two down.”
 </p>
 <p>
  What about the goblins?
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked up the hill. Two goblins, turned into hedgehogs by arrows, lay sprawled on the ground. With a squelching sound, another arrow pierced one of the goblin’s corpses.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s enough! They’re dead.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Y-Yes!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”

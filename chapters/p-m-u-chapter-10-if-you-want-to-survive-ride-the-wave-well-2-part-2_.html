  We returned through the rift of space and time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna touched the vanished wound on her forehead with a fascinated expression, while the other three were still in a daze.

  [Congratulations on clearing the 2nd floor!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Moving on to the 3rd floor.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Thump, thump, thump.
 </p>
 <p>
  The waiting room vibrated.
 </p>
 <p>
  “W-what… what just happened?”
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the men mumbled in a bewildered voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle didn’t appear. Did she get too fed up? I decided not to care either.

  “Good.”
 </p>
 <p>
  My Intelligence decreased by 1, but my Strength increased by 2. The overall growth rate remained at 4, but the efficiency of leveling up had improved. It was evident that my constitution was getting better.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, do you want to end the session?]

 <p>
  One floor per day.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Master also didn’t rush through the progress. If we had simply pushed through like on the 1st floor, both Jenna and I would have been in danger. Although there were no visible injuries, fatigue lingered.
 </p>
 <p>
  I entered the armory, hung up the shield, and then came outside.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna and the other three were arguing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why were you just watching from behind? We were the only ones fighting!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You should’ve let us know about the situation! What’s what!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I explained it from the beginning! Just fight!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why should I fight? Where the hell is this place? What are those monsters, and how did they drag us here with some kind of magic?”
 </p>

 <p>
  “That’s not important right now. To survive, we have to fight first. We can think later.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve never even held a sword. How am I supposed to fight monsters?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who here has ever fought before?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The argument grew more heated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna argued that we were also summoned before to fight like we just did and that we had to work together and combine our strengths to survive. However, the other three were indifferent. They stubbornly refused, saying that they won’t do it.
 </p>
 <p>
  They couldn’t accept reality.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now I understood why 1-star heroes were referred to as trash.
 </p>
 <p>
  1-star heroes were ordinary people. They had lived lives unrelated to the battlefield. Just recalling their self-introductions during the 10-summoning, none of them had a profession related to combat.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was one exception, the 2-star, Molmont.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was called a mercenary.

 <p>
  “If that’s the case, it means that as the stars increase, combat-related professions are summoned.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, advanced heroes didn’t hesitate.
 </p>
 <p>
  When you put newly summoned 1-star heroes into battle, they would easily succumb to fear or panic. But it was different for 3-stars and above. They would immediately engage in combat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do they come here knowing all of this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The reason to fight and even the objective.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shay must have known. It was evident from her attitude.
 </p>
 <p>
  If I had been a bit more composed, I could have asked her.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is frustrating!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna went into the armory with determination and returned after returning her bow.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wouldn’t it be better if you helped explain this too, hyung? We’re in this fight together, so we should support and console each other to become comrades.”

  “Why should I bother with useless guys like them?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s better than having nothing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They won’t be here soon anyway.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you mean?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait and see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Fighting doesn’t always mean dying.
 </p>
 <p>
  If they remain in that state until the next battle, they will disappear.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the closed door of the synthesis workshop.
 </p>
 <p>
  “In the next battle, you and I will just keep fighting together. Don’t worry about them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna grumbled but nodded her head.

 <p>
  “My room?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m curious about what it looks like. Why, don’t you want to?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, that’s fine.”
 </p>
 <p>
  We passed through the center of the square and headed towards the lodging. Along the way, a man who was muttering to himself in a corner of the square approached us.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, there’s something I want to ask you!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t ask. It’s annoying.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What did you say?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The man tried to grab me by the collar.
 </p>
 <p>
  I swung my fist and struck his face.

 <p>
  “Ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The man staggered grotesquely.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are the guys who hid in a corner while we shed blood supposed to have that kind of attitude?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, no! I…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I spat on the ground and moved on. The man was clutching his bleeding nose, whimpering.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Heh heh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s so funny?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nothing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna said then opened the door to the lodging.
 </p>
 <p>
  The interior of the room, made of woven wood, was revealed. Furniture such as a dining table, chairs, and a display cabinet lined the room, and stones that emitted light were embedded in the walls.

  It didn’t give off the air of modern civilization, and it didn’t have things like a refrigerator or gas stove.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Lodging Lv.1]
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a lodging.
 </p>
 <p>
  Strictly speaking, this place was more of a lodging for heroes rather than Jenna’s house. In other words, those three pathetic individuals would also be staying here.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But why is my room different?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t figure it out right now.
 </p>
 <p>
  I decided to think about it later.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you want to eat? We only have potatoes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Only potatoes?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Potatoes with salt and water, perhaps? It’s not much, but it will be replenished by tomorrow. That’s all we have.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In my room, I only have instant noodles and orange juice.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps it’s because the lodging level is low.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna took out a few potatoes from the display cabinet, pierced them with a skewer, and put them in the hearth in the middle of the room.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the potatoes were cooking, I explored the lodging.
 </p>
 <p>
  A long corridor stretched inward, with rooms arranged along it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Currently, there weren’t many rooms, and the facilities were mediocre, but as the lodging level increased, it would gradually become larger and more spacious.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the beginning of the game, you can have up to 20 heroes. You need to upgrade the lodging to summon more heroes. That’s how the system in Pick Me Up is implemented here.
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t expect it at first, but the potatoes were delicious.

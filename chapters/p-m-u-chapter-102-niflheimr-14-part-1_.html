 <p>
  The control window changed, transitioning to the puzzle screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  But it wasn’t your typical polyhedron puzzle that you commonly see in manual creations. On the screen, numerous types of games were listed; ones to be used in this creation. I skimmed through them.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Starting with the most basic ones.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A crossword puzzle that matches horizontally and vertically.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Pinball, Tetris, Find the Wrong Picture, Nonograms, Crossword, and even a Rhythm Game.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Furthermore, various other puzzles were displayed in small squares.
 </p>
 <p>
  Altogether, there were 13 types. Flames added a fiery effect to the start screen of the puzzle.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Are you ready to handle hell?]
 </p>
 <p>
  I loosened the joints of my fingers.
 </p>
 <p>
  The preparation was already done.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yurnet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Yes, I am ready.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  White bookshelves fluttered around Yurnet.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ring!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Puzzle Start!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [1. Cube Puzzle (Super God-like + Penalty)]
 </p>
 <p>
  [27 X 27]
 </p>
 <p>
  With 16-bit background music, the puzzle screen appeared.
 </p>

 <p>
  On the screen, a sword that I was going to create was displayed in dots.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shoosh shoosh shoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  The graphic of the sword began to rotate at an incredible speed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Left left up down left left right right right up left up down down right left left.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I quickly analyzed the pattern of the puzzle.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Left three times, right twice, up five times, down four times.’
 </p>
 <p>
  While looking at the pattern, I started calculating.
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s no time to analyze leisurely. The penalty was about to be applied.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Penalty Activated!]

 <p>
  The game screen distorted as if it was splashed with ink.
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t see anything. In that state,
 </p>
 <p>
  [00 : 30 : 00]
 </p>
 <p>
  30 seconds on the time limit. The timer started ticking.
 </p>
 <p>
  I dragged the outside of the game window.
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t see the map. But the calculations were already done.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Left three, right two, up five, down four, left two, right two, up two, down eight.’

  The timer began to double its speed.
 </p>
 <p>
  In no time, there were only 10 seconds left. The screen still showed nothing.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Even so.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I could do this without seeing.
 </p>
 <p>
  I moved my fingers frantically.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Puzzle Clear!]

  The lava lake erupted violently with bright flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Great!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The hellish flames of hell are about to dwell in the Primordial Forge!]
 </p>
 <p>
  A huge magic circle was drawn on the surface of the lake.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Interference power transmission completed. Production facility, start processing.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Understood!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang! Clang! Clang!
 </p>
 <p>
  The sound of a hammer striking an anvil.
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t look back. The second game was beginning.
 </p>
 <p>

 <p>
  The initial screen of the rhythm game was appearing.
 </p>
 <p>
  I placed my right hand on the five keys in the rhythm game.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the 16-bit music playing, a message appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Start!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Notes began to fall at a crazy speed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Simultaneously, the penalty was applied again. This time, it was a blindness penalty as well. I couldn’t see the side with the keys at all. 90% of the screen was covered.
 </p>
 <p>
  [128 Combo!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Perfect!]
 </p>
 <p>

 <p>
  ‘There’s nothing you can throw at me that I cannot handle.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As long as I could gauge the falling speed and position, I could time the hits.
 </p>
 <p>
  I hit hundreds of notes per minute perfectly. In the Super God-like level, it had to be perfect; even a minor mistake could greatly reduce the weapon’s quality.
 </p>
 <p>
  [835 Combo!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Perfect!]
 </p>

  A large flame sprang from the lava lake.

  &lt;It… it works. Has he really returned?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Alloy complete. I’m using it.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  A dark red iron ingot floated above the lake.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dark red steel. An exceptional metal used to create Five Sacred Weapons. Originally, it was made from a combination of nine ores, but this time, two more ingredients were added.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a Plop. The iron ingot sank into the lave, and the surface turned even redder.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your skills have improved significantly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now, let’s begin.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I replied briefly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The next game continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  [3. Tetris (Super God-like + Penalty)]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Use Blocks: 5 types]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Blind]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Acceleration x3]
 </p>
 <p>
  Immediately started. Blocks fell without a moment to catch a breath.
 </p>
 <p>
  Half of the screen was obscured. I adjusted the shape of the blocks and calculated the lower part. I left gaps in a straight line while filling every space with blocks.
 </p>
 <p>
  [1 Combo!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [2 Combo!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [3 Com…….]

 </p>
 <p>
  [Great!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hell’s magic will be bestowed upon the Primordial Forge!]
 </p>
 <p>
  After a flash on the lava, the magic circle turned red.
 </p>
 <p>
  From the large magic circle, dozens of smaller magic circles were created in succession. Yurnet was performing the enchantment work. I kept my focus on the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  [4. Pinball (Super God-like + Penalty)]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Acceleration x3]
 </p>
 <p>
  I moved my hand reflexively.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just before it was about to fall, the steel ball bounced up due to the penalty. The steel ball moved across the field at the speed of a bullet.
 </p>
 <p>
  A puzzle game of Super God-like level.

 <p>
  The difficulty of the puzzle itself was a challenge. But the bigger challenge was that the consecutive puzzles kept coming without a moment’s rest. I moved my hands busily.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sweat began to trickle down my body.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I think it’s 5 minutes.’
 </p>
 <p>
  All 13 types of games were completed.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [14. Cube Puzzle (Super God-like + Double Penalty)]
 </p>
 <p>
  [35 X 35]
 </p>
 <p>
  The screen rotated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Starting again from the beginning, with a slightly higher difficulty than before.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Great!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The spirit of hell is embedded in the Primordial Forge!]
 </p>
 <p>
  A flame, three meters in size, erupted from the lake.
 </p>
 <p>
  After the flames subsided, a shining sword was placed in the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Modeling complete. Moving on to the next step.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  [15. Maze Finding]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Time Limit – 00 : 30 : 00]
 </p>
 <p>
  A convoluted picture resembling a spiral appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  A small ball was placed in the center of the picture. I moved the ball with my hand as if rolling it.
 </p>
 <p>
  After passing through dozens of intersections, the ball escaped to the exit.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Great!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The terror of hell is embedded in the Primordial Forge!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Dozens of magic circles in the lake shrank and gathered together.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Automatic Restoration (A)’ Enchantment Successful!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Special Bond (S)’ Enchantment Successful!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Strength Reinforcement (S)’ Enchantment…….]
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Once again, flames erupted from the lake.
 </p>
 <p>
  The leaping flames covered the unfinished sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each time the sword was engulfed in flames, it vibrated intensely.

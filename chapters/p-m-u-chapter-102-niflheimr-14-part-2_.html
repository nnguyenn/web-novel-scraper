  The sword body, submerged in lava, finally revealed its form. Black characters were engraved on the white sword body. It has been 20 minutes. The work was in its final stages.

  I exhaled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is the last one,” Yurnet said.
 </p>
 <p>
  Without replying, I raised my hand to the screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Five minutes later.

  A somewhat tacky success message appeared.
 </p>

  I let my arm down.

 <p>
  The floating shelves around Yurnet disappeared in light.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Was there… no mistake?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I drank the water Yurnet handed to me and asked.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since the 20th minute, I hadn’t been keeping track of time properly. It was unclear whether the puzzle was a success or failure.
 </p>
 <p>
  “As you can see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet pointed ahead.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the lake. The sword was floating above the forge. When Yurnet waved her hand, the sword and scabbard flew toward us.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s perfect.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After Yurnet put the sword into the scabbard, she handed it to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I accepted the sword. The weight was substantial and transmitted through my arm.

  I almost lost my strength for a moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Still, I succeeded in just one attempt.’
 </p>
 <p>
  From Super God-like and above, one had to be prepared for several failures.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bryunak and Ruien three times. Claid Solais twice. Nagelpar four times. When making Leviathan, I had to throw away materials a whopping 11 times.
 </p>
 <p>
  I raised my head and examined the sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sword was longer and thicker than a typical one-handed sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, it wasn’t as brute-like as a greatsword. It seemed to be a versatile weapon that could be wielded with one hand or both depending on the situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud.
 </p>
 <p>
  I swung the sword in the scabbard.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was my first time using it, but the balance felt just right.

 <p>
  Next, I examined the appearance of the sword.

 <p>
  The black scabbard was intricately engraved with angular patterns.
 </p>
 <p>
  As I drew the sword, the white blade emitted a sinister light.
 </p>
 <p>
  Externally, there was nothing particularly flashy about it.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was just as I had thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t bother carrying weapons for the show. I had no desire to attract attention. As long as it was practical, that was enough for me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why did you link it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I asked while holding the sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  The third note had an unfamiliar word written on it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Because I was worried about you going alone…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet lowered her gaze.
 </p>
 <p>
  I smirked and said, “So, what did you put in it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a dimensional leap. You can summon weapons from Niflheimr to the Master’s side.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve never heard of such an enchantment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s because the Master’s sword possesses tremendous power.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet continued to explain.
 </p>
 <p>
  The growth-type weapon, Bifrost, of U-grade, had tremendous interference potential, and it could be used to perform a dimensional leap in conjunction with Proof of Transcendence.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No matter how great the Master is, they can’t know the unpredictable events of this world. Even the Master…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I know.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I replied.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how much you prepare and anticipate, unexpected events happen.
 </p>

  That was the rule of “Pick Me Up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “When Master is truly in danger, use it, but only for three times.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t you like it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet looked at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  My eyes were wavering.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you permit it, I would rather leave Niflheimr and go to the Master’s side.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s not allowed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “In that case, please accept this gift. If the Master were to pass away unexpectedly, we would have no one to rely on.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I sighed.

 <p>
  “Okay, I got it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The weapons from Niflheimr can be summoned. Three chances. Any other conditions?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I apologize, but the output will be reduced within the main mission. The coordinates are too far away. You probably won’t be able to use it more than once during a mission.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t plan on doing it anyway.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Niflheimr’s weapons were undoubtedly powerful.
 </p>
 <p>
  Depending on how they were used, they could provide tremendous power. However, using them within the main mission posed a problem.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Anytng is watching.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If a game character suddenly pulled out a super weapon and wiped out the enemies, bug reports might start flying. The “Pick Me Up” customer support was famous for giving substantial rewards to bug reporters.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, opportunities are limited to when the Master is not watching or cannot see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Such situations were rare but not unheard of.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Rather than using it in a crisis…’
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed better to time it and use it directly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anyway.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I unfastened the straps of the sword and shield.
 </p>
 <p>
  These had been my partners for almost two months since the day they were created.
 </p>
 <p>
  Splash.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I threw the two items into the lava, they melted in less than three seconds.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bubbling bubbles burst and the sword and shield disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Bifrost.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the sword in my hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Right now, it was just a sturdy, unbreakable sword. But as time passes and it gains experience, it will reveal its true value.
 </p>
 <p>
  I hung the new sword on my belt.

  “…Master, what are you thinking?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nothing. Just some thoughts.”
 </p>

 <p>
  I shook my head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anyway, I want to repay you for what you did for me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you’re willing…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Except for staying here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet suddenly looked disappointed.
 </p>
 <p>
  I smirked and said, “What? Are you saying, there’s not much I can do?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, it’s not like that. Just… if you could… Contact you guys once in a while?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Contact you guys once in a while?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “As I mentioned before, the ring I gave you as a gift has communication functions. You can communicate with us even in Townia. It won’t last long, though.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet taught me how to use it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Turn the ring to the left and bring it close to your mouth to speak.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Like this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s sound good.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet smiled warmly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Once a week is enough. Just to check how you’re doing, whether you’re in good health, and if you’ve encountered any difficulties. If there’s anything we can help with, we’ll rush to your aid.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s quite a burden.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I quickly spoke before Yurnet got disheartened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anyway, understood. I’ll contact you once a week. If I need Niflheimr’s help, I’ll reach out.”

 <p>
  “Anytime.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I thought to myself, ‘When the time that I need Niflheimr’s full support  comes…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The situation would be at its very worst.
 </p>
 <p>
  To the point where it’s almost impossible to use my hands. I can only hope it doesn’t come to that.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master, it seems that Ridgion also wants to meet you. He said he wants to give you advice.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t come to see me off.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I moved on.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet remained standing by the table.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is this the last time?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The planned departure time is 2:00 PM in the afternoon. Once I leave here, I won’t be able to meet Yurnet for a while.

 <p>
  Yurnet bowed to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her thin white hair flowed downward.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yurnet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll never forget your help.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll pray for Master’s good fortune.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled and left the garden.
 </p>
 <p>
  Next, the farewell with Ridgion proceeded calmly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Until the moment we parted, he taught me everything about swordsmanship.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve said everything I wanted to say.”

 <p>
  When he was leaving, Ridgion said,
 </p>
 <p>
  “The next time we meet, I won’t need words, I’ll just show you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Behind Ridgion’s uniform, his sword swayed.
 </p>
 <p>
  I left Iron Mountain.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, there are only three members left. But all three sectors are empty.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘We’ll meet someday.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I took the elevator down.
 </p>
 <p>
  I entered the annex on the second floor and organized my belongings. There wasn’t much to take. Two auxiliary daggers and one spare health potion were all I had. I strapped them to my belt and left the room. My illusion was already gone.
 </p>
 <p>
  I went out to the training ground of the annex.
 </p>
 <p>
  The recruits were gathered, ready to depart.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Over here, Oppa! Here!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna waved from a corner of the training ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  I joined Jenna.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Today, it’s goodbye to this place. Feels like it’s been about a year.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The time wasn’t wasted.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, that’s true. You taught me in great detail before. Thanks to you, I learned a lot. But I still prefer where we originally came from.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna smiled, scratching her cheek.
 </p>
 <p>
  Following the instructor’s guidance, we set off for the dimensional rift.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I want to take a bath when I get back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t the bath here better?”
 </p>

 <p>
  “The facilities here are better, but the other place feels more familiar. Anyway.”
 </p>
 <p>
  We chatted casually as we walked.
 </p>
 <p>
  We came with three people, but one seat was empty. Jenna didn’t bring up that topic.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I wonder how it’ll change when we get back. There must be many new comrades, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  In the hangar, Landgrid-07 was waiting.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the ship we rode when we came here. We boarded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s been a month, right? Have you all learned well? I hope your experience in Niflheimr will be a great help!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lydel spoke cheerfully.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the same time, the shuttle began to move slowly.
 </p>
 <p>
  In front of the shuttle, the whirlpool of dimensions was spinning.
 </p>

 <p>
  Light enveloped the shuttle.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I opened my eyes, I saw a familiar sight.
 </p>
 <p>
  A volcano erupting lava and thick sulfur clouds. It was outside of Niflheimr.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s dangerous outside, so don’t lean out. Don’t come out recklessly, okay?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I leaned my arm on the railing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the moving shuttle, Niflheimr’s tower was getting farther away.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘When will I come back next?’
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s no way I can’t come back if I force it, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Dimensional jump, ready!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The shuttle began to shake.
 </p>

 <p>
  I turned my gaze to the tower.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  At one end of the floating island next to it.
 </p>
 <p>
  A blurry human figure caught my eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was hard to see because of the distance. I concentrated my vision.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That’s…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Golden hair like the sun.
 </p>
 <p>
  She was looking in this direction with a sword plunged into the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  The crimson flames emanating from the sword dyed the sky red.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ve seen her many times.
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t forget the color of those flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Levatein.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Series Agentheim.
 </p>
 <p>
  The strongest in Niflheimr and ranked first.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘You knew, huh?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Series was staring at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  The distance was considerable, but her burning gaze was clearly felt.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Not yet.’
 </p>

 <p>
  I smiled.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now is not the time to meet her.
 </p>
 <p>
  Someday, when I’ve truly become stronger.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oppa, why are you looking like that? It’s like you’re trying to see through something.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s nothing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned my gaze away.
 </p>
 <p>
  The light of dimensional jump enveloped the shuttle.

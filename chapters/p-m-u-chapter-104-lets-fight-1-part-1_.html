 <p>
  &lt;Announcement for passengers on the ship!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  I woke up.
 </p>

 <p>
  The bunk in the cabin was gently swaying with me on it.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;The ship will arrive at Townia soon. Please disembark on the deck!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked out the window.
 </p>
 <p>
  Beyond the glass, a desolate wasteland and the sight of a tower were visible.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dimension 1935 – Townia]
 </p>
 <p>
  I got out of bed.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;The two passengers from Townia, please get ready!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Lydel’s voice echoed.
 </p>
 <p>
  I glanced to my side, but Jenna wasn’t there. It seemed like she had left while I was still asleep. I exited the cabin and headed for the deck. On the way, I ran into Jenna.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, Oppa. I was just about to go look for you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you take everything? You didn’t forget something, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, I’ve taken care of everything we brought. Don’t worry.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna and I walked side by side.
 </p>
 <p>
  As we stepped onto the deck, a refreshing breeze brushed against our cheeks. The airship was approaching the Dimensional Rift near the tower. Lydel, who had been standing on the left side of the deck, turned this way.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, there you are! The two top students have arrived. First and second place side by side! You know, I’ve heard the rumors. It’s a shame that the two of you didn’t stay in Niflheimr.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We have colleagues waiting for us.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, there’s nothing to be done then. It’s a shame.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lydel smiled and turned his gaze.

 <p>
  The Dimensional Rift began to engulf the airship from the front.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then.
 </p>
 <p>
  As momentum built up in my body, the scenery changed in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  A high ceiling and a straight corridor that extended forward and backward. It was a rift in dimensions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Familiar messages appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Assignment complete!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★★★)’ and ‘Jenna (★★★)’ have safely returned from ‘Niphleheim’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★★★)’ and ‘Jenna (★★★)’ are now operable.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [※ The hero’s status has changed due to the assignment effect. Check the ‘Hero’ tab for details!]
 </p>
 <p>
  It was Anytng’s guidance window.

 <p>
  From here on, it was considered Townia’s territory.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Stairs, deploying.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Click.
 </p>
 <p>
  Stairs assembled from the railing extended downward.
 </p>
 <p>
  I walked down the stairs. Behind the railing, Lydel waved his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I wish you a safe journey!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna came down with me.
 </p>
 <p>
  As we stepped onto the rift in dimensions, the airship began to reverse.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ring!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Niflheimr’-affiliated Airship ‘Landgrid 07’ is departing.]
 </p>

 <p>
  The Landgrid ship was drawn into the Dimensional Rift and gradually disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  The unique movement noise of the airship disappeared. All that remained was silence.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s quiet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna muttered, looking up.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked up as well. The sky was a murky black. The Master wasn’t connected. Judging by the color, it seemed to be late at night. Jenna scratched her cheek.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I wonder if they’ll be waiting for us.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We didn’t even tell them when we will return, how will they know?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I had only mentioned it would take about a month, I hadn’t specified the exact arrival time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Except for the two of us; the vast rift in dimensions was empty.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s go to our lodgings. I’ll get a good night’s sleep in my room, and we can meet tomorrow. As for now, you…”

 <p>
  Jenna looked at me and tilted her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…It seems that you need some time alone, Oppa. I’ll go ahead!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna ran toward the exit.
 </p>
 <p>
  “She’s quick to catch on.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I smirked and looked to the side.
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the shadow, stardust twinkled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you doing in there? Why are you hiding?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Lokiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!]
 </p>
 <p>
  A small girl the size of my arm emerged from inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  Black hair and two pairs of transparent wings. It was Iselle.
 </p>

  [You came back! I didn’t think you would, I really didn’t think you would!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “How long have you been waiting?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I’ve been waiting for a long time, thinking you wouldn’t come back.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle took out a handkerchief and wiped her eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  The handkerchief was soaked with tears.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You told me to come back, and I promised you I would. So why were you even worried?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [But compared to being stuck in a place like this, Niflheimr is amazing, right? Didn’t they stop you from going back?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “They did try to stop me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [So you fought back for me… right?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Tears welled up in Iselle’s eyes again.
 </p>

 <p>
  ‘…For you.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I decided to bury the truth.
 </p>
 <p>
  I don’t like ruining something I cherish. Besides, it’s not 100% unrelated.
 </p>
 <p>
  It took Iselle about ten minutes to calm down.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle, who had regained her usual liveliness, circled around me.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Anyway, you’re back! Are you tired? Today, let’s go to the lodging and rest. The facilities are top-notch. It’s not the Townia of the past. It has changed a lot.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yeah, you’ll be surprised.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle nodded with her hand on her waist.
 </p>
 <p>
  I started walking.
 </p>

 <p>
  It has been ten days in real time since we left Townia. In the game time, it’s been a month.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s not a short period. If Anytng had been playing the game steadily, there might have been some changes, whether external or internal. I walked out to the square on the second floor through the open door.
 </p>
 <p>
  The square hadn’t changed much.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was a fountain in the center, surrounded by benches. Due to the time, there were no pedestrians in sight. However, something familiar was placed on the right wall. I could tell at a glance.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was stairs.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did he add a third floor?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, it has! Townia now has three floors!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle said enthusiastically before continuing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The first floor is just for useless leftovers! The second floor is for support staff and less experienced prospects. And the third floor is for…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Combat roles.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Exactly! The food tastes better, the beds are softer, and there’s plenty of fun things to do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I pumped my fist.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first floor is for newcomers without skills. The second floor is for support staff and aspiring combatants. The third floor is for the main heroes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng was still using the structure I had in mind even in the third-floor waiting room. It meant he still believed in my strategy.

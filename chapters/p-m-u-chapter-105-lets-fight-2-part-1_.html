 <p>
  I ascended to the third floor, leaving Iselle behind.
 </p>
 <p>
  From the first party to the third, it was a place reserved only for main combatants. The structure of the third floor wasn’t much different from the second; the most recognizable thing is that the training ground entrance was slightly wider.

 <p>
  I walked towards my lodging.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang! Clang! Clang!
 </p>
 <p>
  I stopped in my tracks.
 </p>
 <p>
  Passing by the training grounds, I heard an unfamiliar noise. It was the sound of metal clashing against metal. I peered inside through the half-opened door.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Velkist.”
 </p>
 <p>
  There, in front of what looked like a human-shaped steel doll, Velkist was swinging his sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish! The blade sliced through the air with a piercing sound, leaving an afterimage as it darted in all directions. Sparks flew as the metal clashed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist whole body was drenched in sweat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you doing? It’s late.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I said as I entered the training grounds.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sword stopped. Velkist turned to look at me, his narrowed eyes piercing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, it’s you, senior. It’s been a month.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I just got here. Is something going on?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nothing special. Just training.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It looks like you’re taking it out on a perfectly good dummy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t mind me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist glanced at the dummy and then sheathed his sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  His exposed forearm glistened with sweat. I looked down and saw that his grip was tearing his hand apart, and blood was flowing steadily. Velkist’s expression remained nonchalant as if it was nothing.

  “Just give me a minute. Just one minute. Then, let’s have a match.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was planning to go in and get some rest.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just one round.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I straightened up from where I had been leaning against the wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist’s eyes turned cold. I hadn’t seen this expression on him much since we met.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang! Clang!! Clang!!! Clang!!!!
 </p>
 <p>
  He kept striking down the doll, and the fourth and final strike shattered one of the dummy’s shoulders.
 </p>
 <p>
  Broken pieces of metal scattered around.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ready?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist extended his sword.

  “Sorry for not saying hello earlier.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you call that a greeting.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled and stepped onto the practice grounds.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist’s eyebrows twitched.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t see a shield. Did you throw it away? Why are you wielding such a strange sword?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve had quite a month.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  I drew Bifrost.
 </p>
 <p>
  The blade gleamed coldly under the training grounds’ lights.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a nice sword.”

  “Are you jealous?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If I say that, will you give it to me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s not happening.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist chuckled wickedly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, he took a deep breath and suddenly charged.
 </p>
 <p>
  As his feet moved, his arm swung. The sword in his right-hand thrust like an arrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang!
 </p>
 <p>
  I blocked with the side of my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist’s attacks continued. Thrusts, upward slashes, and diagonal strikes, all flowed like water. I parried and dodged, saying as I did.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems like something is bothering you.”

 <p>
  “It is what it is.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I deflected the sword tip aimed at my groin.
 </p>
 <p>
  He still showed no mercy.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He has definitely improved.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Sharper and cleaner than what I remember.
 </p>
 <p>
  As I blocked and dodged, the relentless attacks kept coming. Let my guard down for a moment, and blood would be pouring from my body.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘His lower-level swordsmanship is at least Level 9.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Learning from Ridgion allowed me to estimate Velkist’s skills a bit.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a noticeable growth. However,
 </p>
 <p>
  I gripped the sword hilt.
 </p>

 <p>
  I put strength into my toes, bent my waist, and swung the sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh! The wind screamed. There was no way to avoid it. Velkist brought the sword to meet mine. When the swords clashed, a dull sound echoed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shi-at!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist, along with the sword, flew and slammed into the iron bars.
 </p>
 <p>
  I lifted Velkist, who was about to collapse.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you’re going to fight, at least wipe the sweat off. Don’t go picking on someone while you’re already tired; you won’t even show your true skills.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You filthy… You’ve gotten stronger. Did you take some kind of potion? I thought I was going to break when I clashed swords with you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s a company secret, buddy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  We left the practice grounds.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist put his nearly broken sword back in its sheath and muttered.
 </p>

  “But, you know, life is really strange sometimes. I never imagined I’d break so easily in front of a brat.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A brat?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Be careful, senior. Even from just the appearance… no, you’ll probably figure it out just from the appearance.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The reason for Velkist’s anger became somewhat clear. I smiled and said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is the newcomer really that strong?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The other four are worth a try. But there’s one problem. Do you know, senior? In your absence, they…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I heard they reached the 25th floor.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, there’s no need to say more. That guy…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist’s expression seemed to darken as if he was remembering something, and there was a strong sense of displeasure in his gaze.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anyway, be cautious of that guy.”

  “He’s not an enemy, so why bother? Having a strong guy around makes climbing the Tower easier.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They might not see it the same way. Anyway, I’ve said my piece. I’m heading out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist put on his coat and headed outside the training facility.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he left,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Welcome back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He left with those words.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s pointless.’
 </p>
 <p>
  We’re going the same way anyway.
 </p>
 <p>
  I followed Velkist.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I opened the door to the lodging, something strange caught my eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm…”
 </p>
 <p>
  A woman in pajamas was dozing off on the sofa.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you sleeping?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “… “
 </p>
 <p>
  No response.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka stood with her back straight, tilting her head as she sat in a cross-legged position.
 </p>
 <p>
  Why isn’t she lying in her bed but sitting here? I ignored her and walked past.
 </p>
 <p>
  I surveyed the lobby’s corridor.
 </p>
 <p>
  The layout had changed slightly. It had split into three paths.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I see.”
 </p>

 <p>
  I had a feeling I knew the purpose.
 </p>
 <p>
  I headed to the left. Soon, a small parlor came into view.
 </p>
 <p>
  And in the inner corridor, there were five doors.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He has categorized lodgings by parties.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Until now, we had simply chosen rooms randomly, but now he was assigning rooms by party.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the concept of group living.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the clock on the parlor’s wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was past 3 in the morning. I was getting sleepy. The empty one among the five is most likely my room.
 </p>
 <p>
  I entered it.

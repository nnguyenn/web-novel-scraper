 <p>
  Finally, Anytng’s daily work came to an end.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sitting on a bench, I immediately muttered to myself.

  ‘Record viewing request. 25th floor.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★★★)’ requests record viewing.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Floor – 25th floor]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tips/Drag and drop the playback stone to the hero box! You can show the hero videos of the desired floor. Heroes utilize the experience they gain in strategies. Keep in mind!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tips2/Playback stones can be obtained with a low probability in the Inferior Isralta Mine. If the hero has gathering skills, the probability increases.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The request window appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  After about a minute of silence, Anytng began to operate.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Do you want to use the playback stone on Han (★★★)?’]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Floor – 25th floor]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Remaining playback stones – 7]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes (Select) / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  They listen well.
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled and got up from my seat. The located rift of time and space is on the 1st floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  I went straight down the stairs. The front of the 1st-floor plaza. The door leading to the rift was wide open. Without hesitation, I entered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clunk.
 </p>
 <p>
  The door closed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The center of the rift.
 </p>
 <p>
  The three mirrors symbolizing the main dungeon, day-of-the-week dungeon, and exploration dungeon disappeared into the darkness. This time, it was not light but shadows that filled this place. Shadows seeped out from the cracks in the walls and engulfed me from below.

  [‘Han (★★★)’ begins viewing!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Darkness covered my vision.
 </p>
 <p>
  And when I opened my eyes again,
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Is this a desert?”
 </p>
 <p>
  A golden light covered the view.
 </p>
 <p>
  The richly colored sand formed numerous dunes, extending beyond the horizon. The wind, carrying sand, swept down from the hills.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked up.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sun was shining brightly, causing the atmosphere to shimmer. It would easily exceed 35 degrees due to the excessive heat.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But it’s not affecting me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled and continued walking.
 </p>

 <p>
  As expected, the environment here had no effect on me. The scorching sunlight and the raging sandstorm were just decorations. The wind and sunshine seemed to avoid me as if a protective barrier surrounded me.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should prepare when I reach the 26th floor.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I continued walking, reviewing the items needed for desert exploration.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the desert was vast, the destination was clear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just 50 meters ahead, near the oasis, a village was situated. Cliffs on both sides framed it.
 </p>
 <p>
  I ignored the two guards guarding the entrance to the village and walked past them.
 </p>
 <p>
  They didn’t even glance in my direction. It would be more accurate to say they couldn’t.
 </p>
 <p>
  I entered the village.
 </p>
 <p>
  Starting from the blue oasis in the center of the village, white buildings sprawled irregularly. Pedestrians covered themselves with thick white cloth, walking along the brick streets.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The type of mission.’
 </p>

 <p>
  I thought as I walked down the road.
 </p>
 <p>
  The field is a desert. It’s clear that this village area is the main stage for the mission. Kishasha and the third party entered this village and cleared the 25th floor. However, the type of mission had not been revealed yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll find out after I look around.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I headed towards the oasis.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, while doing so, I suddenly looked back.
 </p>
 <p>
  Tap, tap, tap.
 </p>
 <p>
  Someone was running down the street.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I watched that person closely.
 </p>
 <p>
  Wrapped in cloth from head to toe, there was no way to see their lower body, upper body, or even their face. Their hair was tied up, but I couldn’t tell if it was in a bun or not. Only their golden eyes were visible.

  “Guessing from the shape of her body, she’s a woman.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I followed her quickly for a simple reason.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Catch that guy!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Call the others! Block the entrance and don’t let a single ant escape!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Six or seven guards behind her were chasing her with weapons in hand. Their expressions were determined.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Get the wanted poster out. Are you sure it’s her?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The middle-aged man leading the charge said.
 </p>
 <p>
  The young boy behind him took out a piece of paper.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh, well… Silver hair, golden eyes. Speaks like a refined noble. Has a mole below the neck… Can’t you tell by looking at her? She stands out!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s true. We’ll crush that bi*ch!”

  “Hey! You’re the witch who conspired with the demon!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The guards showered her with insults.
 </p>
 <p>
  Under the cloth covering her nose, the woman’s pink lips quivered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hooooo!
 </p>
 <p>
  Somewhere, a strong gust of wind swept in.
 </p>
 <p>
  For a brief moment, the footsteps of the fugitive and pursuers halted. The cloth floated into the air, carried by the wind.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s been a while.
 </p>
 <p>
  I muttered to myself.
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis Al Ragnar.
 </p>
 <p>
  The star of the 15th floor was standing here.

  ‘I can’t call her a kid anymore.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The petite figure that barely reached my chest had grown taller, now reaching my shoulders.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her log-like body had slimmed down. Her once-flowing silver hair was now cut short, reaching her neck. Her golden eyes gleamed brightly. The reckless, fidgety child from not too long ago had turned into a poised lady.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seems like she’s the one. Priasis Al Ragna! The Empire’s traitor!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right, we’ve hit the jackpot!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The guards surrounded Priasis, spreading out on both sides.
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis, looking at them, said, “Can you let me go?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What, did something go wrong? Why should we let you go?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have something I need to find. I won’t harm you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Haven’t you caused enough harm? My son got sick because of you. He’s dying at home right now. Isn’t that enough? And wasn’t it you who made the monsters go crazy all of a sudden?”
 </p>

  “What I did…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shut up!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The guard at the front interrupted.
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis wore a bitter expression and turned away. Her steps quickened. She was trying to escape before they completed the encirclement.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Should I shoot an arrow?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re paid just to bring her corpse back. Take her down!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Three guards simultaneously pulled out crossbows.
 </p>
 <p>
  The bolts were already loaded into the crossbows. The scopes were aimed at Priasis. All it would take was a pull of the trigger, and her frail body would become a pincushion.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s about time they show up.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I leaned against the building’s wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  Three bolts were shot towards Priasys.

 <p>
  It has already been set.
 </p>
 <p>
  After returning to the third-floor training grounds, I spoke to the members.

 <p>
  “Tomorrow, we’re heading to the 25th floor. It’s been a while since we had a real battle.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s fast.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist, who was sitting on a chair while lifting weights, said.
 </p>
 <p>
  The weight was about 30kg. He lifted it as if it were a 5kg weight and then lowered it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then we will be staying up all night today, right? If we want to regain our senses two hours won’t cut it”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We won’t stay up all night. We can’t afford to ruin our condition. We’ll train harder than usual though. Tell everyone to gather.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll call Eloka.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa went into the Magic Hall’s door.
 </p>
 <p>
  Next, Jenna came down from the shooting range. Eloka came out with Neryssa.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re going in starting tomorrow?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why, do you have a problem with that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not that I have a problem… It’s just that you seem different. Your shield is nowhere to be seen, and we’ve changed too. Going into battle after just one day seems a bit fast, doesn’t it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry. Your role won’t change much. Just do what you’ve been doing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t have a shield, but my role within the party remained the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took on the role of the front-line attacker along with Velkist, blocking attacks heading to the rear. Jenna focused on the shortbow, Neryssa excelled at mid-range combat, and Eloka used magic in the rear. It was a simple yet efficient formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It doesn’t matter how strong I’ve become.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I’m going to still act as the party’s vanguard.
 </p>
 <p>
  We fight shoulder to shoulder. It was a basic rule for survival. I knew well how overconfident heroes meet their end.

 <p>
  The second party was mobilized for formation training to improve our combat sense.
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis nodded in agreement when I asked. She said she would help anytime if needed. She had also said that she had been waiting eagerly to train with us.
 </p>
 <p>
  “From the left, Annan, Benik, Lilinia.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis introduced the members of the newly joined second party.
 </p>
 <p>
  All three of them were not very old, in their late teens to early twenties. Their eyes sparkled with admiration as they looked at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve heard a lot about you, hyungnim! I’ve even seen you in action when you defeated the Black Dragon. It was amazing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Annan approached me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Annan was a young man with attractive blond hair. He wore simple leather armor, had a sleek longsword at his waist, and a round shield on his back.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This guy…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I recalled something from the past.
 </p>

 <p>
  The two who called me “hyungnim” and followed me around. They also used the same sword style as me. They died bleeding on the 5th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Zeet and Hanson.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled bitterly.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had no regrets, and I would make the same choice again if I had to, but there was a lingering bitterness.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m Benik. I’ve heard a lot about you. Nice to meet you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He may seem like this, but he’s a passionate guy once you get to know him.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Annan chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t say unnecessary things.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Benik, a calm-looking young man, twitched.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had a pair of daggers and a shortbow on his belt, the same weapon choice as Edis.

 <p>
  “I, I’m Lilinia.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally, the quiet girl who had been standing somewhat shyly bowed to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  For some reason, her expression seemed quite stiff. A large spear hung on her back, taller than her. After looking at the three of them, Edis said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They joined the second party two weeks ago. They’re enthusiastic, and their combat performance is not bad. They’ll be a big help in future missions.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll do our best!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your voice is too loud.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis laughed gently.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a smile I hadn’t seen in a while. I whispered quietly to Edis so the three of them couldn’t hear me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Give it your all but in moderation. It’ll get tough later if you don’t.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s okay.”
 </p>

 <p>
  Edis reassured.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This time, we won’t let anyone die.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘An unpredictable woman.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis Callen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seems cold, but secretly caring. When Asher and Diran died, she seemed calm on the surface, but I could tell she was heartbroken. Not your typical mercenary.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What do I know?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the three of them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Vibrant Annan, composed Benik, and quiet Lilinia. Even at a glance, they seemed to get along well. It reminded me of the old trio.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘My thoughts have wandered for too long.’

 <p>
  I erased my sense of complacency.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no time to get lost in thoughts. If I wanted to get enough sleep, I had to focus on training right now. Swish. I drew my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s not waste any time. Form groups of five. Attack us as if you’re trying to kill the enemy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are we really doing this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lilinia, who had been fiddling with her wooden spear, asked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You want us to pretend, then? Throw away the practice weapons and use the real ones behind you. It’s okay even if you get hurt.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s do it as Han suggested. You don’t need to feel pressured.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lilinia nodded and drew her long spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis took out his dagger. Following her, Roderick, Benik, and Anan also drew their weapons.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t just stand there watching. Sloppy movements will just waste time.”
 </p>

 <p>
  ‘They’re probably not skilled enough.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis and Roderick were quite powerful.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the three in the back hadn’t become strong enough yet. You could tell just by looking at how they drew their weapons.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That timid girl was in the same party as me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist, who had drawn his sword, chuckled coldly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you know her?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I know her. She was right beside me when we were first summoned. She was so scared that she was just in the way. I thought she’d be stuck on the 1st floor for the rest of her life, but somehow, she made it up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “She’s talented. Her soft self is what’s in the way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa added.
 </p>
 <p>
  The second party was gathered in a circle and discussed their plans.
 </p>

 <p>
  Watching this, Eloka complained.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The atmosphere is so different. They look harmonious over there. Our party members are all ice blocks except for one. No fun, no consideration, no romance, and no fighting spirit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Does fun put food on the table?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Agreed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s true.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka shook her head and walked away slowly.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were forming their formations.
 </p>
 <p>
  A while later, the first party and the second party clashed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The main goal was to improve our combat sense in group battles.
 </p>
 <p>
  I could probably handle it alone if I set my mind to it, but I refrained from doing so this time. The key was to maintain the formation while recovering our senses. So, we started practicing the tug of war between formations with minimal movement.
 </p>
 <p>
  The purpose of the formation was to maintain combat effectiveness while reducing the members’ stamina consumption, covering each other’s weaknesses, and enhancing their strengths.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how strong I had become, I couldn’t match Eloka’s rapid firepower alone.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, receiving long-range support from rear members was several times stronger than fighting alone.
 </p>
 <p>
  In that sense, the second party served as a good practice opponent.
 </p>
 <p>
  The tactical objectives of the second party kept changing. They concentrated on attacking Eloka at times, then focused on me and Velkist, and occasionally made a move on Jenna and Neryssa. Colliding naturally like this allowed us to revive our old senses.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s no threat with wooden swords. It’s dull. You can’t kill with this!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist said it like it was nothing, but well, there was no other way.
 </p>
 <p>
  We couldn’t force the training style of the first party, which didn’t use practice weapons at all, on the second party. Each party had its own characteristics.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the night grew darker,
 </p>

 <p>
  During the break, Edis spoke to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Han, don’t go easy like just now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I didn’t.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You only focused on defense. They need to get hurt a bit too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can I kill them, then?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course you can’t!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just kidding.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I laughed and looked back.
 </p>
 <p>
  The four members of the first party were sitting in chairs, resting.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You heard, right? You can do whatever you want as long as you don’t kill them.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “…Should have I not said that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  In the next clash, the three members of the second party were carried out in less than a minute.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had reduced my strength to some extent, but it was inevitable that they would get hurt. It was what Edis wanted.

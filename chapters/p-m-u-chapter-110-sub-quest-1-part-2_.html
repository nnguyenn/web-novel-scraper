  Regardless, it seems we have accomplished what we wanted from this training session.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems like we’ve done it somehow.”

  “The rest will come back in real battles, won’t it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Training couldn’t substitute for real battles.
 </p>
 <p>
  The stage was the 25th floor. Going down to lower floors would be fine, but we had already wasted enough time. We had identified the difficulty, and we had recovered my senses enough to use them. I explained the field and monsters on the 25th floor to each member.
 </p>
 <p>
  The field was a desert.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hundreds of lizardmen would appear.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Warriors are nothing special. Just kill them like you’re dealing with goblins. But the spellcasters can be a bit annoying. Kill them right away. Jenna, take care of it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But they all look like lizards?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They’re carrying strange staffs. You’ll know when you see them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If you don’t deal with the spellcasters in time, they’ll enrage the other lizardmen.
 </p>
 <p>
  The situation can get quite troublesome.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But, in a desert… isn’t it hot?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka wrinkled her brow.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, it is.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I feel like I’ll get tired.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka flapped her dress hem.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a reasonable concern. Desert fields weren’t a comfortable environment for fighting. Although it didn’t affect me in the record viewing, once we entered, we would feel the temperature.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anyway, I’ll handle that part. You don’t need to worry about it.”

  “Is that all?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. Go wash up and get some sleep. Don’t stay up all night training.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I got up from my seat.
 </p>
 <p>
  Leaving the members heading to their quarters behind, I went down to the first floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  My destination was the warehouse. It was where dozens of items were stored. As I descended the stairs, I muttered to myself.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Iselle.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The air flickered, and Iselle popped out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite her small voice, she responded immediately.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I want to manipulate information.”

  [What are you talking about? Information manipulation?]
 </p>
 <p>
  I extended the ring that was hooked on my left index finger.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle, who had her eyes wide open, approached the ring.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her small finger touched the surface of the ring. Then…
 </p>
 <p>
  [Neat!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Keep it down.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Where did you get this?!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s from Niflheimr. I got it from someone I know.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Could it be! That Yurnet Seed? The strongest illusionist…?]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘How do you know about that?’

  I clicked my tongue.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anyway, with this ring, you can deceive the master’s attention. From now on, I’m going to make items, and you’re going to deceive him.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t plan to make any particularly special items.
 </p>
 <p>
  At best, they were consumables. Still, as long as I was cautious, there shouldn’t be any losses.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle accepted the request immediately, saying that with this level of item, it should be possible. Thus…

  [‘Han (★★★)’ has created ‘Heat Protection Potion’!]
 </p>
 <p>
  I made special potions in the Magic Hall.
 </p>
 <p>
  The item was called ‘Heat Protection Potion,’ and it had the effect of preventing heat-related conditions for a certain period of time. It was perfect for the desert or volcanic areas.
 </p>
 <p>
  With this, the basic preparations for the sub-quest were complete.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the next evening.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Welcome to Pick Me Up!]

 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  [Loading is complete.]

 </p>
 <p>
  [Will you accept?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes (Select) / No]

 <p>
  There wasn’t much hesitation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng touched ‘Yes.’

 </p>
 <p>
  Thud.
 </p>
 <p>
  With Iselle’s energetic voice, the Rift of Time and Space opened.

 <p>
  All the members of the 1st party, including me, entered the Rift.
 </p>
 <p>
  The mirror in the center began to shine immediately.

  [Main Dungeon, current challenge floor is the 25th floor.]

  “We know that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  My whole body was enveloped in light.
 </p>
 <p>
  And…
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  In front of my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is this where it starts?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis, kneeling, had her eyes tightly closed.

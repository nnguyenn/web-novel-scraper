  ‘So you’re going to find that ‘key’ thing?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled.

  [00:00:00]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Quest Success!]
 </p>
 <p>
  A message appeared in my field of vision.
 </p>
 <p>
  Quest success. There were no attacks after the initial assault.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Mission has changed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Mission Type – Escape]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Objective – Escape from the city with the escort target.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [※Notice]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Since this is a quest that has already been cleared, adjustments will be applied.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Enemies disappear.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A bright light flashed in the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry about it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I replied shortly.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the opposite side of the street, Lizardmen turned into light and disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  It probably wouldn’t be visible to Priasis’s eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s head out. We’re going out through the north gate, right?”

  “That’s right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you ready?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have all the basic items taken care of.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis looked at the backpack behind her.
 </p>
 <p>
  A bag made of white leather was bulging.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m done talking. You can come out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Three people walked out of the alley.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What did you talk about?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why? Are you curious? It’s just idle chatter with no real content.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, that’s fine.”

  Velkist replied curtly and scanned the surroundings.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The corpses are gone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh? Really, they’re gone. It’s clean now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka opened her eyes wide.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the two of them said, the area that had been covered with Lizardmen corpses had suddenly become clean.
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Whenever I’m with you, strange things always happen.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s true.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I laughed and continued walking.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no need to delay. The monsters were gone, and after guiding them to the north gate, my job was done.

 <p>
  ‘…’
 </p>
 <p>
  As I walked down the street, I briefly pondered about this mysterious world reminiscent of a mobile game.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Priasis Al Ragnar.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I recalled the memories of the 15th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  We weren’t the first party who challenged it.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was back when we were on strike.
 </p>
 <p>
  The previous third party formed by Anytng with paid summons had attempted the challenge…
 </p>
 <p>
  They had all been wiped out due to mission failure.
 </p>
 <p>
  In other words…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Priasis has died at least once.’
 </p>

 <p>
  The current Priasis was the second event.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No, is it the third?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The mission process had changed due to this sub-quest.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s an unknown place.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  It hadn’t been ordinary from the beginning.
 </p>
 <p>
  This world, which seemed to mock the laws of reality, felt like it was created for the sake of a game. People who were supposed to be dead were suddenly alive and well, healthy lives disappeared without warning, and cause and effect repeated and overlapped.
 </p>
 <p>
  The more I delved into it, the less I understood.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the end, I gave up on pondering it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Regardless of what it is, I’ll return alive.’
 </p>

 <p>
  My course of action remained unchanged.
 </p>
 <p>
  I hurried my steps. The north gate was getting closer.
 </p>
 <p>
  I stopped at the entrance of the village where the desert stretched beyond the horizon.
 </p>
 <p>
  We couldn’t go any further together. An invisible barrier blocked our way.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Will we see each other again?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Before leaving, Priasis said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “On the next floor.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The next floor?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It means we’ll meet again soon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “In that case, I’m relieved.”

  Priasis smiled gently and looked back at us.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m grateful for your help. I won’t give up. I’ll definitely live up to your expectations.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis’s figure faded away beyond the door.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Quest Clear!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★★★)’, ‘Jenna (★★★)’, ‘Eloka (★★★)’, ‘Velkist (★★★)’, ‘Neryssa (★★★)’, Level Up!]

  [Reward – 100,000G]
 </p>
 <p>
  [MVP – ‘Jenna (★★★)’]
 </p>
 <p>

  [A bonus stage will be unlocked.]

  [Limit – 1 opportunity, 1 person only]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is it over?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, it’s over.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The village’s landscape began to be engulfed in light.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna put away her bow and chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There wasn’t anything special this time. I hope the 30th floor is like this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s even more ominous. From my experience, if the front is easy, the back is tough. What do you think?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I agree.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No effort in your response.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The light grew brighter and enveloped us.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I opened my eyes again, it was a familiar place.
 </p>
 <p>
  I immediately disbanded the party.
 </p>
 <p>
  No one was injured, but it was a business trip after a long time. Fatigue must have built up. The members left without saying a word and headed upstairs through the Rift of Time and Space. Of course, I stayed on the 1st floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can’t leave it behind.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★★★)’ suggests.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Request – Complete the bonus stage]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Will you accept?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes (Selected) / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng must have been curious too, as she accepted it right away.
 </p>
 <p>
  I started the strategy for the bonus stage.
 </p>

 <p>
  Only one opportunity. It was a quest for one person.
 </p>
 <p>
  The field was a labyrinth.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were no special rewards for the bonus stage.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just a complex maze with twists and turns. There were no monsters or traps either.
 </p>
 <p>
  I continued to explore, memorizing the structure of the labyrinth one by one.
 </p>
 <p>
  After about an hour, I was able to find the exit.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Bonus Stage Clear!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Reward – 5,000G]
 </p>
 <p>
  There was really nothing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not even the common treasure chest could be seen at the exit of the labyrinth.

 <p>
  ‘Is it a dud?’
 </p>
 <p>
  No, it couldn’t be.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anyway, I had completed all the missions for the 25th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Starting tomorrow, I will continue with the climbing of the 26th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A desert.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It seems that the field won’t change this time.
 </p>
 <p>
  If my prediction was correct, the mission for the 25th floor was just the beginning.
 </p>
 <p>
  As I said before, if it’s easy in the front, it’s tough in the back.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I know this game well.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I laughed and left the Rift of Time and Space.

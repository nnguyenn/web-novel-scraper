  &lt;It’s a joke.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a bad joke for the heart.”

 <p>
  I smirked.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet’s voice continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;The fact that the Master contacted like this…&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, we’re heading to the boss stage soon. Just in case, I’m letting you know in advance.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Does that mean there’s a possibility of an accident?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not entirely impossible.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I had already explained to Yurnet about Townia and its difficulty. Yurnet had strongly opposed my return after hearing the story, but I had managed to persuade her somehow.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Master, if it gets dangerous, don’t hesitate to use the ring.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I don’t plan to use it much though.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Using it during the mission had significant penalties. It consumed three uses at once, and according to Yurnet, summoning weapons also took time. Most importantly, it exposed my identity to Anytng and others. It was an ability that couldn’t be used lightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I won’t use it during the mission.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Unless it’s a life-or-death situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  After making my decision again, I continued speaking.
 </p>
 <p>
  The topic wasn’t anything special. It was about Niflheimr’s current situation and what happened after I returned. I was told that Nihaku, who had returned suddenly after hearing the news, was greatly disappointed. I just laughed it off.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;If the Master allows it, how about assigning Nihaku to Townia…&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “No.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;As expected.&gt;
 </p>

 <p>
  A light chuckle could be heard.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Anyway, Master, please preserve your body. Your life doesn’t belong to just you anymore.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry. I don’t even have the slightest intention of dying. I’ll contact you again later.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;You mustn’t forget. Absolutely not.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “I understand. I’ll let you know as soon as I return. It won’t be as disappointing as last time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;That’s a relief.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned the ring to the right side.
 </p>
 <p>
  The flow of magic that had surrounded my body dispersed.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the desk were several sheets of paper.

  These were preemptive strategies I had written, predicting up to the 30th floor. The leftmost paper categorized three types of missions: Exploration, Subjugation, and Escape.
 </p>
 <p>
  This prediction had a high probability of being correct for ordinary accounts.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was an actual test I had gone through. However, Townia’s missions often exceeded my expectations. The strategies on the left were just for beginners. As you moved to the right, their importance increased. The structure of the maze I had encountered in the bonus stage was recorded.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This map will somehow come into play.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t know in what way, but I had to memorize it.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition, there were comprehensive specs for Party 1, the status of other parties, as well as the situation in the waiting room. hese were all things to keep in mind when planning your strategy.
 </p>
 <p>
  The next evening.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng sent the heroes from the 1st floor who had stolen supplies to the 30th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  I knew the purpose right away.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a selection team to obtain information on the 30th floor.

  They were led by Iselle and were annihilated before they could last even 5 minutes. Even though they died at the beginning, we managed to obtain one clear piece of information about the 30th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Caution!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [This mission requires five parties, a large-scale mission. If you are short of party members, please use paid or free summons to replenish your heroes!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The log from the time they were sent out came to mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t need to investigate the internal situation to know. The 30th floor was Townia’s first large-scale mission. It required five parties. Anytng sent out a selection team of five individuals, and they were completely wiped out.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘In the official climb, we need twenty-five people.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng quickly continued with the plan.
 </p>
 <p>
  The training of the third was almost complete. It was time to nurture the remaining parties.
 </p>
 <p>
  The frequency of parties 4 and 5 being sent out increased dramatically. They roamed the desert fields, steadily increasing their combat proficiency.
 </p>
 <p>
  Outside of battle, preparations were also in order.

  Eloka, who had been practicing formations at the training camp, was suddenly taken to the Magic Hall. The purpose was rapid research. Eloka spent eighteen hours a day solving problems.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t this a bit too much?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can’t help it. It’s necessary.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Currently, Eloka is the only one in Townia’s research department. To properly manage a raid mission, you needed to raise the research level to at least 5. After three days and nights of hard work, Eloka could finally be released.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ding!]

  [Smooth communication is the basis of a party! Heroes who have acquired this function will be able to communicate effectively even when the distance between parties is great, increasing the efficiency of coordinated play.]
 </p>
 <p>
  With the responsiveness research level reaching 5, communication was unlocked.
 </p>
 <p>
  The function’s effect was simple: long-distance communication. This meant that even if parties were far apart, they could still communicate. It was essential for missions in vast fields. While the effect wasn’t significant at lower levels, having it was far better than not. I immediately called Edis and explained the function.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We can talk even if we’re far away?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Think of it as magic. The method is…”
 </p>
 <p>
  It was similar to when we requested things from the Master.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Like this.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis stepped back halfway.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I hear a voice in my head. It’s fascinating.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Give it a try. It might be useful on the 30th floor.”

 <p>
  “Alright.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis closed her eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Can you hear me?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “I hear you clearly. Remember how to use it and inform the other parties.”
 </p>
 <p>
  There were some limitations.
 </p>
 <p>
  First, only the leader of the party could use it. Second, communication within the same party was not allowed. The distance wasn’t too great, at most about 1 km. As the level of communication increased, these limitations would disappear.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’ll be more enhanced when I create items.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Currently, there was no enchanter in the waiting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  I decided to leave it at this point.

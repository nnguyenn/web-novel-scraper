 <p>
  I chuckled bitterly and went down the stairs.
 </p>
 <p>
  As we descended to the lower floor, the group expanded. From 10 to 15, and then to 25. Before I knew it, there was a procession behind me.

 <p>
  “The number of participants is increasing. Are we going to have hundreds of people going out in the end?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka said, sounding exasperated.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I didn’t answer, Eloka widened her eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is it really going to be like that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ll know when the time comes, won’t you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  We arrived at the plaza on the 1st floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  The rift of time and space was already open.
 </p>
 <p>
  Beside it, Iselle fluttered her wings and looked at the heroes.
 </p>
 <p>
  [All of you! You know it just by looking, right? It’s the 30th floor. Don’t take it lightly and fail. Do your best without bothering Han! Han, fighting!”]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle showed me her clenched fist and disappeared in a flash of light.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re quite popular. I’m jealous.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t pay her any attention.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I took a deep breath.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each party was gathering in the plaza for their final preparations. They checked their armor and equipment and made sure they were in top condition. I conveyed the mission’s precautions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come in when you’re done. Isel won’t wait long.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I stepped into the rift of time and space.
 </p>
 <p>
  The 1st party followed, and then the 2nd party.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Climb the tower, save the world!]

  [Main Dungeon: Current Ascent Floor – 29]
 </p>
 <p>
  The heroes entered one by one.
 </p>
 <p>
  I leaned against the wall and fastened my scabbard. The faces of the people were filled with tension.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Everyone, if you stay focused, you can survive.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna said in a firm voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That depends.’
 </p>
 <p>
  No more words were exchanged.
 </p>
 <p>
  Light began to pour out of the rift of time and space. The feeling of being disassembled and familiar at the same time.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I opened my eyes again.
 </p>

 <p>
  ‘A desert.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As expected, from the 21st to the 30th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ten floors were assigned to one field.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sand-mixed wind brushed against my entire body.
 </p>
 <p>
  I pulled my hood down deeply.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This place…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A city? Is it a city?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m not sure.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked around.
 </p>
 <p>
  Square stone buildings stretched out like a checkerboard. However, all the buildings were buried in sand. From the entrance to the windows. White sand filled the buildings from the entrance to the inside.

 <p>
  “It seems quite old.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I touched the wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s heavily weathered. It’s been abandoned for at least a hundred years. I took a sip from my water and muttered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you hear me, answer.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Is that you, Han?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  It was Edis’s voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, it’s Han from the 1st party. Where are you now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Twenty-five of us were summoned, but there’s only the 1st party here.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ve come to a strange city-like place. There’s a lot of sand, and the weather is scorching. How about you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m in the same situation. Let’s meet up first. Come to the city center. You’ll find it even without me explaining.”

 <p>
  A grating noise echoed in my ears.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the expected noise when the communication ended.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are there any other parties?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Yes. This is Raiman from the 4th party.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Tell the 4th party to come here too. Try contacting the others as well. It seems like we can’t reach them due to the distance.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Understood.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  I rubbed my ear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Raiman’s voice cut off.

  ‘All the parties seem to be separated.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Gathering our strength was the top priority.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Cough. Why is there so much sand?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka coughed while waving her hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  The city was constantly battered by sandstorms.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The weather is the worst.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa said as she covered her mouth with a cloth.
 </p>
 <p>
  The members covered their faces and took heat-resistant supplements.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Neryssa, please lead the way to the city center.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sure.”

  “Oh, and try to find Princess Priasis. She might be here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa nodded and disappeared into the sandstorm.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s move too. To the designated location.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The formation was ready.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was in the front, Jenna and Eloka were in the middle, and Velkist was in the rear.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The visibility isn’t great.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, it’s not great.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Be careful of ambushes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I know.”
 </p>
 <p>
  We continued walking.

 <p>
  The mission objective window had not appeared yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no sign of enemies either. Suddenly, Jenna spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m getting anxious. If nothing happens at the beginning like this…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t say unlucky things.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka looked disgusted.
 </p>
 <p>
  I continued walking. The yellow sand obscured our vision.
 </p>
 <p>
  “2nd party, 4th party.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Here.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Listening.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you see a peculiar building in the city center? Gather there.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Beyond the thick sandstorm, the outline of a massive temple could be seen.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was clear from the goddess statue on the rooftop.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We found it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Us too. And we’ve contacted the other parties as well. We’ll relay the message.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Click.
 </p>
 <p>
  I ended the communication. At the same time, I reached for my scabbard.
 </p>
 <p>
  A faint shadow appeared from the nearby building. The shadow jumped down nimbly from under the roof. Someone was carried on its shoulders.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I found Princess Priasis. She collapsed in the middle of the street.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa gently laid Priasis on the ground.
 </p>

 <p>
  I raised my hand. Jenna and Velkist assumed defensive positions.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There’s a possibility of a trap.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I signaled to Eloka.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka’s magical wave passed through Priasis.
 </p>
 <p>
  “She’s the real one.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is she doing here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It looks like she collapsed while overexerting herself…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I took out a potion of vitality and put it in Priasis’s mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis drank it, glugging it down. Her eyelids trembled and then lifted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Han.”

 <p>
  “Did we help you all the way here to just die?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just… to find the key.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this the right place?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m certain. It matches the scenery I saw in my dream. It’s here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I took out a heat-resistant supplement and offered it to her.
 </p>
 <p>
  Freyasis swallowed it with the potion. Her eyelids trembled before finally opening.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Thank you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t thank me yet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  This place, even in the middle of the desert, had particularly harsh conditions. Without thorough preparation, we could quickly become guests of the relentless desert. Priasis bowed her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I’m sorry.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stick close to Jenna. If anything happens, hide immediately.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis nodded and stood in the middle of the group, with Jenna and Velkist protecting her.
 </p>
 <p>
  The formation changed to protect Priasis in the center.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the same time, the mission window appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Floor 30.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Mission Type – Exploration]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Objective – ???]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Special Objective – Survival of NPC ‘Freyasis Al Raguna’]
 </p>
 <p>
  This is it.
 </p>
 <p>
  I clicked my tongue and continued walking.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sandstorm continued to rage.

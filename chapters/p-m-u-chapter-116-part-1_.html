  Mission type: Exploration.
 </p>
 <p>
  So far, everything is going smoothly. However, the main objective was unclear, and there was an additional condition of NPC survival attached. It felt like a typical mission, yet it was strangely twisted.

 <p>
  I brought my hand up to my ear.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s Han from 1st party.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;&lt;I hear you.&gt;&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Edis, did you check the mission window? It should have just popped up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;&lt;I did. It’s an exploration with an escort objective.&gt;&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ve already secured the target. No need to search. Inform the other parties and join us immediately.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;&lt;Understood.&gt;&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Click.
 </p>
 <p>
  The communication was cut off.
 </p>
 <p>
  I brushed the sand off my shoulder and continued walking. The temple, obscured by dust, was getting closer.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s so quiet.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It had been 10 minutes since we were deployed for this mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  Usually, something unexpected would have happened by now. But the city remained eerily silent. There was no sign of the enemy’s shadow.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is getting annoying.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka fluttered her sleeves with an uncomfortable expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sand grains fell from inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just hold on a bit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I mumbled as I glanced behind me.
 </p>

 <p>
  Priasis was walking silently.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you have the exact location of the key? Is that building the right one?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I pointed to the building ahead, shrouded in dust.
 </p>
 <p>
  The outline of the building wavered at the tip of my finger. Priasis concentrated her sight and then spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, that’s the one. The key is inside.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘We’re on the right track.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  The unique feature of this city was that building, and it had a goddess statue attached to the top. It meant that it had some role as an object. I asked a question.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Any other memories? Monsters or traps, anything?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sorry, nothing else comes to mind.”

 <p>
  I closed my mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like there was no more information to get from Priasis.
 </p>
 <p>
  The rest would have to be discovered by opening the lid ourselves.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the path widened, we approached the courtyard.
 </p>
 <p>
  The temple was right in front of us. It must have been a magnificent building originally, but now, covered in sand and weathered, its original grandeur was hard to discern. The building was in ruins.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Han!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked to my side.
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis was waving from the western passage of the square.
 </p>
 <p>
  Behind her, members of the 2nd party were visible. There were no signs of battle. The three new recruits seemed tense, though.
 </p>
 <p>
  Other parties started joining one by one.

 <p>
  The 3rd party from the north gate of the square, the 4th party, and the 5th party from the west gate.
 </p>
 <p>
  A total of twenty-five people. No one had failed the mission so far.
 </p>
 <p>
  I led Priasis to the front of the temple.
 </p>
 <p>
  All the party leaders gathered. Four pairs of eyes focused on us.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Allow me to introduce. This is the escort target for this mission.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nice to meet you, heroes. I am Priasis Al Ragnara.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis stepped forward hesitantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Raiman’s eyebrows shot up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “When you say Al Ragnara, you don’t mean the Al Ragnara of the imperial family, do you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”

 <p>
  “Well, we can discuss that later.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I asked the members of the other parties what they had observed and found, and their answers were consistent. A sand-covered and weathered city with no other unusual features.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is that temple the only thing here?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked up at the building in front.
 </p>
 <p>
  Columns lined the stairs on both sides. Beyond them, a massive marble door was visible. Everyone’s attention turned to the door.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems to be in there.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I agree.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I spoke up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “1st party will enter first. The rest of you wait outside the temple.”
 </p>

  “Are you sure? We don’t know what might come out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll contact you immediately. There could be something happening outside as well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  We set up a boundary zone between the parties and then dispersed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Except for the 1st party, which was infiltrating, the rest of the parties are in charge of the East, West, South, and North respectively.
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa had already returned.
 </p>
 <p>
  I led the members of the 1st party and approached the temple.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our formation was a circle with Priasis and Eloka in the center.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There don’t seem to be any traps.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa, who had been examining the door, said.
 </p>
 <p>
  I nodded and pushed open the door.

 <p>
  Creak. With an old sound, the temple revealed its interior.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sand trickled down from the temple’s ceiling crack.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There, that’s it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis pointed to the altar.
 </p>
 <p>
  On a small square altar, a small object was floating and emitting light.
 </p>
 <p>
  “A dagger?”
 </p>
 <p>
  It was embedded in a golden scabbard with intricate patterns engraved on it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis approached as if entranced. We followed suit.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s strange. There’s still no sign of enemies.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They practically left it here for us to take.”
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-12" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  I chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t a sinister maze, and there were no giant monsters in sight.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our target was right in front of us as soon as we entered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If we take that, is it over?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems too simple, doesn’t it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, it’s not necessarily a bad thing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis reached out for the dagger on the altar.
 </p>
 <p>
  I put my hand on the scabbard, ready to draw it at any moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then…
 </p>
 <p>
  [First objective achieved.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Key of The Void’ obtained!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis gripped the dagger.
 </p>
 <p>
  Simultaneously, the light on the altar disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is it? Nothing happened…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  The entire temple shook violently.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Warning!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…It seems like it’s happening.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Han!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is it?”

  I disconnected the communication and said, “Priasis, are you okay?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m fine. No problems at all. I can move.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re getting out of here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  Once again,
 </p>
 <p>
  Sand fell heavily from the ceiling.
 </p>
 <p>
  I pushed open the door. We immediately exited the temple.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ku-gu-gu-gu-gung!

 <p>
  The ground beneath our feet shook violently.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Looks like an earthquake!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I know.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I surveyed the square.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was clear at a glance that something had happened.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The sandstorm.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Just five minutes ago, the entire city was engulfed in a sandstorm, but now it had disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Under the scorching sun, with heat radiating down.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then…
 </p>
 <p>
  Ku-gu-gu-gu-gu-gung!

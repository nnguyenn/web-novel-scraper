  “‘Annan (★★★)’ is in a bleeding state. Health decreases at regular intervals.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “‘Gilbert (★★★)’ has returned to the goddess’s embrace! His valor will be remembered forever.”

 <p>
  ‘They already reached their limit.’
 </p>
 <p>
  One person died.
 </p>
 <p>
  The other one was injured.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilbert seemed to have lasted longer than expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The flames accelerated as they spread.
 </p>
 <p>
  The flames, stretching dozens of meters, crackled and spewed flames and smoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They made it damn tough.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Ping! Ping! Ping!
 </p>
 <p>
  Three arrows pierced a lizardman’s torso simultaneously.
 </p>
 <p>
  I swung my sword as three upper bodies caught in the path of my blade splattered blood and organs into the air. I moved forward again. Beyond that, the goddess statue, half buried in the sand, emitted a faint light.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Priasis, just follow me. The rest of you, help the other parties.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you sure it’s okay?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s fine.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist and Eloka left.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not far away, the 4th and 5th parties were approaching, followed by hundreds of lizardmen. Jenna and Neryssa headed in the direction of the 2nd party.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you planning to do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huge monsters are my specialty.”

 <p>
  I had more than just one bad encounter in Niflheim.
 </p>
 <p>
  Quack!
 </p>
 <p>
  A lizardman with a torn face flew away.
 </p>
 <p>
  I corrected my sword and stopped walking. The statue was right in front of me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Beside me, Priasis was panting heavily.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kigigigik.
 </p>
 <p>
  A distinct mechanical sound echoed.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the sound of the monster raising its arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The angle is right. The position is set.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I felt a pressure pressing against my body.

 <p>
  I raised my head, and the statue’s fist was descending, partially obscuring the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took a deep breath and hoisted Priasis up beside me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You need to practice running.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She was light.
 </p>
 <p>
  I must be stronger.
 </p>
 <p>
  I put power into my feet and ran forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Monster Wave!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Round 13.]

 </p>
 <p>
  ‘How many have piled up?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I glanced to the side briefly.
 </p>
 <p>
  We passed hundreds of them.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were swarming like ants.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s getting tight.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It didn’t seem like a mission designed based on the One Try assumption. There was a way, but it was difficult to figure it out without having your first party getting wiped out. It was a characteristic of high-difficulty missions.
 </p>
 <p>
  I soared like a dive.

  The thunderous fist descended again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  I rolled on the floor as I pulled Priasis, who was screaming, close to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Object effect activated!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The power of the goddess envelops the ancient statue!]
 </p>
 <p>
  A dazzling light poured out from where the goddess statue had been.
 </p>
 <p>
  The light extended into the air like spider silk and began to climb up the arm of the statue.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gee-ing.
 </p>
 <p>
  The statue froze in the same posture as its arm descended.
 </p>
 <p>
  The angle of the arm embedded in the ground was between 35 and 40 degrees.

 <p>
  Not perfect, but sufficient.
 </p>
 <p>
  I opened the channel.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re going up on this thing, now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;…&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t dawdle. We don’t have time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I disconnected the communication and gathered the 1st party.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is quite… unusual.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can’t you do something simple, just once?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, you’re not going?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist smiled and lowered his bloodstained sword.

 <p>
  “So we’re playing horse?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The flames had already covered half of the field.
 </p>
 <p>
  The rear lizardmen were engulfed in flames, becoming ashes. The heroes surrounded the statue’s fist, blocking the monsters.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who’s going first?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Naha, of course, it’s us!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Quack!
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha, who had smashed the heads of three lizardmen in a row, leaped and spun in mid-air. The agile newcomer landed gracefully on the giant palm. Other beastfolk also emerged and climbed up the forearm.
 </p>
 <p>
  Next was the 1st party.
 </p>
 <p>
  I pushed the ground hard and leaped. After grabbing the protruding rock with my left hand, I leaped again. The sensation of the hard stone floor touched my feet. When I looked back, other members were also climbing up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kiaak! Karruuuuuur! Karruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuk!”
 </p>

 <p>
  Hundreds of lizardmen surrounded us and advanced.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Inferio! Rise!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka, standing on the statue, raised her hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  The flames, drawing a circle, blocked the path of the lizardmen. Without hesitation, numerous lizardmen jumped and became ashes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hurry up!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna lowered her posture, assuming a shooting stance. Dozens of arrows rained down on the lizardmen like rain. The flames of the field had now moved within 10 meters. Everyone was climbing the steep cliff frantically.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis reached out, and Edis helped her climb up.
 </p>
 <p>
  All 23 members had boarded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Below, the lizardmen engulfed in flames were roaring.
 </p>
 <p>
  Goo-ooo-ooo-ooo.
 </p>
 <p>
  A groaning sound was heard.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thunk! The fixed arm shook greatly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now, what do we do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis turned to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her forehead was wet with blood and sweat, with hair sticking to it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I told you. We’re going up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I pointed to the head of the monster on the other side of the arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although giant, his comically shaped face was looking in our direction. The angle of the embedded arm was 35 degrees. The forearm of the monster, which was more than 30 meters in width and over 150 meters in length, resembled a giant leg.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Going up…?!”
 </p>

  “We have to destroy it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thunk!
 </p>
 <p>
  The ground shook once more.
 </p>
 <p>
  The light surrounding the arm became hazy.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Warning!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The ‘Self-Defense System’ of the statue is activated.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Ching-ching. Grrick-grrick.
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, a ballista popped out from the side of the arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kruuk, kill the intruders!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lids were opening everywhere, revealing lizardmen.
 </p>

 <p>
  Lizardmen armored with scales were descending in rows.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  With a heavy sound, the crossbows fired arrows.
 </p>
 <p>
  I fixed my feet to the ground and gathered strength in my shoulders. Quack! The impact on my arm was strong. The split arrow lost its momentum and fell.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kiaaak!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The lizardman at the forefront roared.
 </p>
 <p>
  I adjusted my sword and said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you all see that? This bastard’s insides are empty. Let’s smash it from the inside.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, what about the ballista…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that important? Hurry. Finish it before it pulls its arm out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The lid opened right in front of us.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was about to come to meet you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I swept the lizardman’s head, which was about to pop out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Woosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  With a bone-cracking sound, the lizardman’s neck snapped and broke in the opposite direction.
 </p>
 <p>
  The limp body suddenly got sucked in. Just as the square slab was about to close, I slid in and jammed my sword between the gaps.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kaeng!”
 </p>
 <p>
  When I threw the dagger into the hole, a small scream was heard.
 </p>
 <p>
  I kicked the lid up with my heel. A black hole was revealed.

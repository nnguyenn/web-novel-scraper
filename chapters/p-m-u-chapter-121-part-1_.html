 <p>
  Fierce steam erupted from various places.
 </p>
 <p>
  The corridor vibrated, and the wall collapsed, revealing gears and wires inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Danger!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The damage to the ‘Ancient Statue’ is severe!]
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;I think we’ve reached a dead end! It seems like there’s no way forward anymore.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Climb the stairs, then go right. If you go straight to the three-way intersection, you’ll find the exit. Get ready to leave once you’re there.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;What are you going to do?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll break through the head and make our escape.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;You’re really pushing your luck, warrior!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Ziing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha’s voice disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  I dashed through the corridor, where the red light and fluorescent tubes flashed together.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oppa, I think something’s coming from behind!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned to Jenna’s voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clank, clank, clank. Something massive was approaching in the dark corridor, shaking the ceiling and walls.
 </p>
 <p>
  [XYZ Ultimate Golem Lv.46]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Karrk! Karararara! Don’t underestimate my invention!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It looks like the door has been broken.”

 <p>
  The golem extended its hand as it approached.
 </p>
 <p>
  The aiming device on the repeating crossbow began to spin rapidly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Tudududududung!
 </p>
 <p>
  With a somewhat sharp sound, bolts shot out from its hand. Velkist, who had been following behind, swung his sword. Splintered wood and arrowheads scattered in all directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll handle this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you talking about? If we’re going to fight, we should all fight together.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “‘Venik (★★★)’ is in a bleeding state. Health decreases at regular intervals.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Han! Suddenly, a large number of enemies are swarming us!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis’s desperate voice echoed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How many?”

  &lt;There are over 100. We’re trying to break through and head to the exit…&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it. Hold on a little longer. Don’t let Priasis die.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;I’ll do my best.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The communication was cut off.
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa, who had been looking at me, smiled lightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka stopped as if waiting.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Three is enough. You two should go ahead.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t you trust us?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally, Jenna nodded and patted her cheek.

 <p>
  “This is nothing to worry about.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you think it’s no longer possible, run away immediately. I hope I’m being clear.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned and ran again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna followed behind me. A moment later, the sound of intense battle came from behind.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Will they be okay?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you think those guys trained for nothing? Have a little faith.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I increased my speed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The corridor was narrow. Moving with more than three people would only be a hindrance.
 </p>
 <p>
  To tell the truth, the outcome is unknown. The result may be that those guys lose. If so, three death messages will appear before me

  [Elite Lizardman Warrior Lv. 32]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Karrrruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuk!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The door next to the corridor opened with a creak, and a lizardman rushed out.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was wearing sturdy plate armor and held a dazzlingly shining sword in his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ping!
 </p>
 <p>
  An arrow accurately pierced a gap in his armor like a needle.
 </p>
 <p>
  I drew my dagger and thrust it into the lizardman’s helmet, which resounded with a scream of pain. When I withdrew the hilt, he spurted blood and collapsed.

 <p>
  I continued running through the corridor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lizardmen appeared several times, but we dealt with them all as we kept moving forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  [“Velkist (★★★)” is in a bleeding state. Health decreases at regular intervals.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [“Roza (★★)” has returned to the embrace of the goddess! Her courage will be remembered forever.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s really annoying.”
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how difficult Pick Me Up was said to be, this was beyond hard.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clearing the stage seemed to be a difficulty that the developers didn’t want.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘My account was somewhat similar.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I thought of the heroes of Niflheimr, who had suffered several times.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially Seris. She must have felt similar to me now. A smile involuntarily appeared on my lips.

  “Oppa.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry. We’ll definitely clear it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I continued forward, dispatching the lizardmen blocking the way.
 </p>
 <p>
  The blade of Bifrost stained crimson. After crossing two sections and climbing numerous stairs, I finally reached the last room.
 </p>
 <p>
  All sorts of wires were gathered here.
 </p>
 <p>
  A thick iron door was firmly closed as if denying entry.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Karrk! Foolish humans, you’ve finally made it here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I heard a voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you know what the woman you’re protecting is trying to do? She’s defying the order of the universe!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you talking about?”
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  I forcefully kicked the door.
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside a circular room several meters in size, with large monitors extending in all directions, a small lizardman in robes was staring at me. The lenses of his compound eyes reflected light.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master of Arcane, Kurushakh Lv.35]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kiaak, human! You’ve made a mistake…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I took out a poisoned dagger from my belt and threw it.
 </p>
 <p>
  The purple blade pierced through his robe and into his abdomen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then three arrows pierced his nose, throat, and heart precisely.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kkuuh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thunk.
 </p>
 <p>
  He vomited black blood and collapsed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instant death. I checked the surroundings. There was another door on the right side of the wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Destroy all these suspicious devices. Leave nothing behind.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I opened the door and entered.
 </p>
 <p>
  The entire room was filled with octagonal crystals.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack! Thud! Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  The sound of impacts spread from outside the open door.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like Jenna was smashing the devices with enthusiasm.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is the last one.’

 <p>
  I looked down at my feet.
 </p>
 <p>
  The black blood that the lizardman had spilled was stuck to my boots. If I had the time, I would have listened to what he was saying, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  I gripped the hilt with both hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I plunged the sword into the crystal, gold spread like a spider’s web. I twisted it and pulled it out. Crunch! Shattered pieces of the crystal scattered in all directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kugugugugung!
 </p>
 <p>
  [Danger!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The ‘Ancient Statue’ has reached its limit.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s collapsing!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The entire room began to shake.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Mission type has changed.]

 </p>
 <p>
  I went outside.
 </p>
 <p>
  As it shook, Jenna was diligently smashing machine parts with her bow.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jenna!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, Oppa!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This place is about to collapse. We need to get out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What about the others?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll meet them on the way out. Follow me!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna jumped up and joined me.
 </p>
 <p>
  We immediately left the room. The vibrations intensified.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kugugugug. Rocks were falling from the ceiling.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We just took care of the last crystal. The entrance should be open now. The flames outside should have disappeared. Go out right away.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;I’ve confirmed the door! I’ll take Priasis with me. What about you?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re fine here. We’ll manage.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as I cut off the communication, I jumped to the side.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sharp rock fragments fell where I had been standing. I ran after that. Lizardmen were scurrying around in various places in the corridor. I ignored them.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Where is it?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I recalled the map of the bonus stage.
 </p>
 <p>
  I calculated the fastest way to escape after joining the other three.
 </p>
 <p>
  Left, right. Then right again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kwakwakwakwakwung!
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  A powerful explosion sounded from a side corridor.
 </p>
 <p>
  I immediately moved. In the smoke, a human figure appeared. Jenna’s eyes gleamed as she dived into the smoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Over here!”
 </p>
 <p>
  In the smoke, the three of them revealed themselves.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Slower than expected. We’ve been waiting.”

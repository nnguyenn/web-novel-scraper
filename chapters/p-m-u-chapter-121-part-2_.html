  “Over here!”
 </p>
 <p>
  In the smoke, the three of them revealed themselves.

 <p>
  “Slower than expected. We’ve been waiting.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist spat out a mouthful of blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  Half of his face was covered in blood. Neryssa and Eloka weren’t unscathed either. They had numerous minor wounds apparent between their torn clothes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What about that machine?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It stopped on its own the moment I was about to finish it. Was it the senior’s doing?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I only destroyed the crystal. Anyway, this place is about to collapse. Follow me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist oddly changed his stride.
 </p>
 <p>
  I glanced down. Velkist’s right leg, which had been deeply cut, had bone exposed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry about it and keep going. It’s not a big deal, I can…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thunk!
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist collapsed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa was holding a knife sheath behind him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t be stubborn for no reason.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa lifted the unconscious Velkist.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll carry him. Let’s go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I nodded and started running again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shhiiiing! The wall split open, and steam gushed out. We went around it.
 </p>

 <p>
  In the next corridor, an explosion occurred. We descended through the collapsed floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The path has become quite twisted.”
 </p>
 <p>
  There were many impassable routes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Without memorizing the map, we might have wandered and been lost.
 </p>
 <p>
  We descended to the lower floor, took the stairs, and opened the emergency exit door. The fierce sandstorm struck our faces. We were outside. Then we exited through the outdoor passage.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked up.
 </p>
 <p>
  The statue was twisting and groaning all over its body.
 </p>
 <p>
  Its parts were gradually cracking and collapsing.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked down.
 </p>

 <p>
  The flames that covered the ground had disappeared. Below, about ten survivors, including Priasis, were moving away in a line like ants.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How are we going to get down? It’s too high!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sis, can’t you use telekinesis?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not all-powerful to that extent!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whiiiiiing!
 </p>
 <p>
  A strong wind blew.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked back and extended my hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Neryssa, the rope!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I received the coiled rope.
 </p>
 <p>
  A specially made high-strength rope. It was nearly 100 meters long.
 </p>

 <p>
  I looped it like a noose and held it in my left hand. There was no time. If we didn’t maintain our balance right now, we wouldn’t have a chance.
 </p>
 <p>
  I pressed my back against the statue’s thigh.
 </p>
 <p>
  My body began to descend along the slope. When my body was about to bounce off after passing the thigh, I hooked the noose of the rope onto the protruding part of my knee. I fixed the rope, shaking it left and right while kicking the wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Slide down!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nel, sis, go first!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa, who had tied Velkist to her back, descended.
 </p>
 <p>
  She safely latched onto the rope. Then Eloka, and finally Jenna.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were no dropouts.
 </p>
 <p>
  I pulled up my leather gloves and descended quickly on the rope.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, a group of lizardmen fell to the ground from the sky.

 <p>
  The ground was getting closer.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack! The lizardmen’s bodies left red marks on the sandy ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  Next to it, I landed. After waiting for the four of them, I looked up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom! Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  Explosions were happening all over the statue’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s still dangerous! Run!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Rocks fell from the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  We ran through the sand. On the side, Anytng was shaking a fluorescent tube.
 </p>
 <p>
  After about three minutes of running.
 </p>
 <p>
  We reached a small sand dune.
 </p>

 <p>
  Next to it, the others who had arrived earlier were taking a break.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a somewhat pathetic sound, the 300-meter giant collapsed all at once.
 </p>
 <p>
  What remained was a rugged mountain entangled with sand and rocks.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aaah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka collapsed on the sand.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stage Clear!]

 <p>
  “It’s finally over somehow.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa gently placed Velkist on the ground and spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  The light began to envelop the field’s end. Dazzling particles ascended into the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good job, Han.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I accepted the canteen offered by Edis.

 <p>
  While drinking water, I asked, “How’s everyone’s condition?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No need to worry. It’s alright. A few people died, but…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis’ voice trailed off.
 </p>
 <p>
  We expected casualties within the expected range.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kahaha! But you, you’re amazing! What have you been up to? It’s been a while since I felt so alive!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Raiman, who stood leaning on his greatsword, laughed heartily.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lycan laughed along.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You did good too, even though you’re old!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Old? I’m still in my prime!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The voices of the heroes grew louder.
 </p>
 <p>
  Amidst all this, there was one person standing awkwardly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t know how many died because of me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis had a dark expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If collecting the keys is connected to the crisis… Augh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis clutched her forehead and stepped back.
 </p>
 <p>
  I struck her forehead sharply.
 </p>
 <p>
  “W-What are you doing!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you even questioning now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t know it’s complicated…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t think too much if it’s complicated. That’s better.”

  The light enveloped the entire field.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Maybe you’re right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thunk.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I opened my eyes, a familiar place appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Three mirrors and a circular room. It was the rift of time and space.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll see you again.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I heard that there are three keys.
 </p>
 <p>
  We’ve only gathered one. It’s going to be a tough journey ahead.
 </p>
 <p>
  I forced a bitter smile and left the rift of time and space.

  A sensation like I’ve experienced it somewhere before.

  Iselle was flying toward me with a bright expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Amazing as always. Truly the King God Emperor Majesty!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t make so much noise. It’s loud in my ears.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [To the great Loki, a gift from the Master!]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No way.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle extended an item she was holding in her arms.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Gifting ‘Warhorse Statue’ to ‘Han(★★★)’!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I accepted the statue.
 </p>
 <p>
  How many times is this now?
 </p>
 <p>
  I have to admit it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I lost.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han(★★★)’ is pleased to receive the ‘Warhorse Statue.’]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Affection level increased!]

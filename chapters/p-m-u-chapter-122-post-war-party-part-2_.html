  [So this is supposed to be a 1-star? Are you kidding me? If this guy is a 1-star, I’ll cut off my chili.]
 </p>
 <p>
  └&lt;KimochiDesuYo&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  [It seems like he’s really a 1-star hero. If you search for this user’s past posts, he posted a question before. At that time, this hero was also there. It was 2 stars back then, but looking at the stats, it was like a 3-star. Even if you say otherwise, it’s at least a 2-star.]

 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s much stronger than its level and star rating, but more than that, the sense of the walkthrough is more impressive. It seems innate. Sometimes there are guys like that. Like Loki’s Seris, isn’t it?]
 </p>
 <p>
  └&lt;SerisJang&gt;

  [He’s crazy… Seriously… Why is my hero not like this?]

  &lt;Signal&gt;

 <p>
  [Don’t believe this liar. 1-star heroes are not like this.]

 <p>
  [No.]

  [This game is a good example of why this game is all about f*cking luck. If you pick a good hero, it’ll clear itself just by shaking a fluorescent tube in the back. Everyone quit this trash game. I’m quitting too.]
 </p>
 <p>
  └&lt;MoneyInHandGiveMe&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  [The person above is a friend of mine, and he’s good at the game. He says he puts in 100,000 won every month.]
 </p>
 <p>
  I scrolled down silently.
 </p>
 <p>
  Most reactions were similar to what I had seen before.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, it makes sense.’

  When I uploaded the Niflheimr walkthrough videos, they had similar content.
 </p>
 <p>
  [They say this game is fun, so I wanted to try it. The video is good. The action is cool. But is it supposed to be this difficult originally?]
 </p>
 <p>
  └&lt;Astari&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  [I think the video is exaggerated. It’s not usually this difficult. It’s enjoyable on the lower floors. The upper floors are hell, though.]
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;PolicemanChungCheongWindow&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  [The difficulty is carcinogenic. It’s the 30th floor, and a giant monster appears? The pattern is really complex. Although this hero carried him, I won’t be surprised if his whole party gets wiped soon.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [If I show this video to the idiots in my waiting room, will they get better. Can I know how you raised your hero? Are you following Loki’s strategy?]
 </p>
 <p>
  └&lt;Anytng(Writer)&gt;

  [I did give a little gift of a military horse statue. He really liked it.]

 <p>
  I never liked it.

  &lt;Larmina&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  [Haak! What a video! This hero is totally my type. Please upload more videos! Pressing the recommendation button and going.]
 </p>
 <p>
  With each refresh, new comments were added.
 </p>
 <p>
  They asked about how he raised the hero.
 </p>
 <p>
  They demanded detailed specs of the hero.
 </p>
 <p>
  They requested other videos.

 <p>
  It was a repetition of the same pattern.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were quite a few offbeat comments too.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hail to Loki!]
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;MoonlightInMyArms&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  [I heard there’s a hero who overwhelmingly ranked first among the Niflheimr trainees, isn’t it him?]
 </p>
 <p>
  └&lt;Sigine&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  [If he ranked first, Loki would have taken him. But be careful when uploading such videos. Strange messages can be troublesome. Be cautious. Don’t accept strange messages.]
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no need to see more.
 </p>
 <p>
  I closed the window. Iselle was beaming.
 </p>
 <p>
  [How’s that, Loki? You’re a star from now on. After being the master of masters, you’re now a star hero too!]

  “That’s really pleasing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Isn’t it?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The play count on YouTube had already surpassed 50,000.
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering the buzz, reaching 100,000 wouldn’t be difficult.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sat back and crossed my legs.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There’s still some risk.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In fact, making a name for oneself in Pick Me Up had many drawbacks.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially if the goal was a simple tower strategy.
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  But there was a reason why I couldn’t blame Anytng.

  [Package Contents – For 30 days, we will give you 150 gems and 10,000 gold every day. (4,500 gems + 300,000 gold) Amazing special offer!]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘All of this for only 50,000 won!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng didn’t hesitate and made the payment.
 </p>
 <p>
  The gem count at the top increased.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Maybe from YouTube earnings.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Before becoming a ranker, when there was no steady source of gems, I used to utilize this method too.
 </p>
 <p>
  Upload a strategy video, earn ad revenue, use it for in-app purchases, and then upload another video.

  If you didn’t have much disposable income, it was a good way to escape the pressure of spending.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was also recorded in the strategy document. So he probably followed the instructions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Or not.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Perhaps he just wanted to show off.’
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master, there are 3 unread messages!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Messages sent from other masters. Will you check them?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes / No (Choose)]
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng closed the alert.
 </p>
 <p>
  The account name had already been exposed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, if it’s just messages, it can be ignored.
 </p>
 <p>
  If there’s nothing special in the content, and as long as it doesn’t give away coordinates, there’s no risk of harm.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Loki… Is something bothering you?]
 </p>
 <p>
  While I was lost in thought, Iselle was keeping an eye on me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your expression seems stiff.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s nothing. I enjoyed it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I stood up from the chair.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having a name has its downsides.
 </p>
 <p>
  But it also has quite a few advantages.
 </p>
 <p>
  Things got interesting.

  ‘For now, he’s an outstanding rookie.’
 </p>
 <p>
  His main hero is quite a standout talent for a 1-star hero.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, he’s nothing more than a level 30 noob. The real rankers in Pick Me Up probably won’t pay much attention. Unless it’s a user with discerning eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  I continued my thoughts and burst into laughter.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was amusing that I was evaluating myself. Despite claiming to pursue objectivity, when it comes to self-evaluation, one tends to be biased, don’t they?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Iselle.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yeah?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let me know when the next video goes up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Oh, sure! I’ll definitely call you!]
 </p>
 <p>
  I laughed and left the training ground.

  The party was still going on in the square.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re late, Hyung! What’s the matter?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nothing. Just a trivial story.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehehe, tell us! I really want to have a drink with you, hyung.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Reddening, Raiman extended a beer mug.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was already filled with golden liquid.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I usually don’t drink.’
 </p>
 <p>
  But it wouldn’t hurt to indulge once in a while.
 </p>
 <p>
  Tomorrow, the tight schedule begins again.
 </p>
 <p>
  I accepted the drink.

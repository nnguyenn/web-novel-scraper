  In Pick Me Up, every 10 floors numerous contents are unlocked.
 </p>
 <p>
  Essentially, new areas open up in the exploration dungeon, facility restrictions are lifted, and the hero’s level cap increases. Several features were added in this manner.

 <p>
  [Master, congratulations on clearing floor 30!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You are now an esteemed Master. Who would dare to dismiss you as a novice? Please continue to work hard in the future!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [A new weekday dungeon has been opened.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The third exploration dungeon, ‘Kaia,’ is now open.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Additional facilities have been unlocked. Please check the help section.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The sector of the ‘Lobby’ Townia is changing.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Affiliated sector: 95513 -&gt; 88347]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Current coordinates – 188.347.447.935]
 </p>
 <p>
  [From Grade 8 sectors, ‘Ruins’ will appear!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tips/Ruins provide jewels and various rare items. Jewels can be exchanged for a certain amount of gems.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Every 10 floors, the Master’s area or sector changes.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was a method to balance and ensure that low-level and high-level players don’t encounter each other in the same area.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, new content is also created with each ascent. For instance, on the 30th floor, you can send a party to explore ruins on airship to obtain rewards.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If there’s an airship.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s not possible for the time being.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s  challenging to create. Numerous materials, a high research level, and airship technicians, along with significant required funds and production time, not to mention the need for a 4-star Mage to operate it properly. As a newly graduated Master, Anytng, tackling airships was still beyond reach.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the end,

  The situation wasn’t much different from before opening the dimensional rift.
 </p>
 <p>
  Regrettable.
 </p>
 <p>
  If there were an airship, it could play a significant role in missions and supply gems in the ruins.
 </p>
 <p>
  Smooth interaction with other Masters was also possible. The gameplay before and after acquiring an airship was different, like in other games.

  Subsequently, Anytng entered the Dimensional Cafe from the right side of the screen.

 <p>
  [Want to explore? We specialize in renting out large, medium, and small airships! For detailed inquiries, please contact. KakaoTalk ID is……]
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng started looking into posts about rental airships in the Dimensional Cafe.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, there were probably no suitable conditions. The rental fee was excessively high, and in case of damage, all losses had to be compensated. Moreover, without a guarantee, they wouldn’t lend it. And without a Mage to operate it, the burden became even more severe.
 </p>

  In the end, Anytng closed the window.

 <p>
  The sky darkened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Senior, what are you staring at?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked back.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist was wiping the sweat off his forehead with a towel.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I thought you’d at least join in after all this time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist tossed the used towel into the basket.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were only two of us in the training ground. After clearing the 30th floor, we were taking a short break today. Except for heroes like Velkist who loved training, the rest didn’t show up at the training ground.

  ‘Airships.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s good if there is, but it’s not a problem if there isn’t.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no need to rush. Naturally, as we climbed the tower, we would acquire it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shall we go?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I got up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Resting his hand on the hilt of his sword, Velkist stood in the middle of the training ground as if waiting.

  It seems like he left without checking this.

  Anytng consistently ignored channel chats as well as all messages.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I understand, but it’s a bit much.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I stopped in my tracks.
 </p>
 <p>
  The options demanding a response were flashing blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you trying to annoy me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shush, don’t make a fuss.”

  I sighed and stepped onto the training ground.

  And that dawn.

  I summoned Iselle to the room.
 </p>
 <p>
  [What’s going on?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle came wearing pajamas and a beanie.
 </p>
 <p>
  In her arms, she held a long pillow with ‘Ragnaroki’ written on it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘….’
 </p>
 <p>
  I decided to get to the point.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Iselle, I want temporary Master authority.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Huh? Authority?]
 </p>
 <p>
  I nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just want to check some messages from others.”

 <p>
  If not, I wouldn’t have been able to create items.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Okay, if it’s Loki’s request!]
 </p>
 <p>
  As Iselle turned around, her pajamas and hat disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle, back in her original attire, looked determined.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Haat! Fairy Power!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  The light emitted from Iselle’s hand seeped into me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Verification complete. It might be challenging to perform essential tasks like synthesis or summoning, but this should be enough.

  The fact that channel chat is possible means this person is a neighbor located in the same sector as Anytng.

  Anytng&gt; Yes.

  “Iselle, show me the map of the current sector.”

  A checkerboard-style map unfolded with a small tower at the center.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I slid the screen with my left hand, another tower, marked in gray, appeared. It was another Master’s waiting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Gray.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s straightforward.

  A long-term inactive user.

 <p>
  In other words, they logged out.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The number of masters assigned to one sector is 100.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking around here and there, all of them are gray.
 </p>
 <p>
  I smirked.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sinunoo&gt; Since there’s almost no one here, it’s so lonely.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sinunoo&gt; I hope Anytng-nim won’t log out. I wanted to talk because I want a bit of help.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sinunoo&gt; I do a lot of farming, so I have quite a few spare materials.
 </p>
 <p>
  Oh my.
 </p>
 <p>
  They got straight to the point.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sinunoo&gt; I’d like to know your coordinates. I’ll come by right away if you tell me. Check it on the menu on the right. Just let me know.

  I turned the chair’s wheels.

  Iselle had a serious expression.

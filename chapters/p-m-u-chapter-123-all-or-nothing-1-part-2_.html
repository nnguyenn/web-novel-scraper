 <p>
  Anytng&gt; Hold on a moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned the chair’s wheels.

 <p>
  Iselle had a serious expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This guy…]
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “You can tell just by looking.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I muttered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “A hunter.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In other words, a sucker hunter.
 </p>
 <p>
  Acting helpful, they ask for the coordinates and then strip the user clean.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some people who don’t play a lot of games surprisingly falls for it easily.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If there are many gray accounts nearby.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It seems like he has already taken what they could.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though the tone seemed friendly, it’s clearly an act.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ignore such guys! It’s not worth responding to.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle exhaled and turned her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “….”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Loki?]
 </p>
 <p>
  I checked the sector’s map again.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ratio of logged-out users is quite high. There are non-gray accounts, but the colors are fading.

 <p>
  Masters who log in irregularly. There’s a term for calling places like this that aren’t in a good situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A bad sector.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, there are genuinely kind Masters who want to help others.
 </p>
 <p>
  If assigned to sectors with many such people, you can grow under full support. Though it doesn’t seem like here.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sinunoo&gt; Hey there?
 </p>
 <p>
  Sinunoo&gt; Reply ^^:
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng&gt; Hold on.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Why bother responding? Can you tell me?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait. I’m thinking.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I revisited the rules for PVP.

  If you know the dimensional coordinates, invasion through airships becomes possible. However, that doesn’t mean you’re unconditionally protected if you don’t reveal them. Eventually, they’ll be uncovered.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I took a file from the drawer.
 </p>
 <p>
  It contained information on PVP users, hunters, and their methods.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hunting on the 30th floor.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A rare category.
 </p>
 <p>
  Getting airships on the 30th floor is not easy. If it happens, it’s due to one of three things: exceptionally good luck, heavy spending, or having a reliable high-level backer.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Either way, it’s annoying.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Sinunoo&gt; It’s awkward if you keep ignoring me….
 </p>
 <p>
  Sinunoo&gt; I really want to meet you. Even if you don’t tell me, I’ll find you soon ^^;

  This bastard.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bold.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng&gt; I’m sorry. I heard the warning about being cautious.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sinunoo&gt; You worry a lot keke.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng&gt; It cool to have an airship, I want one too. What should I do?
 </p>
 <p>
  Sinunoo&gt; Planning is a bit tricky, right? I have a few blueprints. Should I send them?
 </p>
 <p>
  [Loki, seriously…?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “When this chat ends, delete the logs.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Wait, isn’t it better to decide when the Master is present? The master is not here…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s better that way.”

  I looked at the index finger of my left hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They will come here anyway.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s better now than getting backstabbed later.
 </p>
 <p>
  I pressed Enter.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng&gt; I looked at the coordinates, but I don’t really know what’s what.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sinunoo&gt; Just tell me the last six digits~
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng&gt; Ah, it says 447,935.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sinunoo&gt; So, Anytng’s coordinates are 188.347.447.935!
 </p>
 <p>
  Sinunoo&gt; You said you want blueprints. I’ll send three small ones. Basic materials too.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng&gt; Thank you!

 <p>
  [Master ‘Sinunoo’ has ended the chat.]
 </p>
 <p>
  I clicked the ‘X’ at the top.
 </p>
 <p>
  The channel chat window closed. Iselle was looking at me with wide eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  [What will we do!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s okay.”
 </p>
 <p>
  There are cases where Masters get attacked when they’re absent.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that time, the hero automatically defends. There shouldn’t be any suspicion.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It reminds me of the old days.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled.

  In Pick Me Up, many Masters who diligently carried out missions often ended up frustrated. They usually fell into two categories. The first group gave up climbing altogether and enjoyed SimCity. The second group became professional hunters specializing in PVP.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once they start, they can’t forget that thrill.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was only one way to deal with it.
 </p>
 <p>
  I got up from the chair.
 </p>
 <p>
  The current time is 11:43 PM.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I have about an hour.’
 </p>
 <p>
  “Iselle, I’ll leave it to you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [But…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Clank.

  I hooked the sheath onto my belt.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve never lost in a one-on-one fight.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I opened the door and left.
 </p>
 <p>
  The reception room of the 1st party’s dormitory is empty.
 </p>
 <p>
  After turning on the lantern, I raised the bell placed on the table and shook it.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a bell made for emergency calls.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s this? Why all of a sudden…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the corridor door opened, Jenna walked out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Next to her, Neryssa and Eloka also revealed themselves.
 </p>
 <p>
  All three had puzzled expressions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They’re coming. Get ready.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What nonsense are you talking about? Did you eat something weird?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…An invasion.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa’s eyes sank.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s good that you’re quick-witted. Do you understand what to do now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I will call the leaders of all parties.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jenna, tell the auxiliary members. Stay in the dormitory and don’t come out under any circumstances.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, got it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa quickly left the reception room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna also followed suit in a hurry. Eloka looked at me with a face that said she didn’t understand English.

  “I told you once before. People from other waiting rooms might come.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that happening right now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Exactly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka let out a deep sigh.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really… There’s no time to rest.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s always been like this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If we lose…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We won’t lose.”

  I raised my head.

 <p>
  The sky was getting darker, I looked up.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘You want an airship, right?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Airships are high-level items that require a lot of time, skill, and funds.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, there’s a very simple way to obtain them.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll get you one.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Very, very simple way.
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled and left the reception room.

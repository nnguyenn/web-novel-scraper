 <p>
  After a while.
 </p>
 <p>
  The leaders of each party gathered in the lobby.
 </p>

 <p>
  Laiman, who had been licking his lips, spoke first.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is it true that people from another waiting room are coming?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve confirmed it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Unbelievable…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis opened her mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Han, you called us for a reason. You have an idea, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The task is already set.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I said after taking a sip of the water on the table.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll just turn the tables on them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is it a war?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  I shook my head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Leave this matter to Party 1. You guys stay prepared, and if anything happens, help when I signal.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is five of us enough?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s no need to go all out from the beginning.
 </p>
 <p>
  If their goal is to loot, then we’ll act accordingly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The meeting ended quickly.

 <p>
  There’s nothing special. The support heroes head to their lodgings.
 </p>
 <p>
  Except for Party 1, the combatant heroes will wait at the equipment manufacturing facility until I give them a sign.
 </p>
 <p>
  I stepped out into the square.
 </p>
 <p>
  Below the glass floor, I could see the lower floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  The members of the equipment manufacturing facility were rushing into their lodgings.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s boring, but it’s going well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist touched his sword sheath.
 </p>
 <p>
  His rugged face already showed signs of life.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t use it recklessly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “When else should I use it?”

  “Don’t kill. There’s so many other things to do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Killing is the last resort.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hero protection systems are in place until the 40th floor. Even if a hero dies during PVP, they will only suffer a penalty and won’t disappear.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anyway.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked to the side.
 </p>
 <p>
  Members of Party 1, including Velkist, were gathered.
 </p>
 <p>
  The instructions had already been given, and determination filled their eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t be too nervous. It’s not much different from a mission.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ve done all sorts of things, and this is beyond anything else!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry and let’s get started.”

 <p>
  Jenna saluted vigorously and went down the stairs.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka grumbled and followed, and Neryssa and Velkist followed behind. Everyone except me was heading downstairs.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s no need to go all at once.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If even one person dies, it can lead to significant losses.
 </p>
 <p>
  The penalty for death is a permanent decrease in all stats and skills. It’s a risk equivalent to death that can turn a promising hero into trash in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m enough alone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I also had insurance for emergencies.
 </p>
 <p>
  The rest is just waiting. I put on leather gloves and slowly descended the stairs. The destination is the dimensional rift on the 2nd floor. It’s where the other guys will enter.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were dark corners everywhere in the dimensional rift.
 </p>
 <p>
  I hid in one of the shadows and lowered my body.

 <p>
  5 minutes later.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Danger!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, an unauthorized airship has entered the waiting room!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Airship ‘Capitalism Ho’ is anchoring.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Ohm!
 </p>
 <p>
  The dimensional vortex shone blue and the front of the airship appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have no alarm system.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Master’s hero doesn’t detect the intrusion. If attacked by surprise, it could result in significant damage. Be cautious!]
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s not that big.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even so, it was the size of a medium-sized merchant ship, over 10 meters. The airship emerged from the vortex with a flag on the mast. A skull with an eyepatch was drawn on the red flag.

 <p>
  “Is no one here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hahaha, did another sucker get caught this time? This is so fun!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Laughter erupted from the airship.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang. Creak. Wooden stairs began to descend.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I put my hand on the sheath and lowered my posture even more.
 </p>
 <p>
  Five men were coming down the stairs. They were wearing red leather armor and had various weapons, including swords, on their backs.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not welcoming here! How boring.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Based on my experience, the warehouse should be on the 1st floor!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A short guy opened the door at the bottom of the airship.

 <p>
  A large cart appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Bring me a big box. Full of gold coins.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sure thing!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The guy took out the cart revealing his only three front teeth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You know what to do with eyewitnesses?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, bring them back half-dead, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right. We need to synthesize it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If those guys attack us…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll escape quickly and come back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘As expected.’

 <p>
  They are not considering a full-on confrontation.
 </p>
 <p>
  What they want is to loot the warehouse.
 </p>
 <p>
  Four out of five of them pulled the cart and left.
 </p>
 <p>
  Their plan is to go down to the first-floor warehouse, load it up with gold and valuable materials, and then return. If they happen to run into anyone, they will immediately try to silence them. They plan to incapacitate or kidnap them after partially injuring them.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘And.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If things start to look bad, the fifth guy will intervene.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hit and run. It’s quite a deadly tactic. Without an alarm system to alert the heroes to the enemy’s intrusion, the Master will find his waiting room half dead.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh~”
 </p>
 <p>
  The guy yawned while leaning against the airship.
 </p>
 <p>
  He’s acting so carefree. I stayed hidden and slowly approached the vicinity of the airship.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m so tired… huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The guy’s pupils caught me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sh*t! When did…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I grabbed the guy by the hair and pulled him towards me, slamming my knee into his face.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the sound of teeth breaking, blood splattered. Then, I slammed his face against the wall of the airship. Thud! Thud! Thud! Whack! After breaking his arm, I tossed him to the ground. Spraying blood, the guy’s body slid across the floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ohm!
 </p>
 <p>
  The airship started to move.
 </p>
 <p>
  I grabbed the end of the folding stairs and climbed up, then I made a big leap.
 </p>
 <p>
  I landed on the deck and immediately rushed to the control room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bam!
 </p>

  When I kicked the door, I saw a man operating the device.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What the hell are you so busy with?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Y-you crazy…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The guy pulled out a dagger and swung it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh. I easily dodged it and grabbed the guy’s wrist, twisting it in the opposite direction. Crack.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aaaargh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Holding onto the guy’s limp wrist, he sank to his knees.
 </p>
 <p>
  I kicked the guy’s face hard like a soccer ball. Blood splattered on the glass window.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh, agh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are the only seven people that came here?”
 </p>

 <p>
  “I-I don’t know…”
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s no way he wouldn’t know.
 </p>
 <p>
  I firmly held onto the broken wrist of the guy.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Tell me. Before I finish you off.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They’re all here, all seven of them!”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There are no Magicians.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I licked my lips.
 </p>
 <p>
  A dazzling hologram appeared on the device panel in front of me.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed to be in automatic mode, moving with simple manipulation. I looked down at the man who was crying while sitting on the floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  “When are you leaving?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “W-well, originally in 10 minutes! But since I touched it, it will take 5 minutes…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  I struck the back of the man’s head with the knife sheath.
 </p>
 <p>
  The man with a broken head fell, bleeding.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is it on automatic mode?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Things got troublesome.
 </p>
 <p>
  Right now, the airship is in a stopped state, but after a certain amount of time, it will automatically start moving again. And it will return to its original location.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Han.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;What happened?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s been taken care of. There shouldn’t be a need for your help. Just wait for 10 minutes and then go back and get some sleep. Don’t wait for us.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;What are you talking about? What do you mean don’t wait for us?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  I cut off communication.

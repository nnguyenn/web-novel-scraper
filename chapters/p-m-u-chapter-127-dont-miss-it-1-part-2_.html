 <p>
  Then they would capture a large number of heroes and synthesize them with their own heroes. It was a pattern of repetition. The reason a lot of masters folded in this sector was probably because of him.

  “You won’t say you don’t know, right? That if you have a conscience.”

 <p>
  “I… I…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio lowered his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You were a collaborator.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I just followed orders!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you go back, you’ll receive the same instructions.”
 </p>
 <p>
  During the raid, I found that some heroes seemed unusually distracted.
 </p>
 <p>
  They must belong to other waiting rooms. They would be used as slaves and synthesized when they became useless. Hunter’s waiting rooms were operated in this way.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But my master… my master isn’t like that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio’s complexion darkened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “He wasn’t like that originally. Right now, he’s just…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm, is that so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I… I trust my master…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio’s words trailed off.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Trusting the master?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The user has no interest in what thoughts their heroes have.
 </p>
 <p>
  They only pursue their own enjoyment. It’s just a game, after all.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the master in question may have initially been a strategist, he got a taste for looting, and it became more fun. It’s just that it turned out that way.

  “He’s having grand delusions.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you think he’ll change?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Think about it carefully. Do you want to unleash your abilities here, or will you perish there?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was going to make a suggestion!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What were you going to suggest? Stop looting?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Unless it’s a special case, heroes who express such opinions are immediately synthesized.
 </p>
 <p>
  He won’t be killed outright because he’s a mage, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Poor thing.”

  Jenna muttered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “At least our master isn’t like that. He listens to our opinions and takes care of various things for us.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He’s gradually coming around.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio slumped.
 </p>
 <p>
  His eyes were notably lifeless. It seemed like he might collapse if I pushed a little more.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you join us, we’ll guarantee a few things.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He pretended not to listen, but Katiio’s ears perked up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “First, a life without overtime.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s a lie…”

 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna covered Eloka’s mouth and dragged him out.
 </p>
 <p>
  When did she come in?
 </p>
 <p>
  “We guarantee rest outside of work. You can do whatever you want in your spare time. There’s a lounge and a bathhouse. Plenty of food too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did that bastard of a master ever care about your welfare?”
 </p>
 <p>
  He might have provided him alcohol, but it wouldn’t be of any merit to him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Second, we don’t engage in senseless looting.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But you did today!”

  “Only if they provoke us first. You know that too. He came to loot us first. We’ll find out when we check the airship records. Shall we make a bet?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio lowered his head again.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re all about climbing. We focus on missions. We don’t pay attention to unnecessary places. Unless there’s a special need.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This place has no meaning for me. It’s not my home.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you have any special attachment? Family left behind?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t have that… It’s none of your business okay?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Good, that condition is settled.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I spoke up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Third condition, we won’t discriminate against you for being from a different region.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmph, are you some kind of leader?”

  “I’m not a leader, but I have at least some status.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Discrimination is a serious issue when acquiring heroes from different regions, surprisingly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even in Niflheimr, I had a hard time with those who fought because of conflicts related to their origin and race.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Guaranteed rest, mission priority, no discrimination. These are the three things I can guarantee.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No overtime, really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t Lis…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Keep it quiet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A scream from Eolka could be heard from outside the door.
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled and said, “Really.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…It’s suspicious.”

  I approached Katiio and untied not only his arms but also the ropes tied around his torso and legs.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Apologize for the rudeness so far.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “To treat me like this…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m not telling you to decide right away. Take your time to look around here and think it over.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio gave me a piercing look, then rubbed his arm, which still bore the marks of the rope, before turning and walking out. The door opened again, and Jenna entered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is it okay to leave him alone?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Iselle.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Cute fairy, Iselle appears!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Keep the dimensional rift locked. If you sense anything suspicious, let us know immediately.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Okay!]

  Plop.
 </p>
 <p>
  She disappeared right away.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…She’s something.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s fine like this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, Eolka entered the room.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re really spoiling him. I’m a magician too, so why treat me differently?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Because you’re not a prized catch.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t need special treatment just because I’m not a prized catch.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re surprisingly jealous.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jealous? I’m normal.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I laughed without saying a word.
 </p>
 <p>
  I understand. You were treated like a noble until a competitor appeared. A 4-star with a higher rank. In reality…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anyway, we won’t let him go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even if he says he doesn’t want to?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course. By force, if necessary.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The value of a mage is unique.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even without the airship operation.
 </p>
 <p>
  In battles, he provides party support with highly efficient auxiliary magic, and in non-combat situations, they act as enchanters adding various enchantments. In addition, he was a top-class talent who was treated as a semi-5 star, he had a high research capability and could produce high-level potions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, I… if he says he doesn’t like it…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Will you send him back? To that guy?”

  “Not exactly, but… I suggest giving it some time.”

 <p>
  ‘She clearly doesn’t want him here. Even though she was complaining about not wanting to work alone.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I got up from the chair and collapsed on the bed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m going to sleep. If anything happens, wake me up. Oh, and you can guide him around the waiting room.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Should I ask Jenna instead?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eolka left the room with a complicated expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna also said goodnight and followed Eolka.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’m sleepy.’

 <p>
  I thought as I lay on the bed.
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s still a lot to do. I have to visit that damn waiting room once more.
 </p>
 <p>
  If there’s an airship, there must be mechanics. We have to bring them too. Once we stick a straw in, we have to suck out every bit. In addition, I need to check the party’s condition once again and plan for the future…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is completely…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Workaholic?
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t expect it to be like this when I was on Earth.
 </p>
 <p>
  I closed my eyes with a bitter smile.

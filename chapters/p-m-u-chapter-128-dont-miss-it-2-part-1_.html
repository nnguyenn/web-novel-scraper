  [World Raid No.7, Coming soon…]

  Anytng skipped the announcements and entered Pick Me Up’s main screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, there are multiple unverified activities reported. Would you like to check?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as Anytng pressed ‘Yes,’ unexpected fireworks exploded.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Airship Appearance!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Congratulations, Master, on acquiring the airship!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Acquired Unfair – Capitalism]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tips/What is an Airship?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Airships are the core vehicle for exploiting dimensional rifts. For more details, search for Airships in the help section!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [A new hero has joined.]

 <p>
  [This hero is currently ‘detained.’]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, there is unverified loot!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Acquired items – 14 types]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Acquired gold…]
 </p>
 <p>
  The reports filled the screen entirely.
 </p>
 <p>
  Information about the Airship and the new mage, acquired items, and gold. Brief details about battles with other Masters and the battle’s outcome.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took a sip of water.
 </p>
 <p>
  The cool liquid flowed down my throat. Katiio was sitting on the bed in front of me. Today’s update was mostly done.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng didn’t touch the screen for a few minutes.

  ‘It’s a bit much to say I woke up one day and found it like this.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It takes over a week to build an airship.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not only time but also a multitude of gems and various materials were needed, and without a mage, the dimensional core couldn’t even be touched. Therefore, Pick Me Up’s Masters often measured their strength against each other with Airships, just like comparing cars.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s a bit much to calculate last night’s results in terms of money.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Approximately 4.8 million gold.
 </p>
 <p>
  I emptied my glass in silence.
 </p>
 <p>
  The logs of last night’s battle and looting recorded what I did and how I did it. It would be clear that I was the protagonist.

  He pressed the gift icon in the Operations tab. He even fumbled near the icon several times, as if he was shaking. You could tell what he was trying to do without even looking.
 </p>
 <p>
  I glanced to my side.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the fifth-tier display shelf to the right of the bed, there were sculptures of warhorses lined up. Iselle had moved them here from the square. There were three in total.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not the time to pay attention to me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I shook my head and remembered the message.

 <p>
  “Master, the hero ‘Han (★★★)’ suggests.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Request – Recruiting ‘Katiio (★★★★)'”
 </p>

  Katiio, a 4-star mage, was currently detained.
 </p>
 <p>
  He’s not affiliated with Townia. In the Hero Box, he was marked in gray, indicating that manipulation was not possible. To undo this, his heart had to be turned.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you have something you want?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A blunt response.
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio turned his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No matter how sweet you try to tempt me, it won’t work.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This place is a bit better than Harla. Still, I won’t give in.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I see. We have no choice but to synthesize. It’s a 4-star, so it will greatly boost our abilities.”

 </p>
 <p>
  “You can’t raise cockroaches.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio was sweating profoundly.
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled and said, “Just kidding.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You bastard…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What I guarantee are three things. If you have any other demands, let me know. I’ll grant most of them.”

  “Can’t you get me the March issue of Lumagini? It’s only published in Harla…”

  I handed over a magazine featuring a sexy woman in a swimsuit.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Something else.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then how about a fairy feather scarf?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★★★)’ wants ‘Fairy Feather Scarf.’ Would you like to gift it?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s a premium gift!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [It will cost 100 gems and 5,000 gold.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t you have anything else?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where on earth are you getting these from?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio, clumsily wearing the scarf, asked.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like he hadn’t received many gifts before. In addition to various other gifts, I gave him everything he asked for. Nothing wouldn’t be found in the gift shop. There were over thousands of different types. Even I couldn’t remember them all.

  “Lastly…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio stated his request.
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled and got up from my seat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll be back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The timing was perfect.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, ‘Han (★★★)’ requests an expedition.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Expedition Location – Harla]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Purpose – Plunder and Capture]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Will you accept?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where are you going?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “To bring someone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I replied briefly and left the room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then I immediately headed toward the dimensional rift.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’m more than enough alone.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It takes a week for those in death protection to come back to life.
 </p>
 <p>
  I got on the airship.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hey, you little bastard! Why are you here again? Get lost! Go away! Don’t come here!]
 </p>
 <p>
  A moment later.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Here she is.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I placed the woman in work clothes in front of Katiio.

  Her name was Radi, a mechanic for the Airship.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The contract is also done. She will be working with us from now on.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sorry, Katiio.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio, who was staring blankly at the mechanic, asked, “How did you persuade her?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I said I would do it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The mechanic bowed her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m tired of working in a place like that. The Master doesn’t care if we live or die.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio’s eyes wavered.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like both of them needed some time to talk.

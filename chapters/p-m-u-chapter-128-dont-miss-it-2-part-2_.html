 <p>
  Katiio’s eyes wavered.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like both of them needed some time to talk.

 <p>
  I quietly left the room.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How did it go? Do you think it’ll work out?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka, who had been leaning against the wall, approached.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s almost over. We’ll have an answer by today at the latest.”
 </p>
 <p>
  That female mechanic was summoned around the same time as Katyo.
 </p>
 <p>
  They had become something like siblings involved in the airship-related matters. I thought convincing her would be difficult, but she accepted my proposal without hesitation, saying she was sick of that Master.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Which party will that mage join?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m not sure. I’ll have to think about it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Currently, there were no vacancies in the first, second, and third parties, which could be considered Townia’s main force.
 </p>
 <p>
  To utilize him, I would have to remove one from the main party or slot him into the reserve party. However, the second option wasn’t very efficient. Mages excelled when the other members were strong, which was why.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘To use him properly, I’ll have to remove one person.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The third-party was an exception since the races were different, leaving ten members.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was quite a sensitive issue.
 </p>
 <p>
  I decided to think about it later.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Rather than that…’
 </p>
 <p>
  I recalled the scene in Harla.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Master wasn’t online, and lower-tier heroes were working to restore the waiting room, which had become a pile of ashes under the command of the fairy.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s getting troublesome.’

 <p>
  It also costs a considerable amount to restore.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had cleaned out the warehouse. They seemed to have received support from someone, probably the Union Guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  After parting with Eloka, I twisted the ring.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yurnet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Are you calling, Master?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  As if she was waiting, the answer was quick.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;The investigation into the Union Guild that Master instructed has been completed.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “That was quick.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;I will report the results.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet began speaking.

  &lt;The Union Guild was founded six months ago. It seems to be a guild that moved here from a popular mobile game called ‘L.’ In L, they were known as a guild that dominated an entire server. There, they are referred to as a ‘blood alliance.’&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;The entry conditions are quite unique. Limited to males only. Age should be over 30. And a monthly thousand.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “A monthly thousand?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Yes. To be precise, a minimum of 10 million won in monthly expenses is required.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  I let out a hollow laugh.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had a feeling I knew what it was.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;The origin of the name Union Guild seems to have been taken from the greeting style of the original game, L.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Jing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Holographic letters appeared from the ring.

  [Unity ^^7]
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;They exchange greetings like this among members.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  There are countless types of Masters in Pick Me Up.
 </p>
 <p>
  But these guys are quite unique even among the numerous types.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘How many times is it now?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What else is there?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;The purpose of the Union Guild is to dominate and control the entire 2nd server. In reality, they intrude into nearby accounts while climbing sectors, carry out unlimited intrusions and PKs, and collect tribute after using them as hosts. The Independent Masters are trying to resist in any way they can.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “This won’t do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Yes. They have tremendous financial power.&gt;

 <p>
  While Pick Me Up emphasized skill, it was undoubtedly a mobile game.
 </p>
 <p>
  There had to be some sort of payment efficiency. Even difficult missions could be overcome by switching parties dozens of times. PvP was the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s their estimated power?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;There are 73 5-star heroes confirmed as members of the Union Guild and 318 airships. This is based on what has been confirmed, and there is a high possibility of hidden power.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet cleared her throat.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Master, please tell us your response plan. If you order, we will strike preemptively at any time.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Leave it. As long as they don’t start it first.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Someday…&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “They’ll come.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It used to be Dragon Knights,

 <p>
  Then it was Ouroboros.
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, it’s the Union Guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  Such incidents were not uncommon.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some guys would step up, saying they wanted to dominate the server. Their target was Niflheimr. The excuse was that it was the symbol of the 2nd server.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Boring’
 </p>
 <p>
  The guilds that once made a lot of noise on the internet, Dragon Knights and Ouroboros, no longer existed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Did they bring a thousand airships?’
 </p>
 <p>
  So what?
 </p>
 <p>
  The idea of losing never crossed my mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  A thousand airships will just become a thousand pieces of trash.

  After leaving instructions for Yurnet to report if there was anything else, I cut off communication.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just then, the door opened. Katiio was coming out with a gloomy expression. Radi, who had been beside him, bowed to me and left the reception room.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s decided.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I raised my hand in response to Katiio’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle, who was loitering, approached and handed me a pen and a contract.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a blue ink pen and a paper.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sign it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re not tricking me, are you? After signing the contract, I’ll be dragged to some strange place…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You have a good imagination, but of course not.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio glared at me and took the pen.

  After signing his name on the lower part of the contract, the contract and pen turned blue and disappeared into the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★★★)’ has successfully persuaded ‘Katiio (★★★★).’]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Katiio (★★★★)’ is now operable!]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘EZ.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I told Katiio where his room was and returned to my room.
 </p>
 <p>
  From tomorrow, he will be active as a mage of Townia.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Gift Shop!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Gift Shop!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Gifts…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng frantically pressed the gift icon repeatedly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle appeared, spinning in a circle, and approached me.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Loki! Lokii!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Speak softly. You’ll hurt my ears.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It seems like Master wants to give a gift to Loki. Do you want anything?]
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the manipulation screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  He didn’t choose a warhorse statue. He was just waiting.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If you have a gift in mind, just tell me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng seemed to have learned from his mistakes.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the display shelf.
 </p>
 <p>
  Three warhorses were in a galloping pose.

  [‘Han (★★★)’ wants ‘Warhorse Statue x 10,’ would you like to gift it?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [It will cost 50,000 gold.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  One shelf was filled with warhorse statues.
 </p>
 <p>
  Side by side, they depicted a running pose. Now they had some form.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anyway, I had no interest in eating, wearing, or anything else.
 </p>
 <p>
  Receiving expensive and flashy gifts was just for decoration. The only things to do here were training and studying at most. In that case, it would be fine to have this kind of hobby.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I guess I’ll have to gather a thousand.’
 </p>
 <p>
  There are 987 left.

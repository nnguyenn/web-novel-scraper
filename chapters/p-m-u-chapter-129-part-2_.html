  As long as they’re stored in a designated place in the armory, the right consumables can be taken out as needed.

 <p>
  There are a few other limitations.
 </p>
 <p>
  But it was clear that this made combat more flexible.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Dimensional magic is quite an advanced high-level spell…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka swallowed hard.
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned my gaze forward and said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You can close it. It’s useless here anyway.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Clack, clatter! Human! Die!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Lizardman Lv.27] X 31
 </p>
 <p>
  [Lizardman Shaman Lv.29] X 2
 </p>
 <p>
  Lizardmen poured out of the cave, surrounding us.
 </p>
 <p>
  They brandished their weapons towards the sky, glaring at us with furious eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Clatter!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The small-statured lizardman in the lead charged at us, clutching a spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  I stepped lightly, swinging my sword down. Swish. A severed arm, trailing a streak of red blood, flew through the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  The creature let out a pitiful scream and collapsed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just do what we always do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Here I go.”

 <p>
  Me, Velkist, and Jenna began the battle with expressions devoid of tension.
 </p>
 <p>
  We formed a triangular formation around Eloka and Katiio in the center, repelling the enemies.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka, with her eyes closed, began chanting.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I never imagined I would be doing this here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio muttered bitterly, pulling out a small hexagonal stone from his pocket.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was enveloped in a blue aura. It seemed to be a magic stone.
 </p>
 <p>
  【Attribute Enhancement, Activation.】
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio threw the magic stone.
 </p>
 <p>
  The surrounding rocks and sand swirled around the magic stone, gathering to form a massive human-like figure.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A golem?’

 <p>
  The 3-meter tall golem, uttering a strange moan, swung its arms.
 </p>
 <p>
  The lizardman’s face was flattened like a pancake.
 </p>
 <p>
  【Attribute Enhancement, Penetration.】
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio took out a second magic stone.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Katiio (★★★★)’ applies attributes to the entire ‘1st Party’!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Consumable Item – Magic Stone of Strength Enhancement (Low-Grade)]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The entire party’s strength increases.]
 </p>
 <p>
  I quickly checked my stats.
 </p>
 <p>
  My strength had increased by about 5.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A strength-enhancing stone.’

 <p>
  Each time the magic stone shattered in Katiio’s hand, light seeped into the entire body of the party members.
 </p>
 <p>
  All abilities increased. A simple yet efficient buff. Then I looked at Katiio.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Teleportation.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The light-enshrouded golem appeared, having jumped a distance of 10 meters.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Telekinesis.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Higher than Eloka’s level by several grades.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was strong enough to solidify the sand into a high wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Shield.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The bolt shot by a crossbow-wielding lizardman ricocheted off, powerless.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Even interference with spells.’

  The red glow disappeared from the staff of the lizardman shaman who was casting a berserking spell.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Clack? Why is the power……”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist split the creature’s head in half.
 </p>
 <p>
  Next to him, Eloka’s flame burst forth. A charred body, ignited by the explosion, scattered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka withdrew her hand and opened a mana potion.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You don’t have to.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Blue mana threads seeped into Eloka.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh, what.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It seems mana transfer is also possible.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A few minutes later.

  The courtyard in front of the cave was piled high with the bodies of lizardmen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna muttered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How many things he can do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why don’t you ask directly?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I flicked the blood off my sword blade and sheathed it.
 </p>
 <p>
  A few were left, but it was fine. They were huddled in a corner, trembling.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s really fascinating. I thought all magicians just blasted fire or lightning.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Traditionally, that’s the norm. Elemental magic has a history of thousands of years, a prestigious…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Remnants of the old generation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, remnants of the old generation… not!”

 <p>
  Smooth dodge.
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled lightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t feel it. I think the female magician is better.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not apparent on the outside.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In small-scale, short-term battles, elemental mages are naturally more efficient.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t know how you guys fight, so I can’t adjust to it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio grumbled, looking at the scattered corpses.
 </p>
 <p>
  Over 50 in total. We were unscathed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You seem to fight better than I thought.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, are you ready to do this properly?”

 <p>
  With a thrust.
 </p>
 <p>
  I ended the life of one more creature.
 </p>
 <p>
  The last monster. As the ‘Stage Clear’ message appeared, my body began to be enveloped in light.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But fighting here, instead of Harla…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Take your time to think. We have plenty of it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s still a lot of time.
 </p>
 <p>
  It would be good to judge after estimating this mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are definitely forms where elemental mages struggle.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng, who logged in in the evening, seemed to have a similar thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  Initially, I tried to put her in the 2nd party, but after Edis’s refusal message popped up, I didn’t force a reshuffle. I just gave Katiio instructions for research and airship management.
 </p>
 <p>
  After finishing the basic instructions, a popup window appeared for Anytng.
 </p>
 <p>
  A message that had appeared several times since the last raid.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, an unidentified channel chat has been detected.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Would you like to check it?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes(Select) / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  Even Anytng, who had been consistently ignoring it, touched ‘Yes’ out of curiosity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sinene &gt; Hey.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sinene &gt; Feels good using someone else’s hero and airship, huh?
 </p>
 <p>
  Sinene &gt; Worthless ***. You’re done for. Treating you kindly and you see people as fools.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sinene &gt; Think this is the end? LOL. There were a few like you. Just wait, one week from now.

  The chat window disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng continued the game as if nothing happened.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He should give up.’
 </p>
 <p>
  All the main heroes were dead, and the magicians and airships were taken.
 </p>
 <p>
  Every core facility was burned down, and the facility levels had also dropped. It’s a significant loss, requiring more than a month and a huge amount of gems for recovery. Yet, the attitude was overly confident.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There’s something to do before moving on to the main mission.’
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yurnet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;You called, Master.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet continued.

  &lt;I am aware of the situation. If you command, I will immediately deploy the fleet.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t use the fleet. Unless they target Niflheimr.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If that’s not my response, then there’s no point in returning to Townia.
 </p>
 <p>
  But there’s also a risk involved. I have something else in mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  I finished my drink to the last drop.

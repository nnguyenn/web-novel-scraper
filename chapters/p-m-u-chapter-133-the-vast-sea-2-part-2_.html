  I dragged Katiio down to the first floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Afterwards, the door to the space-time rift closed.

 <p>
  “Eloka sister… isn’t here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna twirled her red hair with her fingers.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I told you. She’s not coming this time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Before coming out, I saw her buried in a pile of books at the magic library.
 </p>
 <p>
  I spoke to Katiio, who was standing dumbfoundedly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “From now on, you’re temporarily part of the 1st party. Remember that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What, what? Why tell me this now!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ve been sleeping all day.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I stayed up all night for maintenance!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anyway, that’s how it is. I’m sorry if it’s all of a sudden.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s, it’s okay.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio surveyed the 1st party members with unfamiliar eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist narrowed his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you looking at?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Nothing.”

 <p>
  The message for the mission start appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll be back soon, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Just before being engulfed in light, Jenna muttered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We will.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa replied with a light smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  The view changed.

 <p>
  Salty wind brushed my cheeks.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sea and boat. The mission continued directly from the end of the 31st floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The sea?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio tilted his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  I explained the basic outline of the mission to Katiio.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just follow the direction of the compass needle. Expect monster attacks along the way.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just follow the compass, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Set the sail and row…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why bother with that? It’s so troublesome.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio spoke disdainfully and stretched out his hand.

 <p>
  Magical threads spiraled behind the boat, forming a whirl.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The boat shot forward like a motorboat.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the rocking boat, Velkist kept his balance and asked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How did you do that? Is it wind magic?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, I created a makeshift propulsion device with magic.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Strong wind hit my cheeks.
 </p>
 <p>
  Speed easily surpassing 20-30 km/h.
 </p>
 <p>
  The boat plowed through the water, leaving foam behind.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s a headwind this time.’

 <p>
  The wind was blowing in the opposite direction of our target.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the boat moved forward without any delay.
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to the 31st floor, it was several times faster.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems we’ve been toiling in vain till now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist spoke with bitterness.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Should we just throw away these oars?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Just put them in the corner.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In an instant, the oars had become useless.
 </p>
 <p>
  After a while.

  Dark shadows followed alongside the boat.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took off his gloves. I was the only one capable of swimming.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll do it the same way this time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You will lure them in and I’ll cover, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I decided to cut my palm once I was in the water.
 </p>
 <p>
  Holding a dagger, I approached the edge of the boat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hold on a second.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio dipped his right hand into the sea.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle!

  Float.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nine sharks surfaced around the boat, unconscious.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna’s eyes widened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What, what is this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I sent out an electromagnetic field to knock them out. Sharks have organs sensitive to electricity.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio answered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist quietly spoke to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What else can this guy do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio waved his hand, and the boat set off again.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had asked what he could do before.

 <p>
  I had even brought him to a battle to see it in action.
 </p>
 <p>
  But it seems there was so much more he was capable of doing.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A mage scholar after all.’
 </p>
 <p>
  While individual mage scholars are talented in certain things, this one seemed capable of many things.
 </p>
 <p>
  I started an investigation with Katiio.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You can manipulate surface tension?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Without hesitation, Katiio stepped outside the boat.
 </p>
 <p>
  Circular ripples spread as his feet touched the surface.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Like this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio was standing on the water.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can do this for you guys too. There are a few conditions though.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It seems that we can move on the surface of the water if he supports us with his magic.
 </p>
 <p>
  While casting, other magic cannot be used, but the duration is almost infinite. If you’re careful about strong impacts, it won’t be dispelled even with rough movements. It’s like acting on flat ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If this guy was with us on the 30th floor… many things would have been different.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa swallowed her words.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s not just water.’
 </p>
 <p>
  You could even run vertically up a 90-degree cliff using magic.
 </p>
 <p>
  There would have been no need to risk climbing the arms of the statue.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was wrong about you. You’re very useful. Looking forward to working with you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist said.

  “Sister could do this too. She said she’d learn it quickly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Elementalists can’t. The nature of their magic is different.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio spoke firmly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna lowered her head, looking disappointed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, we’ll see.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The boat continued to move.
 </p>
 <p>
  No need to row, no need to be on high alert.
 </p>
 <p>
  If enemies approached, Katiio would inform me before the appearance message even popped up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This mission seems ten times easier, doesn’t it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s just the right situation for it.”

 <p>
  Common foes were outrun by speeding up the boat, and if not, they were dealt with using auxiliary magic.
 </p>
 <p>
  The difficulty of this mission stemmed from the environment.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the conditions met, battles didn’t even last 5 minutes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, a day and night passed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  At the horizon’s edge.
 </p>
 <p>
  A faint brown dot floated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa narrowed her eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It looks like a large sailing ship.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the compass.
 </p>
 <p>
  The red needle pointed in the direction of the ship.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That’s the only option.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Turning around, Katiio nodded and waved his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  The speed of cutting through the water increased significantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gradually, the dot expanded.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a large wooden sailing ship.
 </p>
 <p>
  Huge sails hung from multiple masts.
 </p>
 <p>
  The height difference was over 10 meters.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our boat slid through the water and attached to its rear.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked up.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the railing inside the ship, someone was watching the sea with a troubled expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Ha.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A sigh escaped my lips.
 </p>
 <p>
  Golden eyes, holding the sea, suddenly suddenly shined on me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you fare well?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you doing there!”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s her again.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled bitterly.

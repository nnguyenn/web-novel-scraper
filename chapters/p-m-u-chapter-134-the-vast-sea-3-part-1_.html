 <p>
  As I finally came up on deck, Priasis retrieved the rope that had been draped over the railing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her lips were tightly sealed in a straight line.
 </p>

 <p>
  Her eyes mixed with surprise and confusion.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her silver hair had grown a bit longer, and she wore a plain dress.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked around the ship.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was large enough to be called a sailing vessel, but there were hardly any people in sight.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was one man fiddling with the sail at the stern of the ship.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You folks sure know how to surprise me time and again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis spoke in a weak voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna laughed awkwardly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, hello?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s with her? Why is she talking like that… Ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll be going inside to rest.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa dragged Katiio into the ship.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re coming with me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I should leave too right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, it would be burdensome for the princess if we all crowded her at once, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The other two also went inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the deck, only Priasis and I remained.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the silence lingered, I broke it.

 <p>
  “Should I go in too? I want to sleep.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis puffed her cheeks.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really! I have a mountain of questions. How did you end up on that small boat in the sea, how did you find the ship’s location, what on earth is your goal this time…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a mission.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis looked at me, demanding a detailed explanation, but I didn’t know either.
 </p>
 <p>
  How would I know? It just turned out this way while doing the mission. As I kept silent, Priasis sighed deeply.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I thought I wouldn’t get involved with you this time…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “When we first met, you asked me to help. Why the change now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Back then… I didn’t know it would be this dangerous. Several of your companions have died, haven’t they?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I told you to not feel burdened.”

 <p>
  “It’s not as easy as it sounds.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis hung her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Indeed.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It seems she feels burdened by us.
 </p>
 <p>
  I told her not to worry since we weren’t doing it for her, but knowing her personality, it won’t be easy.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, where are we now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You came without even knowing that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis looked at me as if it was ridiculous.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once again, I had no answer.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We are in the southeastern seas of the continent, known as the Infinite Sea…”

 <p>
  “Got it. Tell me what you’re looking for. Is it a key again?”
 </p>
 <p>
  After a moment’s hesitation, she replied.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The first was a desert, the second the sea. Quite the environmental shift.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis explained the events after the 30th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  After defeating the statue, returning with the key, and having its authenticity recognized by the Assinis family, she was able to receive support for their subsequent search activities.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This ship was lent by the family, as were the sailors.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The man adjusting the sail glanced over here before continuing his work.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We also received a subsidy. I plan to hire mercenaries on a nearby island. With this, I should be able to find the key without your help.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “And if a monster like before appears?”
 </p>

 <p>
  Priasis coughed awkwardly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, anyway, we’ll turn the ship back to the port…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No need for mercenaries. Don’t call anyone. If you don’t want to increase the body count.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just show us the way. We’ll handle the rest.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The situation was similar to the 30th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  The only difference was a change in members.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Still as stubborn as ever.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis gave a bitter smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sorry, but we can’t refuse our mission, whatever it may be.”
 </p>

  “What if the mission is to kill me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’d have to do it. Unless I want to die myself.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I would regret it a lot, but I was already prepared for anything.
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s no guarantee that the mission will always be about helping others or defeating monsters.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis rummaged through her belongings and laid down a small leather pouch.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gold coins glittered through the opening.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is all my wealth. I’ll hire you as mercenaries. I’m not that shameless.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We don’t need it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t make me feel ashamed.”

 <p>
  Then I won’t refuse.
 </p>
 <p>
  I accepted the gold coins.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Negotiation Successful!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han(★★★)’ has acquired 10,000 gold from the special NPC ‘Priasis.’]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘10,000 gold, huh.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In Pick Me Up, it’s not a large sum.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s only enough to buy two horse statues.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nevertheless, I decided to accept it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I’m counting on you again this time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis reached out her hand with a slightly awkward gesture.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-12" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  When I grabbed it, her hand shook up and down.
 </p>
 <p>
  “When you call me…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kid?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Call me Pria. I’ll call you by your name too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Pria…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a nickname. I’d prefer if you call me by it, Han.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis smiled faintly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, it doesn’t matter.
 </p>
 <p>
  Afterward, Priasis shared more details about her time at sea.
 </p>
 <p>
  Initially, they planned to stop by a pirate island teeming with mercenaries to supplement their crew, but with us joining, there was no need. They decided to head straight to the location of the key.
 </p>
 <p>
  “And one more thing about the key.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Tell me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If we gather all the keys… they can open a gate to a higher dimension.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I froze at the unexpected statement.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing my reaction as out of the ordinary, Priasis blinked several times.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s the point of doing that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s obvious, isn’t it? To save the continent…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What does a higher dimension have to do with the continent?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…That is.”
 </p>

 <p>
  Priasis seemed unsure herself.
 </p>
 <p>
  Frustrated. I frowned. Even if I don’t want to think too deeply, there are too many incomprehensible aspects to the mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The dream…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anything can be a dream. Isn’t that too convenient?”
 </p>
 <p>
  In her dream, Priasis saw us fighting.
 </p>
 <p>
  She also saw a future of destruction and decided to save the continent.
 </p>
 <p>
  The keys were needed to open the gate to the higher dimension.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking about it, almost all the missions were connected to her.
 </p>
 <p>
  We directly encountered her on the 15th, 25th, and 30th floors, and the 20th floor involved a mission to subdue the leader of a force deeply involved in her pursuit.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘How is this going to save the continent.’
 </p>

 <p>
  The 5th and 10th floors, preventing goblin attacks, were the only ones somewhat similar.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the windy deck, only Priasis and I were left.
 </p>
 <p>
  The man adjusting the sail was gone.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you… angry?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, just thinking.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I shut my mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  It feels like something is almost within reach, but not quite.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need more information.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at Priasis standing blankly and said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “About that dream, tell me more…”

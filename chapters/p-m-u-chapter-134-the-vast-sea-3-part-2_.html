  It feels like something is almost within reach, but not quite.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need more information.’

 <p>
  I looked at Priasis standing blankly and said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “About that dream, tell me more…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stage Clear!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Velkist(★★★)’, ‘Katiio(★★★★)’, Level Up!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Reward – 170,000G, Lower
 </p>
 <p>
  Grade Shark Gills X 3]
 </p>
 <p>
  [MVP – ‘Katiio(★★★★)’]
 </p>
 <p>
  Light began to envelop me.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Talk about timing.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled bitterly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis’s eyes sparkled as she watched me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That light…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m returning to the original place. The contract isn’t over, so don’t worry.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Weren’t you going to ask something?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s fine. I’ve changed my mind.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I have no motivation to save this place anyway.
 </p>
 <p>
  If nothing unusual happens, it should be okay to proceed as is.
 </p>
 <p>
  “See you next time.”

 <p>
  “Ah, got it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With Priasis’s bewildered response, I returned to the round room.
 </p>
 <p>
  I first looked up.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Master had disconnected.
 </p>
 <p>
  Given the time-consuming nature of the mission, they couldn’t have continued to watch.
 </p>
 <p>
  The current time in the waiting room was late at night.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But still.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Logs about Katiio’s actions would remain.
 </p>
 <p>
  I could also rewind the mission footage.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’m satisfied.’

 <p>
  Velkist was smirking, looking at Katiio.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What, what? You’re giving me the creeps.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Will this kid join our training tomorrow? I think we need a different formation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist’s gaze turned to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come to the reception room by 7 AM tomorrow.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have to maintain the airship in the morning…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do it at night.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist spoke as if it was nothing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then it’s overtime! That’s different from the contract!”

  “Contracts always change before and after they’re made.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, I won’t accept this abuse!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This does complicate the schedule.”
 </p>
 <p>
  An unidentified message popped up in the operation window of Anytng.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, from the 33rd floor, you can use the airship!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Bring a ‘Wizard’ class hero, select the summon tab, and touch the airship!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [However, the airship must be in a summonable state.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘An airship.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The ship appeared in the latter part of the mission.
 </p>

 <p>
  This meant that ships could be replaced by airships.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flying might not be possible due to field characteristics.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the airship’s maintenance wasn’t finished yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, once you join Party 1, formation practice is essential.
 </p>
 <p>
  But neither can be excluded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I cleared my throat and continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ll have to work a bit harder.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Dammit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’d like to give you a rest, but there’s no choice due to the schedule.”
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-6" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  “I knew it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio slumped his shoulders.
 </p>
 <p>
  “When the schedule is over, I’ll give you double the holiday. I promise.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Fine, fine. Tomorrow morning at 7. I’ll be there.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio walked out through the space-time gap with a fed-up expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  The other members also gradually left the room. I stared at the message on the mirror above the square that read ‘Save the World!’ before heading to the square.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then I encountered an unexpected person.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How was that wizard?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka stood there, wrapped in a scarf and coat given by the Master, instead of her usual dress.
 </p>
 <p>
  “According to Vel, he played a significant part.”
 </p>

  “Why are you here? Not on the 3rd floor?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I came down for a walk and thought of you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A walk to the 1st floor?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “T-that’s how I felt! Anyway, how was it? While you were in the mission…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka spread her palms out.
 </p>
 <p>
  A breeze played over them.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I managed somehow. Just one month…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Iselle.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Appear!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Stardust twinkled next to us, and Iselle popped out.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-12" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  I asked Iselle, who was gazing at me intently.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How many regeneration stones are left?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hmm, about 7 left.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Give one to her. Log it in the system as if I took it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Shortly after, Iselle brought a black stone swirling with energy from the warehouse.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A regeneration stone. It lets you view the mission footage.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I placed the stone in Eloka’s hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  After giving Iselle a cue, the space-time gap opened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ll know everything you need about him when you see it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s the footage from when I wasn’t there?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright. Let’s take a look.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka took a deep breath and entered the space-time gap.
 </p>
 <p>
  The door closed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Eloka(★★★)’ has started viewing!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The 32nd floor is long, but the viewer can fast-forward if they wish.
 </p>
 <p>
  You should be able to get an estimate of a few hours-long mission. I settled on a nearby bench.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle flapped her wings and said.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Aren’t you going to sleep? It’s late.]
 </p>

  “I’ll just rest for a bit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Are you worried about the fire magician? I don’t see why! She’s powerful indeed, but useless otherwise. I think the little wizard is much better.]
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t respond.
 </p>
 <p>
  [That woman, always acting so superior. Serves her right, heh!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle laughed sinisterly and disappeared with the light.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sat on the bench and crossed my arms.
 </p>
 <p>
  Occasionally, heroes from the 1st floor appeared and passed by, staring blankly at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  And as dawn deepened.
 </p>
 <p>
  The door to the square opened with a thud.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you watch it well?”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Didn’t you go?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I couldn’t sleep.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why did you wait?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka, noticeably worn, sat next to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “He was impressive.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He’s a wizard.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The world is unfair. At such a young age. Back then, I hadn’t even started my training.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wizards can’t be judged by their appearance, can they?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s obvious he’s young.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka sighed deeply.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If I knew this would happen, I would have studied harder.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you wish, you can join another party…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t want to be anywhere but here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka opened her mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I haven’t given up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll be there by 7 AM tomorrow, right? I’m also a prospective first-party member, so there should be an opportunity. See you later.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka ended the conversation on her own terms, chuckled, and got up.
 </p>
 <p>
  She climbed the stairs and disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is something.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron was the same. I don’t understand why they’re so fixated.
 </p>
 <p>
  It would be easier to shift to a researcher at this opportunity. The Master might dislike it, but I was willing to help with that. I had prepared a few reasons.
 </p>
 <p>
  I think I understand, but then again, maybe not.
 </p>
 <p>
  I shook my head and headed towards the stairs.

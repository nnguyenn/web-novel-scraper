  Several days later.

 <p>
  [The airship ‘Capitalism’ has completed its maintenance!]

 <p>
  [You can now deploy the airship for missions. However, it can only be deployed within permitted areas.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Vroom.
 </p>
 <p>
  Capitalism, having finished its assembly, was now undergoing a test run.
 </p>
 <p>
  Its exposed interior was now covered with sturdy iron plates, and the fuel system expansion and other facility renovations were also completed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is something.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching the airship spinning around the rift of space-time, I clicked my tongue.
 </p>
 <p>
  After clearing the 32nd floor, we hadn’t progressed in climbing for almost a week.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Looks like someone was eager to use it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Though we had acquired the airship, there were hardly any sections where it could be used effectively.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, just in time, we received permission to use it on the 33rd floor. It’s natural to want to drive a new car. There was no way he wouldn’t be excited.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Buoyancy is good. Fuel efficiency is good. No damage seen.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Radi, wearing a mechanic’s suit, filled out the airship’s inspection form with checks.
 </p>
 <p>
  “With this, it should be ready for missions.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We still don’t have any facilities on board, and the weapons aren’t installed. We haven’t even done a flight check, have we?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio emerged from the cockpit and said.
 </p>
 <p>
  The airship had stopped at its original position.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This place is the ocean, right? It’s not like we can fly anyway.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That may be so, but…”

 <p>
  “If you want to do more maintenance, I don’t mind.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Enough! I feel like dying day by day.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio spoke as if he was fed up and then descended the stairs.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dark circles were etched under his eyes, a result of nearly a week of working through dawn.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was fooled. I was totally fooled. This is even tougher than Harla! Damn it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio covered his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Katiio(★★★★)’ expresses his dissatisfaction!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng, noticing Katiio’s dissatisfaction, moved the operation window.
 </p>
 <p>
  The screen changed to the gift shop.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Gifting a Horse Statue’ to ‘Katiio(★★★★)’.]

 <p>
  “How many times are you going to do this? I told you I don’t need this kind of thing!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio threw away the horse statue that appeared out of thin air with disgust.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Katiio(★★★★)’ is disappointed with the ‘Horse Statue’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Affection decreased!]
 </p>
 <p>
  I picked up the horse statue that was thrown on the floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  An ownerless object.
 </p>
 <p>
  I decided to place it in the display cabinet.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you doing here anyway?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Am I not allowed to be here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I put the statue in my pocket and said.

  “I came to see since it seemed like the airship’s repairs were finished.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “As you can see. For now, its operational capability is fine. It’s navigable. But…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There are no facilities or weapons on board, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It will take some more time. It’s not something we two can handle.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just repairing the exterior wasn’t enough.
 </p>
 <p>
  Currently, the inside of Capitalism was eerily empty. To function properly, it needed various facilities and weapons to be installed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But why does that female mage keep fussing around? The party’s supposed to be five members only.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio tilted his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Try to understand.”
 </p>

 <p>
  I laughed and said.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Katiio was included in the training Eloka was also there beside him.
 </p>
 <p>
  She ran around the field, did physical training, and practiced fire and wind magic in the newly established magic training ground. She couldn’t participate in the formation training, though.
 </p>
 <p>
  A week later.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No progress, huh.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The formation with Katiio was roughly organized, and the members’ roles were established, but Eloka’s wind training didn’t progress much. She went from a breeze to a draft.
 </p>
 <p>
  Elemental mages fundamentally control only one attribute.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mages who handle more than two attributes are rare, with a probability of less than 10%. The likelihood that Eloka was among them was slim.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘She’s spinning her wheels.’
 </p>
 <p>
  What Eloka needed wasn’t wind magic.
 </p>

 <p>
  It was firepower worth taking risks for.
 </p>
 <p>
  Currently, Eloka was high risk, low return.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anyway, she was used from the beginning with risks in mind. To return, she had to realize that. I wanted to intervene, watching her struggle in vain, but I kept silent, thinking she should realize it on her own.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, she’ll learn eventually.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The climb had slowed due to the airship maintenance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now was the time to prepare for the 35th floor. I listened to Katiio and Radi talking about the airship’s overall conditions for a while and then returned to my quarters.
 </p>
 <p>
  The next evening.
 </p>
 <p>
  [1st party, gather!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng called the 1st party.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though it had been a while since we were called, everyone entered the rift in time and space with calm expressions.
 </p>

 <p>
  As expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Main Dungeon, current challenge floor is the 33rd.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The door will open in 10 seconds. Get ready!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Mission recording in progress. Play records will be preserved.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The airship can be used.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The usual messages announcing the mission floor appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  And one more notification.
 </p>
 <p>
  “33rd floor, huh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’ll continue on the ship, I guess.”
 </p>
 <p>
  We exchanged trivial chatter as we were summoned to the mission field.

 <p>
  Splash.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sound of waves hitting the ear.
 </p>
 <p>
  The distinctive smell of the sea brushed against the nose.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…We’re here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis, who was sitting at the bow, turned to look at us.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Floor 33.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Mission Type – Exploration]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Objective – Search the designated area!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The mission window popped up.
 </p>
 <p>
  A continuation of the exploration from the 32nd floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ding!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [A branch occurs!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The sub-quest is updated!]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…?’
 </p>
 <p>
  [A sub-quest (branch type)]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Objective – Summon the airship!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Reward – Opening of a hidden stage]
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly a sub-quest popped up.

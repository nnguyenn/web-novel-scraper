 <p>
  The objective was even more nonsensical.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not a mission to deal with someone or protect something, but simply to summon the airship.

 <p>
  I had seen and experienced many quests, but this level was rare.
 </p>
 <p>
  The reward was also strange.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hidden stage.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Pick Me Up! was known as a luck-based game for a reason.
 </p>
 <p>
  While a bonus stage might provide hints for the next floor, I had no idea what the hidden stage would entail.
 </p>
 <p>
  One thing was for sure, the difficulty of the mission could significantly rise.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sub-quest? Like the one we did in the desert?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna, looking at the air, said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Summon the airship… The content is simple.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Suspicious, though.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist responded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis approached.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you discussing? Include me as well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just wait. This is our business.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis made a disappointed face and then stepped back.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Would you like to ask for the heroes’ intentions?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes(Selected) / No]

 <p>
  Anytng’s operation window stopped.
 </p>
 <p>
  He seemed to be pondering.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I could make a suggestion, but.’
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s no guarantee it’s the right answer.

 </p>
 <p>
  “What is it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How long has it been since we left land?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Over a month.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A month.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seems we’ve moved quite far from the land.
 </p>
 <p>
  As I remained silent, Anytng’s patience seemed to reach its limit.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Little wizard!]
 </p>
 <p>
  A familiar voice resounded in my head.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was Iselle’s.
 </p>

 <p>
  It was clear that everyone could hear it, as the 1st party looked around.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were looking for Iselle, but she was nowhere to be found.
 </p>
 <p>
  Only the voice continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master has ordered the summoning of the airship.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes, refuse and you know what happens.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio looked at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  What should we do?
 </p>
 <p>
  I shook my head.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘1st Party’s leader, ‘Han(★★★),’ suggests rejecting the sub-quest.]

 <p>
  We can’t leave the strategy to chance.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it’s a sub-quest, there will be plenty of opportunities.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rushing into a decision could lead to disaster.
 </p>
 <p>
  My opposition seemed unexpected to Anytng, and he paused the operations.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do you accept the suggestion?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes(Selected) / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed to relent this time.
 </p>
 <p>
  The suspicious sub-quest ends here.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t the airship maintenance complete? Do we not need to use it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just bear with it a little longer. It’s obviously suspicious.”

 <p>
  “That’s true.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The early incident on the 33rd floor was temporarily resolved.
 </p>
 <p>
  We each found our spots on the ship.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though it was a mission, there wasn’t much to do.
 </p>
 <p>
  Small species like merfolk or sharks couldn’t damage a large warship.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was almost like a time of rest.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Exploration.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I was able to get information about the destination from Priasis.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the end of the ocean, referred to as the Infinite Sea, lies an ancient dragon temple. It seems she saw a scene in a dream where a key was shining there.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That’s convenient.’

  I pulled a net chair onto the deck and sat on it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s nicer than I thought. It would have been good if sister was here too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna lay down next to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you thinking about so deeply, Oppa?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “About the mission.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “All day long, mission, mission. You’re not a machine, why not take a break? It’s a sub-stage. It’s nothing big.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled and said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There are many who laugh it off and end up dead.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But… we’ve done it about 27 times so far, and there weren’t any major crises.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just because there weren’t any crises so far doesn’t mean there won’t be any in the future.”

 <p>
  After all, it’s a game of luck.
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s no guarantee that a difficulty harder than a boss stage won’t appear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though the chances are less than one in a thousand.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’m not betting high either.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just thinking about the 35th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘1st Party’ has entered a special field, ‘Divine Domain’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I got up from the chair.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking around, it wasn’t night yet, but the surroundings had darkened.
 </p>
 <p>
  Black clouds hung heavily in the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna also widened her eyes and turned her gaze.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Special field.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The feeling wasn’t good.
 </p>
 <p>
  I got up from the chair and went inside the ship.
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis’s room was the first on the 1st-floor corridor.
 </p>
 <p>
  I knocked and entered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Pria, sorry, but we have to turn the ship around. The information…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You wish to turn back after trampling our sacred sea with your dirty feet?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria’s eyes were wide open.

  A harsh, grating voice came from her mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is this… mind control?’
 </p>
 <p>
  “Listen, false hero.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis’s mouth moved on its own.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We will not be hunted like other guardians. We will become the hunters. You will pay the price for violating the laws.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Who are you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The hunt begins.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud.
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis collapsed after finishing her words.
 </p>
 <p>
  I quickly approached and supported her.

  “Damn…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Warning!]
 </p>
 <p>
  A warning message flashed before my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  I laid Priasis on the bed and immediately went out to the deck.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, the deck shook violently.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, Oppa!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t know! Suddenly…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  With the sound of an explosion, a giant pillar-like object shot up in a straight line.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Kraken Lv.38]
 </p>
 <p>
  Tentacles that seemed to be several meters long writhed while standing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  Then the second tentacle rose.
 </p>
 <p>
  The third, fourth, fifth…
 </p>
 <p>
  The tentacles wrapped around the ship from all sides.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hundreds of suction cups on each tentacle had blades attached to them.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is insane.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The ship swayed under the weight.
 </p>
 <p>
  If this continues, we’ll be dragged into the water.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Attack the tentacles! Start by cutting off the ones attached to the ship!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I shouted to the members rushing out of the ship.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  I immediately drew my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Kraken’s tentacles were wrapped around the center of the ship.
 </p>
 <p>
  As I gathered all my strength to slash down.
 </p>
 <p>
  Grrroooooooo.
 </p>
 <p>
  A pitiful scream echoed, and the tentacles wrapped around the ship receded into the water.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Senior, what’s going on!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t know!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked down beneath the railing.
 </p>
 <p>
  A huge black shadow was thrashing below the water’s surface.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sky was filled with black clouds.
 </p>
 <p>
  The wind grew stronger.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon, rain began to pour.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s a complete mess.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom! Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  Intense waves surged from the surface of the water.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each wave lightly lifted the ship.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is sudden…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis, having regained her senses, came out to the deck.
 </p>
 <p>
  I pointed to the helm and shouted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Pria, take the wheel. Turn the ship around!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Han, this is…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s no time to explain.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, got it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis rushed to the helm on the deck.
 </p>
 <p>
  She turned it round and round to the right. Creak. The ship slowly began to rotate.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Hahahahahahaha!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  A scraping voice echoed in my head.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the side of the ship, a water column several meters high shot up, and a black figure emerged.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was none other than the Kraken’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, its tentacles were completely torn apart.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  Once again, a water column erupted.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;The hunt begins!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The creature in the air swallowed the Kraken in one bite.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Danger!]

  “Han! What should we do…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Was this a trap mission from the start?’
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as the special field appeared, we should have turned the ship around without looking back.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng will make use of this knowledge in the next missions.
 </p>
 <p>
  But…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There’s no next time for me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I snapped my fingers.

 <p>
  [‘1st Party’ leader, ‘Han(★★★),’ suggests summoning the airship.]

 <p>
  [Do you accept?]
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  Permission was granted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Katiio!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio’s eyes sparkled blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  His hands crossed, and threads of magical power began to emanate.

 </p>
 <p>
  A large eel-like creature leaped from the surface.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a small Water Dragon.

 <p>
  A Mermaid was riding on its back.
 </p>
 <p>
  Leaping dozens of meters like a flying fish, the Water Dragon dropped the fully armed Mermaid onto the deck before diving back into the sea.
 </p>
 <p>
  I lowered my stance and sprinted.
 </p>
 <p>
  In less than a second, I closed a distance of 10m.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swinging my sword, the Mermaid’s upper body was sliced off in one clean cut.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Protect the dimensional gate! Don’t let them touch it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  They were swarming towards Katiio, who was summoning the airship through the dimensional gate.
 </p>
 <p>
  We formed a circle around Katiio to protect him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kyak!”

  A Water Dragon, carrying a Mermaid on its back, was hit by an arrow as it soared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, when the deck was drenched in the blue blood of the Mermaid.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kroong!
 </p>
 <p>
  A different kind of vibration shook the ship.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Let’s see you struggle!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  A tail several meters long soared and swept across the ship horizontally. And then it smashed the sails and mast like wooden chopsticks.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Danger!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Nautilus’ is in critical condition!]
 </p>
 <p>

  Magical threads were weaving a semi-circular gate.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We can’t hold out any longer… Ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Water Dragon’s tail wrapped around a sailor’s upper body.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sailor was dragged into the water.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Nautilus’ high-speed sailing device stopped working.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The ship halted.
 </p>
 <p>
  The deck of the sailing ship was riddled with holes, and all the masts and sails were broken.
 </p>
 <p>
  Water was leaking into the ship.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sailing ship rocked violently up and down, then slowly began to sink.

  Priasis let go of the helm.

 <p>
  “Is it going to end like this again?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Get used to it if you’re planning to stick with me longer.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s true.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis smiled faintly.
 </p>
 <p>
  【Open, the gate of dimensions!】
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio clasped his hands together.
 </p>
 <p>
  Behind the sailing ship, a semi-circular dimensional gate appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [A dimensional gate has been created!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Through the dimensional gate, vehicles, equipment, and consumables can be summoned to the battlefield.]

 <p>

 <p>
  The bow of the Capitalism appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll go ahead.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Teleportation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio turned to look at me, then disappeared in a flash of light.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sailing ship continued to sink from the front.

  I supported Priasis and ran to the back of the ship.
 </p>
 <p>
  Members of the 1st Party chased after the Mermaids nearby.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even if you have several lives, it wouldn’t be enough if we keep fighting like this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I ignored Neryssa’s joke and approached the railing.
 </p>
 <p>
  The fully revealed Capitalism was approaching the sinking ship.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Die, Die all of you!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Crash!
 </p>
 <p>
  The tail struck one side of the ship.
 </p>
 <p>
  Wood splinters flew, and half of the sailing ship was shattered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What about the other sailors…”

 <p>
  I shook my head.
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis silently grabbed my collar.
 </p>
 <p>
  As I boarded last, the sailing ship sank helplessly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thump!
 </p>
 <p>
  A column of water shot up.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Water Dragon, nearly 10m tall, flashed its eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Do you think calling another ship will make a difference?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not a ship, it’s an airship. You anchovy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I raised my middle finger at it.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Capitalism’s high-speed flight device is activated!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Vroom!
 </p>
 <p>
  The airship slightly lifted off the water’s surface.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, like a hovercraft, it sped across the waves.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Flying is impossible, but…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed, an airship is an airship.
 </p>
 <p>
  Its basic specs are different from a simple ship.
 </p>
 <p>
  The steel-covered exterior would not dent from ordinary impacts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, airships are fundamentally equipped with high-speed flight devices.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Summon the airship!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have completed a sub-quest.]

  &lt;Kuaaaaaa!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Leaving the Water Dragon’s roar behind, the Capitalism sped across the sea.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon after, as if nothing had happened, the sea was calm again.
 </p>
 <p>
  A moment of silence followed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unable to hold back, Jenna spoke up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What was that long monster just now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It looked like a dragon. Different from the one we fought on the 20th floor, though.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve heard of it. It’s called a Water God, an ancient species from the deep sea. Back in the early days of the empire…”

  Jenna, Velkist, and Neryssa began to chatter.
 </p>
 <p>
  I wiped the blood off my sword with a cloth and sheathed it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, I sat on the metal deck of the airship.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If it weren’t for the airship, it would have been tough.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It wouldn’t have been a total defeat, but we would have struggled.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Really shitty missions.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Pick Me Up! is known for its high difficulty, but this was something else.
 </p>
 <p>
  If I were the master, I would have complained to customer service by now.
 </p>
 <p>
  In fact, when I was running Niflheimr, I did inquire a few times.
 </p>
 <p>
  Why is the difficulty set like this for my account?
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, the reply was always the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If you don’t like it, quit.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Maybe I should have quit back then.
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled bitterly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anyway…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I murmured and looked to the right of my vision.
 </p>
 <p>
  A message announcing the completion of the sub-quest was displayed.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was almost forced upon us.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A hidden stage, huh.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stage Clear!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han(★★★)’, ‘Jenna(★★★)’, ‘Neryssa(★★★)’ level up!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Reward – 150,000G]
 </p>
 <p>
  [MVP – ‘Jenna(★★★)’]
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ll look into it later.
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s too much to do.
 </p>
 <p>
  The boss of the 35th floor is now confirmed.
 </p>
 <p>
  This time was a bust, but it wasn’t without gains.
 </p>
 <p>
  We’ve learned the basic specs and patterns of the boss. I’ll ask the master for some time, then slowly prepare our strategy.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘We’ll need more than a week.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The 1st Party members haven’t even learned to swim yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seems we’ll need to add underwater combat to our training.
 </p>
 <p>
  But first, we’ll need a swimming pool…
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Water Dragon Ktaart’ is demanding prey.]
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, Anytng’s screen changed.

 <p>
  [You cannot escape the Water God’s domain.]

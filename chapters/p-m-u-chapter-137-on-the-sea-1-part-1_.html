 <p>
  I covered my forehead.
 </p>
 <p>
  A slight headache was coming on.
 </p>

 <p>
  ‘This is a pattern I’ve never seen before.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even I, who had reviewed and analyzed hundreds of missions, was encountering this type for the first time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even Anytng seemed perplexed, as the control window wouldn’t move.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s this now?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna’s scream could be heard.
 </p>
 <p>
  The other members also seemed visibly flustered.
 </p>
 <p>
  The mission was over, but we couldn’t return. And then the next floor started.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Sigh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I took a deep breath.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s okay. There’s always a way, a strategy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Keep calm. If we analyze the rules of the game, there will be a way out.
 </p>
 <p>
  As there always has been.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Gather around!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I called the members of the first party on deck.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll explain the situation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I informed them of our current difficulty.
 </p>
 <p>
  We had summoned the airship, and by clearing a sub-quest, we had been dragged into a hidden mission. The rules of the Hidden Stage were slightly different from the usual missions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So we’re trapped here because of that Hidden mission thingy?”

 <p>
  “That’s right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Such an annoying mission.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s no easy way out, huh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Everyone grumbled, yet their expressions didn’t change.
 </p>
 <p>
  We had all experienced situations like this countless times. We were past the stage of panicking like children.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, Han!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio rushed out from the cockpit.
 </p>
 <p>
  Panic was evident in his expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it. I’m coming.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I said, looking at Priasis standing around like a sack of rice.

 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I entered the cockpit with Katiio.
 </p>
 <p>
  An unfamiliar shape was floating above the hologram of the dashboard.
 </p>
 <p>
  A blue square.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the center was a red circle, with black dots around the outside.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the right edge, a ship was drawn.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tips!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The red circle represents the detection area of the water dragon. It will expand over time.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The black dots indicate the presence of hidden items. There are multiple points of interest.]

 </p>
 <p>
  A series of instructions popped up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What in the world is this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It means we have to carry out the mission according to these rules.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I took a closer look at the minimap.
 </p>
 <p>
  The red circle in the center was very slowly expanding its range.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s not that bad.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed we could hold out for at least a few days.
 </p>
 <p>
  I calmed myself down.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  The process had changed slightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  We are now going to prepare for the strategy inside the mission instead of in the waiting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was a set time, and a few restrictions, but other than that, it wasn’t much different.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was even the advantage of being able to gather information about the boss.
 </p>
 <p>
  Previously, we could only get information upon entering the boss stage.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, the ‘Capitalism’ has become a temporary base for the mission!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The facilities onboard are lacking. Please expand them!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng immediately began to move his control window.
 </p>
 <p>
  The interior structure of the airship and the control window appeared on the screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Capitalism, spanning three floors, was empty except for the core facilities.
 </p>

 <p>
  [‘Lodgings Lv.1’ selected. Do you wish to construct this facility?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes(Select) / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzing.
 </p>
 <p>
  The space next to us split open, and Iselle popped out.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Cute fairy, Iselle appears!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle did a spin in the air and then looked at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  [As expected, you’re caught up in this.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you know?”
 </p>

 <p>
  [A bit.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle sighed and continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Anyway! Now that it’s a temporary base, I can be active here too. I plan to assist with the operation of the airship until we clear the mission. First of all!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle pointed a finger at Katiio.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Katiio, open a portal in section B-7 on the second floor! The supplies for the lodgings will be brought in.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Lodging supplies?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Well, the rooms are empty. You have to put in beds, desks, and all that kind of stuff. You’re not planning to sleep on the floor, are you?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio looked at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Go and open it. She’s not wrong.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…It’s not a big deal.”
 </p>

 <p>
  Katiio grumbled as he left the cockpit with Iselle.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tips!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Building facilities for the airship requires different materials than in the waiting room.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [For ‘Lodgings Lv.1’: 50 gems and lower-level or higher-quality beds, desks, and chairs.]
 </p>
 <p>
  After a while.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Good!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Capitalism’s section B-7 now has lodgings.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The efficiency of the heroes’ rest increases.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A temporary base.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A term used in long-term missions, also known as ‘business trips.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the regional map again. The water dragon’s detection area had hardly moved.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Maybe… more than a week.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I peeked at Anytng’s control window.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the top was the airship, and at the bottom, the map of the waiting room was spread out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng was directing the carpenters in the workshop to make furniture.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If we’re talking about a necessary facility…’
 </p>
 <p>
  A hologram window popped up.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘First party’s leader, ‘Han(★★★)’, suggests.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Facility Summon – Training Ground]
 </p>
 <p>
  Ordering a facility strictly for combat preparation.

 <p>
  Anytng prepared for the next summons.
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, the facility to be built was a training ground. On the left side of the third floor of Capitalism, there was a large hall.
 </p>
 <p>
  The empty hall was filled with wooden dummies, practice weapons, and a swimming pool full of water.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Good!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Capitalism’s section C-2 now has a training ground.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Special training at the temporary base is possible!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng continued the facility summons.
 </p>
 <p>
  The items needed for the summon had been prepared in advance.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Good!]
 </p>
 <p>

 <p>
  [‘Capitalism’s section B-1 now has a waiting area!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [It is now possible to replenish and replace heroes in battle.]
 </p>
 <p>
  By evening, the interior of the airship was somewhat filled.
 </p>
 <p>
  I called the other members, excluding Katiio who was working, once again.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So… this airship is now in a similar state to the waiting room?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Think of it as a kind of war base.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Everyone caught on quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no need for detailed explanations.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Next.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I spread out a paper on the deck.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a map modeled after the hologram map in the cockpit.
 </p>
 <p>
  The red circle in the center was the boss’s territory. The black dots on the outskirts were the points of interest.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Once the basic preparations are done, we’ll circle the outside, capturing the points of interest. We don’t have much leeway, so we’ll probably start tomorrow.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is there any benefit to capturing these points?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We can get special items.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I could guess what kind of items they were.
 </p>
 <p>
  Things that couldn’t be made at the current stage.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Mermaid’s Tears.’

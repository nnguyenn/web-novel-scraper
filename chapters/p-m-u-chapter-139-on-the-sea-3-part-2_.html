 <p>
  It took us two days to arrive at the last base.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, the red circle indicating the water dragon’s territory had swallowed more than half of the map.
 </p>

 <p>
  And there was a slight anomaly at the fourth base.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Baby Water Dragon Lv.37] X 7
 </p>
 <p>
  Several black shadows were roaming near the island.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s handle it with the ballista…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I interrupted Katiio’s suggestion.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Call Jenna.”
 </p>
 <p>
  On her belt hung a crossbow the size of a pistol.
 </p>
 <p>
  The equipment arrived yesterday after going through modifications. The armor and undergarments were waterproofed, and various weapons were transformed into streamlined forms.
 </p>
 <p>
  My current level in underwater combat was 3.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna was also at level 3, while Velkist and Neryssa were at levels 1 and 2, respectively.
 </p>
 <p>
  The two were still not quite ready for real combat, but Jenna and I were sufficient.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you call me, Oppa?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Look over there.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There are monsters.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna’s eyes sparkled as she looked at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They seem like a worthy opponent!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right, let’s not touch the treasure box for now. Let’s deal with the surrounding small fry first.”

 <p>
  “Roger that!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What about support magic?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re good.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I blinked at Katiio, who was left behind and filled my lungs with oxygen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Splash!
 </p>
 <p>
  I dove into the water.
 </p>
 <p>
  After adjusting to the underwater vision, I immediately kicked off and advanced.
 </p>
 <p>
  The 2m-sized water dragons had spotted us.
 </p>
 <p>
  They immediately bared their teeth and began to approach.
 </p>
 <p>
  I signaled to Jenna behind me.

 <p>
  Jenna nodded and then clenched her fists.
 </p>
 <p>
  She pushed off with her toes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her body shot forward at high speed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…It’s different from on land.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The most significant characteristic of underwater combat is that it introduces an above-and-below aspect to the fight.
 </p>
 <p>
  Additionally, you’re inevitably slower than on land. It was important to secure a favorable position in advance and move accordingly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sshh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna’s arrow grazed by.
 </p>
 <p>
  I drew my sword and spun my body.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thunk.

 <p>
  I plunged the sword into the roof of a water dragon’s mouth as it opened wide.
 </p>
 <p>
  Turning my head, I saw a water dragon writhing with an arrow lodged in it. I immediately tore through the dragon’s throat.
 </p>
 <p>
  The blue sea turned red with blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  The destructive power wasn’t as strong as on land, but the lethality was sufficient.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seven minutes.
 </p>
 <p>
  The time I could hold my breath underwater.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was initially three minutes, but I gradually extended it through diving training.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks to swinging my sword thousands of times underwater, I also gained some know-how.
 </p>
 <p>
  When about half of the oxygen in my lungs was used up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Phew.”

 <p>
  I raised my head above the water.
 </p>
 <p>
  Below, the bodies of the baby water dragons were sinking.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s not as efficient as I thought.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The speed wasn’t quite there.
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to the water dragon, it was almost laughable.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not to mention turning directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘As expected.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled bitterly and brought the chest from the island.

  [Dimensional Summoning Stone]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Grade: B+]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Allows summoning heroes from the waiting room to the airship.]

  It summons heroes from the waiting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Simple in function, but perhaps the most crucial item.
 </p>
 <p>
  I surveyed the sea.
 </p>
 <p>
  The red circle had consumed more than seven-tenths of the map.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, congratulations on gathering all the items!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Touch the ‘Start Hunting’ icon at the bottom of the screen to begin the boss stage.]
 </p>
 <p>
  It seems we’re somewhat prepared fundamentally.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the battle preparations were not yet completely finished.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng closed the guidance window and entered the operation tab of the waiting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seems he’s not yet ready to challenge.
 </p>
 <p>
  That night, I called everyone except Priasis.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ve gathered all the items.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I laid out the four items and explained their uses.
 </p>
 <p>
  The mermaid’s tears, which enable underwater breathing.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Deep Sea Ship Model, which summons a combat vessel to the battlefield.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Oxygen Supply Device, which recharges the oxygen of a hero in an underwater breathing state.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dimensional Summoning Stone, which summons heroes from the waiting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Will this be enough?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We have to try. That’s why we gathered them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I continued.

 <p>
  “To be frank, the four of us on our own can’t take that monster down.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The original plan was to include Katiio with the four of us to face the water dragon.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the wide range of support magic a wizard possesses, there were useful ones even underwater.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, with Katiio handling the airship, inevitably, there was a flaw in the party composition.
 </p>
 <p>
  “When the master logs in tomorrow, we’ll use this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I held out the glowing blue stone.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the Dimensional Summoning Stone.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We can’t summon another party yet. Only exchange is possible. So, one of you will temporarily switch places with Eloka until we enter the 35th floor.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Eloka?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, she will be useful.”
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-15" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  If Eloka couldn’t demonstrate her abilities, we’d have to hand over the airship to a mechanic and use Katiio instead.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that okay?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve already spoken to her.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll go back to the waiting room.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa raised her hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that okay with you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, I have things to do there.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa responded without hesitation.
 </p>
 <p>
  After a bit of thought, I agreed.
 </p>
 <p>
  After all, once the subjugation begins, Katiio will move to another party, and Neryssa will return.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the next evening came.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I knew it would come to this. It’s only natural.”
 </p>
 <p>
  On the third floor of the airship, in the waiting area.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka muttered as she stood on the magic circle.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I just took a short break! And now it’s the glorious return of the genius magician, haha! You must have deeply felt how important I am!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you learn to swim?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ve mastered the fourth tier of fire magic, right? The one that explodes inside the enemy. It seems like it could work underwater. And underwater combat. Magic is not unaffected either. I should have mentioned this. Of course.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, that… I worked hard, but there was just too much…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then we’ll have to send you back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait, just give me a day! Just one day! That’s right!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t be scared. I was joking.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I laughed lightly.

 <p>
  A total of twelve skills.
 </p>
 <p>
  Three related to weapon skills. Three related to mental abilities. Two resistances. Three auxiliary skills. And one extra.

 <p>
  ‘It’s not good.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Skills that could synergize were leveling up independently.
 </p>
 <p>
  Choosing a great sword over a shield wasn’t just for show.
 </p>
 <p>
  A one-strike sword technique focused on destructive power. I had decided on my concept early on and developed myself accordingly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Heavenly Sword Spirit and Power Strike.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Both skills were about adding destructive power onto sword attacks.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, they didn’t combine.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Composure and Frenzy.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Since the 5th floor, it has been the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  They had powerful effects, but the downside was a weakening of weapon skills.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Insight and Invincible go without saying.’
 </p>
 <p>
  When two skills perfectly combine, the effect improvement doesn’t end at double.
 </p>
 <p>
  It will be at least triple the original effect. If more synergy is created, it could go up to ten times or more.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is called breaking the limit.
 </p>
 <p>
  Limit breaking is an essential process that lower-tier heroes must undergo to surpass the domain of higher-tier heroes. It was the part I paid the most attention to when training heroes. If done correctly, it could overpower the difference in stats.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There’s no problem with the calculations…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Long ago, the blueprint for ‘Han Israt’ was completed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although several problematic issues were overcome with the help of Niflheimr, the most crucial awakening had not occurred. Initially, I thought time would solve it, but…

 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  I swung my sword again.
 </p>
 <p>
  The water split violently to the sides, creating waves across the entire swimming pool.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘As expected, it can’t be done like this.’
 </p>
 <p>
  At this rate, I’d just be a slightly more talented 1-star Hero.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no way I could reach the five from Niflheimr.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  After countless battles and training, if there was still something lacking…
 </p>
 <p>
  I swung my sword tirelessly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, Oppa? Eek!”

 <p>
  Jenna stumbled.
 </p>
 <p>
  She had entered the training ground entrance and got hit by a splash of water.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why are you scooping water out of the pool with your sword?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s late. Aren’t you going to sleep?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I smirked and threw a towel to her side.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna caught the towel and started drying her wet hair.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I couldn’t sleep, so I thought I’d practice a bit more. What about you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “As you can see. I’m training.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t that enough? You’re already at the level of a human weapon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A human weapon, you say.”
 </p>

 <p>
  Jenna continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Swinging a sword to deflect ballistas, slicing through thick iron, and scooping pool water with a swing, if that’s not a weapon, what is?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This isn’t enough.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I shook my head.
 </p>
 <p>
  To survive, I’m far from the goals I’ve set for myself.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How much stronger do you intend to become? Consider our feelings man, we’re trying to keep up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s for you to handle.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I straightened my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  The practice wasn’t over yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  To clear my complicated thoughts, I planned to swing my sword throughout the night.

 <p>
  “Hmm.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna seemed to ponder something, then swiftly jumped to my side.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems like you’re troubled. Tell me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s because I’m weak. Satisfied?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow, such deceit… I can understand how Aaron felt.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna sat down next to me, pressing her hip against mine.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then she grinned and looked up at me, settling in as if she planned to stay.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I decided to stop for a bit.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps Jenna could provide a clue to break through the wall.
 </p>

 <p>
  Jenna had exceptional insight and understanding. And,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘More importantly…’
 </p>
 <p>
  This little had already combined skills.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna had acquired the special skill Side Winder, a combination of Weak Point Detection and Rapid Fire.
 </p>
 <p>
  And she was aware of my skill situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ….
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, so you think the conditions are right, but the skills aren’t combining.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After listening to my explanation, Jenna clapped her hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The synergy just isn’t there.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Maybe because you’re not in the same situation as when you obtained the skills?”
 </p>

 <p>
  “When I obtained them?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, like, that time on the 5th floor?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I narrowed my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  The situation when I obtained Frenzy.
 </p>
 <p>
  The 5th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a mission to survive against thousands of goblins.
 </p>
 <p>
  I barely survived, fighting to the brink of death.
 </p>
 <p>
  “At that time, Oppa, you were, how should I say, extremely…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Extremely, what?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Filled with madness? It was like a do-or-die situation.”
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-12" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 </div>
 <p>
  “That’s right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But now, I don’t really get that feeling watching you. You seem more calm?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, I’m more experienced now, and I’ve mastered a lot of other skills.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After the 5th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Precisely, after the 15th floor, there weren’t any critical crises.
 </p>
 <p>
  The 20th, 25th, and up to the 30th floor. All were missions I could clear without much difficulty with my power.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Oppa from before fought more fiercely, but now you feel more like a strategy machine. No matter what situation arises, you handle it coolly! Since it’s a mental skill, maybe that aspect is affecting it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s a tall order.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I gave a bitter smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna’s advice wasn’t much different from my analysis.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking back to the 317 cases of limit breaking in Niflheimr, 245 were during battles, 55 during training, and 17 were other cases.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Force a crisis situation, is that what you’re saying?’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was an option I hadn’t considered even when I was a master.
 </p>
 <p>
  Regardless of how talented a hero was, I didn’t want to push a party to the brink of extinction just to focus on one person. Now that I’m a hero, even more so.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna’s advice, though new to me, who had only thought of training from a master’s perspective, was just that, nothing more.
 </p>
 <p>
  Analyze the hero’s talent and traits, then train the appropriate type of skills.
 </p>
 <p>
  That was the extent of my involvement in training as a master.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether the flower blooms or withers away is up to them.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…’
 </p>
 <p>
  There must be another way.
 </p>

 <p>
  I decided to think about it gradually.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Does the environment when first obtaining the skill influence later awakenings?’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was time to verify if Jenna’s words were correct.
 </p>
 <p>
  A fresh theory. If I had still been a master, I would have prepared for experiments immediately.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, was it helpful?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna tilted her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not that it’s not helpful. Though it’s hard to say if it will be helpful.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Eh, what’s that? So vague.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We are already fighting fiercely. What more can we do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I said with a laugh.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-15" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 </div>
 <p>
  Being calm meant being efficient.
 </p>
 <p>
  It meant looking at the situation broadly.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was the optimal survival method I had developed through missions.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no intention to change my combat style now.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  The third sword strike.
 </p>
 <p>
  The column of water shot up high.

  The ‘Start Hunting’ button at the bottom of the screen was flashing white.

 <p>
  [Building the field.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Splash!
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, the ship shook violently.
 </p>
 <p>
  The waves had grown taller.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s started.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We can do it. Let’s all return alive.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the waves slowly pushed the non-aerial ship into the deeper part of the sea,
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Did you think you could run away forever?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  I touched the space behind the ship.
 </p>
 <p>
  My hand was gently pushed back. A transparent wall was surrounding the field.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Katiio.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll take the helm for now.”

 </p>
 <p>
  Kwooooooo!
 </p>
 <p>
  From afar, the water dragon with red eyes roared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Water Dragon Ktaart’ roars!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Kwoong!
 </p>
 <p>
  The sea churned, and the water rose several meters high as if a wall had been erected in the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;The true hunt begins!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  With towering waves, it started to approach.
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  I quickly scanned the mission window and shouted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Everyone, to your positions!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist ran to the left side of the deck.
 </p>
 <p>
  A rapid-fire ballista was installed on the left railing.
 </p>
 <p>
  I ran to the right.
 </p>
 <p>
  The same device was there. I grabbed the aiming device and placed my hand on the trigger.

 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  Within the waves, countless shadows flickered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Vroom!
 </p>
 <p>
  The non-aerial ship half rose from the water.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hold tight!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Then it began to climb the waves.
 </p>

  I braced my feet on the railing to maintain balance.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kraaaaa!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I pulled the trigger.
 </p>
 <p>
  A giant arrow lodged into the torso of a merman.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Avoid them as much as possible. We need to find the statue first!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You don’t even have to say it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The ship slid on the tidal waves.
 </p>
 <p>
  The angle of the deck steeply tilted.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna fixed her feet in the grooves of the deck.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pulling the bowstring, an arrow lodged into the forehead of a water dragon.

 <p>
  “That was the plan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist began firing.
 </p>
 <p>
  With each shot, gears moved, automatically loading the next arrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;This will be your grave!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  A large figure leaped from beside the wave.
 </p>
 <p>
  It opened its mouth. A water cannon. A pattern I had seen several times before.
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio quickly turned the steering wheel. The water cannon shot past us.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Eloka is….’
 </p>
 <p>
  Holding the railing tightly, she watched over us.

  She was conserving her magic for when she needed to attack.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thwack!
 </p>
 <p>
  The ballista tore through both a water dragon and mermen at the same time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Reload. Fire again. And reload once more. I held the aiming device and continuously pulled the trigger.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Where’s the object?’
 </p>
 <p>
  This mission wouldn’t stand without the goddess statue.
 </p>
 <p>
  While pulling the trigger, I diligently scanned the sea.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;This is my domain!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Capitalism sailed around the water dragon, climbing against the waves.
 </p>
 <p>
  A few mermen that clung to the side of the ship fell as the ship changed direction.

  “We’re good so far!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ping! Ping! Ping! Ping!
 </p>
 <p>
  I was on the right, Velkist on the left.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna covered any gaps.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ship crested the wave and descended on the other side.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;You will die!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  A water cannon grazed over the ship.
 </p>
 <p>
  He’s such a whiner.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oppa, over there!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As we descended to the surface, Jenna pointed upwards.
 </p>
 <p>
  I followed her finger with my gaze. Something was shining at the end of the receding wave.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems to be at the top?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Seriously.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Should we turn the ship?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No need for that. It’ll come back on its own.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The wave at the edge of the field suddenly began to return in the opposite direction, easily ignoring the flow of water.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It really did.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Katiio, get ready.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I let go of the aiming device.

  Arrows were limited. There was no need to waste them in a preliminary skirmish.

  The ship again rode the waves upwards.

  ‘The number has actually increased.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite having dealt with so many.
 </p>
 <p>
  I rested my hand on the hilt of my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio came out onto the deck.
 </p>

 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng had watched us several times.
 </p>
 <p>
  He knew what needed to be done.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ship began to slowly slide on the wave.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Be careful.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I will.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio waved his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Magic threads spewed from his fingertips, gently wrapping around my entire body.
 </p>
 <p>
  A strange sensation of floating enveloped my body.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just draw its attention and break away. I’ll retrieve the goddess statue.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll cover you as much as I can.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No need.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled and leaped over the railing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ripples spread from my toes, and my body rose above the water.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kraaaaa!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Mermen immediately sprang forth.
 </p>
 <p>
  I lowered my posture and moved my hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  The water split and the merman’s neck burst with blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  Another one. I swung my sword. A water dragon carrying mermen was split in two, spewing blood and entrails.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you looking at?! Go the other way!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, got it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Capitalism began to distance itself.
 </p>
 <p>
  I dashed across the water.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I just need to be careful of attacks from below.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I leaped high over the waves.
 </p>
 <p>
  The jaws of a water dragon, filled with serrated teeth, snapped at where I had been.
 </p>
 <p>
  Landing, I slashed behind me. The dragon was split apart with the waves.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  With each swing of my sword, water columns erupted, and blood and flesh fluttered in the wind.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nearby, the corpses of monsters surfaced. They would soon be swallowed by the flow of the waves and sink.
 </p>
 <p>
  I surged against the waves, accelerating.
 </p>
 <p>
  A goddess statue in a swimsuit, wearing a round tube, was bobbing on the waves.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Are you kidding me?’
 </p>
 <p>
  A surge of irritation rose, but I suppressed it.
 </p>
 <p>
  The statue was glowing blue. It was clearly an important object.
 </p>
 <p>
  I tore through every monster in my path.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Krak, mon, monster….”
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack.
 </p>
 <p>
  I planted my sword into the forehead of a merman, half torn apart, floundering.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then I embraced the modest-sized goddess statue.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘On vacation, are we?’
 </p>
 <p>
  [This is a placeable object.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Insert it at a suitable location.]

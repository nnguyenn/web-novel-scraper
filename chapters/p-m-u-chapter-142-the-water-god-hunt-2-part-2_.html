  “Farmer sir, let’s give it our all again!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lyman showed me a fist bump and disappeared into the ship.

  “The boarding is complete!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Screech.
 </p>
 <p>
  The airship began to move forward, leaving the goddess statue behind.

  [Warning!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Manual operation of the airship is now impossible!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Eloka, stop.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka staggered back, caught by Jenna.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you okay?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Someway or another.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna took out a blue potion and brought it to Eloka’s mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gulp, gulp.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Roar! These wretches!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  The water dragon leaped tens of meters into the air riding a column of water.
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  A blue energy gathered in the monster’s mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  But this time, the target was not the airship.

  Although the wooden ship’s mast broke in the center, but it managed to evade the hydro cannon.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s move.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I took out a small cylinder from my belt pouch and approached the swaying goddess statue. There was a hole near its bottom.

  Inside the small glass bottle, a translucent white liquid was contained.

  Five bottles in total. They were mermaid’s tears.

  Monsters from all over the field began to converge.

 <p>
  Their target was the direction where the goddess statue was installed.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;It’s okay, Han. It won’t be like last time. We’ll definitely stop them.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis’s voice reached me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled and replied, “I trust you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Mhm.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  I brought my hand to my ear.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no longer a need to communicate.

  The airship reached the middle of the waters.

  “Yes.”

  A small glass bottle containing a white liquid.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mermaid’s tears. I made it since we had the ingredients. There’s only one bottle, though.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A spare, just in case.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed unlikely we’d need it, but I put the potion in my pouch.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Splash!
 </p>
 <p>
  We dived into the water.
 </p>
 <p>
  Amidst the boiling bubbles, the water dragon’s red eyes glinted menacingly.
 </p>
 <p>
  I spread my palm, signaling to form up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Me and Velkist at the front, Neryssa and Jenna in the middle, Eloka at the rear.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took a deep breath.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sweet air filled my lungs.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s start.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I drew my Bifrost sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, I kicked off to the left and advanced.
 </p>
 <p>
  The water dragon’s forelimb swung at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘We’ll block it from the front.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka’s chanting had already begun.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, we couldn’t let the water dragon go easily. I gripped the sword hilt tightly and slashed upward.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!

 <p>
  The claw and the sword blade collided.
 </p>
 <p>
  A heavy sound followed, and I was flung backward.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, Velkist thrust his sword between the dragon’s scales.
 </p>
 <p>
  Red blood scattered from between the scales.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘We’re inflicting damage.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Everything was going as planned.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was to first block the dragon’s charge, followed by Velkist, then Neryssa, and finally, Jenna would stop the dragon. Meanwhile,
 </p>
 <p>
  【…!】
 </p>
 <p>
  Flames danced in Eloka’s eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Near the dragon’s chest, bubbles began to rise.

  Flames erupted.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flesh and blood dispersed in the water.
 </p>
 <p>
  The water dragon writhed in agony.
 </p>
 <p>
  I held up two fingers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Attack all at once. Velkist pushed me from behind.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gaining momentum, I struck at the wriggling dragon’s neck. Jenna followed with an arrow, and Neryssa pulled her crossbow.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Rawr!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The dragon thrashed violently.
 </p>
 <p>
  The surging water pushed me away, but I was accustomed to resisting the flow from practice.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s not difficult.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If only we could know in advance that this boss would appear, it might even be easier than other levels.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ktaart casts ‘Triple Hydro Cannon’!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Blue magic gathered in the dragon’s mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  The target was Eloka, who was preparing magic. I quickly turned back.
 </p>
 <p>
  After taking a deep breath and gathering strength throughout my body,
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  A hydro cannon shot out from the dragon’s mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  I positioned my sword in front, managing to deflect the first hydro cannon. Velkist blocked the second, and Neryssa and Jenna cooperated to stop the third.
 </p>
 <p>
  【…!】
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  The dragon’s tail was severed in an explosion.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps the aim was off, but it was certainly hit.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sliced through the dragon’s fins as I passed by.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘We’ll finish it off this way.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If the initial magic hit its mark.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before it could recover, we would attack all at once to end it quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  After retrieving the key, the mission would be complete.
 </p>
 <p>
  I approached the water’s surface, passing by the dragon.
 </p>
 <p>
  The other parties were struggling against the monsters. As Edis had assured, there was no significant crisis. Even the 3rd Party, prone to seasickness, was performing well on board.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is all it takes.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I dove deep again and approached the dragon.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was coiled up, silently.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…?’
 </p>
 <p>
  What is he doing?
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka was casting magic.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he leaves her alone, he might suffer a fatal wound.
 </p>
 <p>
  【…!】
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka’s third flame magic.
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, no explosion occurred. Instead, the dragon’s chest swelled visibly. Flames churned inside it.
 </p>
 <p>
  The dragon moved towards the surface.
 </p>
 <p>
  I followed with my sword ready.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it tried to flee, I would finish it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  The dragon leaped, scattering a column of water.
 </p>
 <p>
  Its jaws opened wide.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ktaart casts ‘Hydro Cannon’!]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A hydro cannon?’
 </p>
 <p>
  This is…!
 </p>
 <p>
  I clenched my teeth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Edis!”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Han?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Turn the ship, now!”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;If it’s a hydro cannon, we can avoid…&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Flames spewed from the dragon’s mouth, grazing the distant ship’s side.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Ah.’

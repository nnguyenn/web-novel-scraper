 <p>
  Light entered the corridor.
 </p>
 <p>
  The walls and floor were made of bluish stone, with nothing but white lights illuminating the space. There were neither the complex traps one might expect nor any vicious monsters appearing. The only occurrence was the echoing of our footsteps with each step taken.

  “There’s not much time left.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  A piece of stone crumbled and fell.
 </p>
 <p>
  The water dragon was destroying the temple.
 </p>
 <p>
  If this continued, the temple would be submerged along with the key.
 </p>
 <p>
  I hastened my pace.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka followed in rhythm.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Listen closely.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Turning around, I met Eloka’s gaze.
 </p>
 <p>
  She was tense, but she seemed to be trying to calm herself.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re the only ones left here. If a battle breaks out, I can’t protect you perfectly by myself. You’ll need to protect yourself. Can you do it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Protect myself, got it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Use magic for quick attacks and keep your body safe. If you feel in danger, you can rely on me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I won’t rely on you. I can do my part.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka looked at me with determined eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was about to say something but then closed my mouth. We had no choice but to keep moving.
 </p>
 <p>
  “A dungeon for a five-person raid.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Originally, this place should have been entered after dealing with the water dragon, fully prepared.

 <p>
  However, a minor incident twisted all plans, and we were on the brink of annihilation. If Eloka and I failed, it would be the end. We had used up the Mermaid’s Tears. There was no more time to spare.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  The ceiling crumbled, blocking our path.
 </p>
 <p>
  I lightly jumped over the stone and reached out my hand to Eloka.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka grabbed my hand and came over.
 </p>
 <p>
  Minutes passed in what seemed like an endless corridor until the scene suddenly changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Step.
 </p>
 <p>
  I stepped forward with my hand on the hilt of my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  A large circular chamber lay before us, bathed in a blue light. Large stone pillars were placed at regular intervals throughout the space.

  “We’ve found it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka pressed her lips tightly together.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shring. I drew my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  A shadow that had been squirming behind a pillar emerged.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Corrupted Merman Lv.41] X 5
 </p>
 <p>
  Five of them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Their eyes were degenerated, and their skin color was unnaturally pale.
 </p>
 <p>
  They stood about 3 meters tall, considerably bulkier than a normal merman.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Gurgle, gurr…”
 </p>

 <p>
  The merman approached with a boiling sound, wielding rusty swords and spears.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Remember what I said?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Quick attacks, avoid danger if necessary.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I nodded, gripping my sword tightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Screaaaaam!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The merman rushed forward with a tearing scream.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang! I blocked the massive axe blade. The force was numbing. I gritted my teeth and deflected it. I turned my body, landing a spinning slash. A heavy impact traveled through my body, and the upper half of the merman’s body flew into the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  Black blood and entrails poured out.
 </p>
 <p>
  【Draste Siradus!】

 <p>
  The merman slipped on the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka’s magic followed.
 </p>
 <p>
  【Burn!】
 </p>
 <p>
  Flames roared!
 </p>
 <p>
  Flames erupted from Eloka’s hands, engulfing the fallen merman.
 </p>
 <p>
  The merman screamed in agony, writhing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Always be aware of your surroundings!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I moved quickly, launching forward and swinging my sword. The blade sank into the neck of a merman attempting to stab Eloka. As I pulled my hand back, the severed head slid off diagonally.
 </p>
 <p>
  The five mermen fell without a trace.
 </p>
 <p>
  But then,

 </p>
 <p>
  More of them appeared from behind the pillars.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where’s the exit?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The entrance we came through closed upon our arrival, and the doorway on the opposite wall remained shut.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do we have to defeat them all?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Squeeeeeak!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The merman screamed bizarrely, swinging its weapons.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang! I deflected the blade with my left forearm guard, then plunged my hand into its eye. As I pulled out, the eyeball came out along with the optic nerve.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh!”

 <p>
  In a flash, I drew a dagger and stabbed it into the eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  I felt the sensation of stirring the brain. The creature collapsed lifelessly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Eloka(★★★)’ is now in a bleeding state. Health will decrease over time.]
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked over.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka’s dress was torn, and blood was flowing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m okay!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thump!
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka clutched the hem of her dress and kicked the approaching merman.
 </p>
 <p>
  A fireball she had conjured smashed directly into the creature’s face.

  “I am doing so!”

  I shook off my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Black blood sprayed. Ten corpses lay on the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  The second wave was cleared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Gurgle, gasp, squeak…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Corrupted Merman Lv.43] X 5
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The third wave.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I would have preferred traps or puzzles. Those can be solved intellectually.
 </p>
 <p>
  But this was a pure test of strength, and even here, misfortune played its part. I clenched my teeth.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han(★★★)’ is now in a bleeding state. Health will decrease over time.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The last creature nicked my side as it fell.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no time to take a potion. I roughly tied up my clothes and continued the fight.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Corrupted Merman Lv.43] X 8
 </p>
 <p>
  As holes in the walls opened, creatures poured out in succession.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bodies began to pile up under my feet. At the same time, my injuries increased. We had already exhausted a lot of our strength in underwater combat, and with just the two of us, it was impossible to form any strategy.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Eloka(★★★)’ has entered a state of magical overdrive.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Eloka! Stick to the wall!”

 <p>
  A merman’s harpoon snapped.
 </p>
 <p>
  I pushed forward, my blade slicing from the creature’s shoulder down to its lower body. After kicking the corpse aside, I retreated to the wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Corrupted Merman Lv.43] X 21
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Such brute force…!’
 </p>
 <p>
  They were swarming from all directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just overwhelming us with their numbers.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Eloka(★★★)’ is in a critical state. Her life is in danger!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, you bastards! Have you no conscience?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I shouted as I swung my sword, cutting through the mermen like they were straw.
 </p>
 <p>
  Their blood, entrails, flesh, and weapons were scattered everywhere.

 </p>
 <p>
  I advanced, clearing the corpses.
 </p>
 <p>
  I swung my weapon. And swung again.
 </p>
 <p>
  My vision darkened. I wiped the blood from my face and swung my sword again until everything went black.
 </p>
 <p>
  And after a while,
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Ah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I took a deep breath.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nearly a hundred mermen lay before me, all dead.
 </p>
 <p>
  The black blood they spilled formed pools before me.
 </p>
 <p>
  As I wiped my sword blade with a rag, it quickly turned into a useless cloth. I threw it away.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘She needs healing.’

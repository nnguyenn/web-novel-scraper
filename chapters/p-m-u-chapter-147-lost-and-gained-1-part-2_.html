 <p>
  I got up, planning tomorrow’s schedule.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Loki! I have news… Whoa!]
 </p>

 <p>
  Iselle, who appeared beside me, screamed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Why are you covered in blood? And why is the room such a mess again!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Training.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [What kind of training leads to this!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “This isn’t the first time you see me like this. What’s up?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I casually tidied up the room and sheathed my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle coughed a few times before looking at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Remember, you told me to let you know if the master uploads a strategy video.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did I say that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I remember clearly. So, I’ve been watching MyTube daily with my eagle’s eye.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did Anytng upload a video?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  [He did upload. Except for the 35th floor.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “He left out the 35th floor?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes, he downloaded it but…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng began recording videos from the 15th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  That meant he uploaded videos of the 15th and 20th floors, but skipped the 35th. It had been a massive loss. Still, given the intensity, it could have been a popular video.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Anyway, I’ll show you.]

  Iselle gestured in a circle with her arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Haah! Fairy power!]
 </p>
 <p>
  A light gathered in the right side of my vision, conjuring an internet window.
 </p>
 <p>
  A red rectangle with a play triangle. The icon of MyTube.
 </p>
 <p>
  I navigated to Anytng’s channel using the cursor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sure enough.
 </p>
 <p>
  New photos and videos had been uploaded. I tapped on the first video.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Han Israt – Conquering the 15th and 20th Floors&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The video was nothing special.
 </p>
 <p>
  It showed the conquest of the 15th and 20th floors.

  └ &lt;Reply – BusHeadSmasher&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s possible. This person only knows how to ride the bus and does nothing else. Even if the hero performs well, there’s a limit to it.]

 </p>
 <p>
  [Agree. It’s fun but the balance is trash. If I had drawn that character, I’d have reached floor 50 by now. Is this even a game!]

  [Such a waste of a hero. Picked the wrong master. I’d be too embarrassed to upload if it were me. He dosn’t even have Tactical Center yet. Just watching. Do something man. If you can’t handle it, sell it or something. I’ll buy it for a high price.]
 </p>
 <p>
  I scrolled down through the comments.
 </p>
 <p>
  The reactions could be condensed into three main points.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hurry up and upload the next video. Really lucky. And lastly, ‘such a waste of a hero.’

 <p>
  Towards the latter part of the comments, the majority opinion was that the hero was too good for his master.
 </p>
 <p>
  What are you doing in the back? Why wave those useless light sticks? Why take screenshots? After a few passionate instigations, the comment section became nearly toxic with personal attacks.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ha! Stupid people. They’re just jealous. They’re jealous because they don’t have a hero like Loki.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle puffed up her cheeks.
 </p>
 <p>
  Was the ID Lollipop?
 </p>
 <p>
  Though it was a hard-hitting truth bomb.
 </p>
 <p>
  The purpose behind posting the comment seemed somewhat petty.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Doing nothing in the back.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t incorrect. While a master couldn’t directly intervene in missions, they could influence in other ways.
 </p>
 <p>
  Tactical Center.

  A facility through which a master could get involved in missions.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, this was a double-edged sword. I’ve seen dozens of masters, who knew nothing, trying to meddle and leading their parties to annihilation. That’s why I’ve refrained from saying anything to Anytng until now.
 </p>
 <p>
  But after failing on floor 35, even my thoughts had started to change.
 </p>
 <p>
  I closed the internet window with a bitter smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Welcome to Pick Me Up!]
 </p>
 <p>
  At the same moment, Anytng logged in.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Loading completed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [T O U C H !(Select)]
 </p>
 <p>
  Right after connecting, Anytng went straight to the facilities tab.
 </p>
 <p>
  Exceptionally quick touch. His emotional state was palpable.

 <p>
  Anytng touched ‘Yes’ without hesitation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Got mad because they called you useless?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I smirked.

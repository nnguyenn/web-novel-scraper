 <p>
  I set up for the next game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Again, I decided to change the strategy.

 <p>
  [Game over!]
 </p>
 <p>
  And the result was in.
 </p>
 <p>
  I crossed my arms and looked to the right.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng was staring hard at the win/loss screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Three rounds of mock battles.
 </p>
 <p>
  This guy,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is unbelievably…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Terrible.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……Really.”
 </p>
 <p>
  First game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng didn’t move from the stronghold.
 </p>
 <p>
  I easily took the object and then used the buff to breach the defense of the stronghold.
 </p>
 <p>
  Second game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng sent all forces to the object.
 </p>
 <p>
  It didn’t take 30 seconds. I entered Anytng’s stronghold without shedding blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  Third game.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this game…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I did nothing.’

 <p>
  I just watched.
 </p>
 <p>
  I left the game to AI.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet Anytng lost.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This guy… what?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Astounding.
 </p>
 <p>
  Innate game sense.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s the first time I’ve seen a master worse than automated progression.
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t even use any complicated techniques. After all, it’s just a practice game. I chose strategies that one could easily counter after seeing them once.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Did you stuff doll eyes in your head?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Having watched the mission videos tens of times, one would expect to get a feel for it.

  I clicked my tongue and folded the map.
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s what I said!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle appeared spinning and snorted.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Racing games seem to be his forte. Dumb in other areas, I told you! Loki should take full responsibility for the missions.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “……Ha.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  An unexpected hurdle.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, Anytng was waiting on the main screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not performing any operations. Waiting for me to propose the next game.
 </p>
 <p>
  After about 5 minutes, Anytng moved the control window.

  Iselle stared blankly at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I shook my head.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han(★★★)’ has declined the mock battle!]
 </p>
 <p>
  After closing the rejection window, Anytng touched again.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master proposed a mock battle to ‘Han (★★★)’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…’
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han(★★★)’ has declined the mock battle!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng moved again after pondering.

 </p>
 <p>
  Pop.
 </p>
 <p>
  A Warhorse Statue appeared on the table.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking I would be swayed by such a shallow trick.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll play just one game.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I pocketed the statue and flicked my finger.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ba-dum!]
 </p>

  Iselle scratched her cheek.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle, who had been blaming the master up until the third game, began to feel sympathy as the game went past seven rounds, even cheering for a single win.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng was waiting at the control window.
 </p>
 <p>
  After ten straight defeats, he did not attempt a rematch.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, would you like to disconnect?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes(Selected)/ No]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Then, farewell!]
 </p>
 <p>
  After a while, Anytng disconnected.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle, resting her chin in her hands, said,
 </p>
 <p>
  [What’s the problem? Lack of talent?]
 </p>

 <p>
  “Who knows.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thirteen rounds.
 </p>
 <p>
  I reviewed Anytng’s play records.
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s at least a will to learn.
 </p>
 <p>
  Given the gold expenditure for retries.
 </p>
 <p>
  The minimum condition was met. It’s just that the results didn’t follow.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Strange.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if he’s talentless, watching the mission videos should’ve led to some realization.
 </p>
 <p>
  But when facing Anytng, it felt like I was up against a complete novice.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Iselle.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hmm?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Show me the mission videos the master uploaded again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle blinked but obediently complied.
 </p>
 <p>
  Videos from the 5th to the 30th floors quickly played in front of me.
 </p>
 <p>
  [So, Loki, do you see anything?]
 </p>
 <p>
  I closed the window.
 </p>
 <p>
  After watching up to the 30th floor, it was clear.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This kid…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Huh, huh.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Was only watching me.”
 </p>

 <p>
  Up to the 10th floor, the camera would rotate to check on other party members.
 </p>
 <p>
  But from the 15th floor onward, the focus was on me. It only briefly shifted when an important object appeared. The master’s focus, which should have been revisiting the entire flow of the mission, was directed solely at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was no wonder the timing for taking screenshots was lightning-fast.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having watched from the start, there was no way to miss it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Other members were left out in the cold.
 </p>
 <p>
  At best, he would occasionally glance at a member of the 1st party.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No wonder there’s no improvement.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng had developed bad habits.
 </p>
 <p>
  But my failure to recognize this beforehand was also at fault.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked up.

 <p>
  The dark sky. Somehow, I could sense what Anytng was feeling right now.
 </p>
 <p>
  Disheartened by the lack of results.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Wanted to be helpful.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps he felt something while watching the 35th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled and leaned back in the chair.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Iselle, can I ask you one more favor? I want to use the internet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The internet?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I want to send an email.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I took out a notebook and began to write down letters.
 </p>
 <p>
  Detailing the flow of battles from the 5th to the 30th floor. Compared to the strategy documents I sent, even a brain filled with noodles could easily understand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Right now, I’m not asking for much.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I can’t look after the party. When the entire raid is in crisis.
 </p>
 <p>
  I need you to have the ability to help once.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll just claim I’m a channel subscriber.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, even if there was no talent, I was planning to force it through him.
 </p>
 <p>
  If not ten times, then a hundred times.
 </p>
 <p>
  If that doesn’t work, a thousand times more.
 </p>
 <p>
  Until it’s hammered into his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I said I’d make you the best.’
 </p>
 <p>
  After all, it was work that needed to be done.
 </p>
 <p>
  I wrote down the letters in the notebook with a smile.

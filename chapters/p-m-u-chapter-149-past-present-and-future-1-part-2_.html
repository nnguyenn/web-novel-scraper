  A few more days passed.

 <p>
  Yurnet’s voice tickled my ears.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was late evening. I was organizing documents at my desk.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;I apologize if you were sleeping.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was doing some chores.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;It seems we haven’t been in touch much lately…&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve had quite a lot to do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I had been postponing matters related to Niflheim.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was the first communication with Yurnet since sending Eolka away.
 </p>
 <p>
  I put the documents in the drawer and locked it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s up? You wouldn’t call just to say hi.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;I wanted to bid you goodnight.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s a funny joke.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;…Didn’t you say you’d contact me every week?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Nothing. Just had something in my throat.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet coughed and then continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have something to report to the Master. It’s a significant issue, so I’ve determined it cannot be decided upon unilaterally.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A significant issue, huh.”
 </p>

 <p>
  I leaned back in my chair.
 </p>
 <p>
  Something that even Yurnet, the current sub-master, couldn’t decide on.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was only one thing that came to mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is it about the Union Guild?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Indeed, Master. You’ve hit the nail on the head.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Save the buttered-up compliments. If there’s something to tell, then tell it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;There are rumors that the Union Guild’s forces are gathering in one place.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “And the investigation results?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s true. Hundreds of airships are gathering from across the server.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I smirked.

 <p>
  There weren’t any world raids happening.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, they were gathering forces now, out of the blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Obvious enough.’
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Master, these bastards… I mean, a scheme by members of the Union Guild has been confirmed.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “I see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the comments on a video uploaded by Anytng, there was something that stood out.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was about recruiting reserve members for the Union Guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  It had been left unchecked amidst indifference.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;It’s a bit different.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Different how?”

 </p>
 <p>
  A window popped up in my view.
 </p>
 <p>
  A play button on a red rectangle. The icon of YouTube.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the background was slightly different. This is…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘My channel, isn’t it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was Loki’s channel.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boasting about five million subscribers.
 </p>
 <p>
  The last video update was six months ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  The screen changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the most recent video clip.

  Pretending to be a pro but this guy also heavily pays to win.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s all an act. Not skill, just luck. Just got lucky with hero draws and ended up like this.

  If you’re gonna pay to win, at least do it with flair like our bro.

  Suddenly, all these screw-loose losers are popping off. You guys have an inferiority complex? Why mess with Lord Loki like this.

  Almost identical, just the usernames changed. Believable organizational power even if they hired comment bots.
 </p>
 <p>
  I scrolled down and then closed the window.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Comments like these ones have been simultaneously spammed on the videos you posted, Master.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  I laughed.
 </p>
 <p>
  What a cute act.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;The exact timing was a week ago, Earth time, after the Bartz Alliance was crushed.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Bartz Alliance?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;It was formed to oppose the Union Guild’s rampant looting activities. Seems they couldn’t last even a week. But that’s not the important part.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet spoke in a stern tone.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;We need you, Master.&gt;
 </p>

 <p>
  “Really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Yes. If Master were in Niflheimr…&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you saying Niflheimr will lose to these guys?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet coughed awkwardly.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;If Master were present, our losses would be minimized, that’s what it means.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Handle it yourself. I didn’t set it up to be so weak.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;…When were you ever going to forget?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hm?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Nothing.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Do I really need to be in Niflheimr?
 </p>
 <p>
  Not really. Niflheimr’s operational system was already complete.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Except in emergencies.’
 </p>
 <p>
  But, there’s never been such a case, so who knows.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ve always been waging wars with missions.
 </p>
 <p>
  PVP was just a side thing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Handle it appropriately. Inform me once it’s over.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Master, even if I ask like this… won’t you consider?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why are you asking for that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;I can’t remember Master’s face.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  I sighed.

  “Tell me clearly. Why do I need to be there?”

 <p>
  &lt;I don’t have command over Niflheim’s first party.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you saying you want to gather the first party?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Yes.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…’
 </p>
 <p>
  I stroked my chin.
 </p>
 <p>
  The goal of the Union Guild was clear enough without having to see it.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to reports, they hadn’t touched any other rankers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just me.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I knew they’d come.’

 <p>
  Faster than I expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What could a low-level do in a high-level fight zone.’
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I responded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet continued with a brighter voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;I’ve sent a dispatch request to the Master of Townia. They’ll understand. The airship will arrive in two days. Please take care of yourself until then.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Call back everyone. Don’t let anyone get killed for no reason. And it would be good to have detailed power and combat data on them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;As you command.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Before ending the communication, Yurnet said,
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Thank you for granting my request, Master.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you talking about.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I had promised to help.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was just joking. There was no way I could refuse.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Maybe now is the best time.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A rest period to replenish forces.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was okay to be away for a while.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the ring on my left hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  A black sheen flowed along the surface of the ring.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet had said that this, a gift from her, was proof of being the owner of Niflheimr.
 </p>
 <p>
  I guess I should repay the favor received.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is it war then.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Niflheimr never runs from a fight.
 </p>
 <p>
  We have always fought head-on.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoever it is.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were numerous challenges,
 </p>
 <p>
  A very large guild with hundreds of members, and then it was a guild alliance from another server, even a ranker like me tried to conquer Niflheimr, but no one succeeded.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘129 wins out of 129.’
 </p>
 <p>
  This was the 130th time.
 </p>
 <p>
  I got up from my seat.

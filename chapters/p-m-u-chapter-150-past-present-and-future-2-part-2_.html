 <p>
  How many hours had I slept?
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>

 <p>
  I opened my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  With a loud noise, the hammock shook violently.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘……?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked out the window.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sky had darkened. It seemed like night had fallen.
 </p>
 <p>
  But… what’s this vibration?
 </p>
 <p>
  The entire ship was shaking at regular intervals.
 </p>
 <p>
  It didn’t seem to be an aftereffect of the dimensional leap. I dressed in armor and armed myself before heading outside. As I emerged onto the deck, the situation became clear.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lydel was gritting her teeth, waving her hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bright strands of magic power were bursting from her entire body. She was using magic.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s happening?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, that’s…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, I see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked to the side of the railing.
 </p>
 <p>
  A giant purple hull caught my eye. The metallic surface was decorated with dragons and swords, intertwining and wriggling with the logo of the Union Guild engraved on it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That was quick.’
 </p>

 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  The heat from the cannon hit Landgrid07’s protective barrier.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A blind attack.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Since Niflheimr’s mark was visible, it would be easy to distinguish.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like we were intercepted on our way from Townia to Niflheimr.
 </p>
 <p>
  Landgrid07 quickly advanced, widening the distance, but the pursuing flying ship followed.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;You guys are from Niflheimr, right? Rankers acting all high and mighty, you arrogant bastards!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  A man’s gruff voice echoed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lydel looked distressed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m sorry. I didn’t expect this!”
 </p>

 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What should we do? This isn’t a combat ship, and we don’t have weapons…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked around the deck.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed there were no crew members except for Lydel.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, a sorceress is a purely auxiliary class. She practically had no combat power.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Hahaha! From now on, those who bear the black goat mark won’t move in peace!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m sorry, I’m so sorry!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why are you apologizing so much?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But, to put you in danger…”
 </p>
 <p>
  While Lydel apologized, the flying ship’s cannons fired.
 </p>

 <p>
  A decisive blow. With the sound of breaking glass, Landgrid07 staggered, and the protective barrier shattered.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Hahahaha! I’ll kill you all!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll buy us some time!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lydel, with a determined expression, held her staff.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the same time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash.
 </p>
 <p>
  Several figures appeared on the deck.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was an infiltration by teleportation magic.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is bad.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Trouble from the very beginning.

 <p>
  A man with a grim face licked his blade.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, a man with a frivolous look drew his dagger.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Only two of them. Lucky.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehe, I’ll make you regret being born.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I assessed them one by one.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were eight in total. They didn’t seem very strong.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though they would likely be much higher level than me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can you use fortification magic?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes? That’s possible…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good.”

 <p>
  I reached for my sword sheath.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oy, Oy. Do we look this weak? You’re only level 34 and you want to fight us?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehe, you don’t know your place! I’m level 50! I’ll slice your limbs into pieces…”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There’s a magician over there.’
 </p>
 <p>
  They caught onto my status.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, it was kind of them to reveal their own level.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll decorate my room with your skull…”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Ascend.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han(★★★)’ enters Ascend state!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack!

 <p>
  The head of the man who was babbling vanished.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before the recoil of the skill hit, I shouted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Lydel, use fortification magic!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Strands of magic power wrapped around my entire body.
 </p>
 <p>
  The imbalance in my body settled down.
 </p>
 <p>
  I should be able to hold out for 30 seconds.
 </p>
 <p>
  Feeling explosive power, I swung my sword at the next target.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You little bastard!”
 </p>

 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  The blades collided.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, it only pushed him back without killing him.
 </p>
 <p>
  The man momentarily looked shocked, then his eyes filled with killing intent.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You, a mere lowbie… you are dangerous!”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He’s about level 70.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As expected, it was no good.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if I managed to deal with a level 50 due to a moment of carelessness, the basic spec difference was too vast.
 </p>
 <p>
  I bitterly smiled and deactivated Ascend.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lydel panicked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What should we do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m not sure.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Maybe I should buy us some time…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I shook my head.
 </p>
 <p>
  The enemies started to approach.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll send both of your heads to Niflheimr!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Whatever.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll kill you first!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The man stomped his foot.
 </p>
 <p>
  His figure blurred, and the distance of a few meters closed instantly.
 </p>

 <p>
  Indeed, he was high-level.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘To die…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, lightning struck out of the blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  The lightning struck the man charging at me, and at the spot, a golden flash erupted.
 </p>
 <p>
  The enemies’ expressions froze in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rumble!
 </p>
 <p>
  A second lightning bolt struck.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lightning took on the shape of a person.
 </p>
 <p>
  A black uniform covering the entire body. Long, platinum hair from which electricity sparked.
 </p>
 <p>
  A youthful face with a mischievous smile was directed at the enemy.

 </p>
 <p>
  The girl smiled broadly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ever been hit at the speed of light?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ultra-fast Ziri Punch!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack!
 </p>
 <p>
  Lightning flashed, and seven bodies disappeared.

 <p>
  “Nahaha.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The girl who had just defeated seven opponents with ease wiped her nose.

  “Sorry for being late. Got lost on the way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She scratched her head and laughed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yurnet said it was to the right, but it turned out to be to the left. Ended up going round and round the same place for an hour…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  The airship’s cannon fired.
 </p>
 <p>
  The girl’s fist blurred, then with a flash of lightning, the cannonball vanished on the spot.
 </p>
 <p>
  I squinted my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You are…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just wait a sec. Let me handle this annoyance first.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The girl extended her right hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come forth, Bryunak!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle!
 </p>
 <p>
  Golden lightning began to gather in her right hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  The lightning formed the shape of a winged bow. It was Bryunak, one of the five legendary weapons exclusive to the first party. As Nihaku mimed drawing the bow, a golden arrow materialized.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Bang!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle!
 </p>
 <p>
  A golden flash enveloped everything in sight.
 </p>
 <p>
  The lightning bolt shot from Bryunak pierced through the airship’s protective barrier as easily as tofu and penetrated the deck. And then…

 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  The massive airship exploded instantaneously.
 </p>
 <p>
  It breached dozens of magical barriers and steel plates in a single strike, a demise so trivial it was almost pathetic for its size.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s see, about twenty-five. Three of them were magicians. A fair division of labor.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master, you look a bit odd. Is it my way of speaking that bothers you? Sorry, it didn’t work out the way I wanted.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The girl scratched her head, looking somewhat embarrassed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet’s voice tickled my ears.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Please be understanding. She can’t help it.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The heroes who first encountered her had all reacted in unusual ways.

 <p>
  Well, I was already aware of her unique personality.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s fine. I was expecting this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The girl before me was the most lively and active among the five heroes of the first party, and the youngest. She was Nihaku Guestfel, ranked fifth in Niflheim’s hierarchy.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That is… you are…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lydel stuttered, staring at Nihaku.
 </p>
 <p>
  “From the 13th floor…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nihaku.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s an honor to meet a hero of your renown!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s no need for such honorifics.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lydel vigorously shook Nihaku’s hand.

  “Just as the rumors said, you’re strong! To think you could destroy an airship with a single strike!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re overreacting. It’s nothing special.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Nihaku brushed off Lydel’s hand and looked at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, she bowed politely.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I am Nihaku Guestfel. It’s an honor to meet you, Master. I heard you visited before, but you were already gone… I was quite saddened. I thought maybe you didn’t like me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s nothing to like or dislike. It’s good to see you here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master, you’re as cool and dashing as I imagined!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Let’s skip the compliments.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked to the side.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle, crackle.

 <p>
  Electric currents swirled around the remnants of the destroyed airship.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was an astonishing display of power. This airship was far more advanced than any I had faced in Harla. It was protected by a high-intensity magical barrier, but Nihaku destroyed it with a single strike.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Seeing it from a hero’s perspective really brings it home.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As a Master, I had only ever looked down upon these events.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, Nihaku hadn’t shown her full strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  That had been merely a playful gesture.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anyway.
 </p>
 <p>
  The problem was solved.
 </p>
 <p>
  I returned inside the ship.
 </p>
 <p>
  We were close to our destination.

 <p>
  I had planned to get some sleep.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why are you following me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can’t I?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Nihaku clung to my side.
 </p>
 <p>
  I shook my head and entered my room. Nihaku tried to follow me into the hammock like a pet snuggling up to its owner. I pushed her away.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nihaku Guestfel.
 </p>
 <p>
  When she was first summoned, she did nothing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just lay in her room as if dead, barely breathing. A total dud.
 </p>
 <p>
  I nearly replaced her several times but refrained. If I hadn’t accidentally discovered her talent for combat, she would have been fused away. After that, it was a test of endurance. She was so stubborn.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking back, it became clear.

  These beings were indeed alive within the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had harbored deep-seated prejudices.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What good does it do now?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Later, Lydel’s guidance woke me up.
 </p>
 <p>
  We had arrived at our destination. After dressing, I looked down to see Nihaku sleeping soundly below. I left her there and went out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon reaching the deck, I was met with an unexpected scene.
 </p>
 <p>
  Landgrid07 was sliding over the airfield towards the hangar, but there were no guides in sight. This wasn’t a portal to Niflheimr. Seconds later, I realized where we were.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Brunhild?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes! Our destination is not Niflheimr.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lydel saluted me.

 <p>
  Brunhild01. The flagship of Niflheimr’s fleet.
 </p>
 <p>
  We were inside the hangar of Brunhild01.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll leave you here, Master. It was an honor to serve you!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Clank. Creak.
 </p>
 <p>
  The airship’s stairs began to unfold.
 </p>
 <p>
  After thanking Lydel for her service, I descended the stairs.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Welcome back, Master. Have you been well?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet greeted me with a smile below, dressed not in her usual voluminous white robe but in a black uniform decorated with white embroidery.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m so sleepy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please, come this way. We’ve prepared a place for you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  An elevator descended from above.
 </p>
 <p>
  I boarded it, and it began to ascend.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you receive the report?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve got a rough estimate. The Bartz Alliance, was it? It’d be helpful to have footage of the attack.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course, it’s prepared.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The elevator continued its steep ascent.
 </p>
 <p>
  The scenery changed. The interior of Brunhild unfolded before us.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where are we? This doesn’t seem anywhere near Niflheimr.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re not far from the assembly point of the Union Guild.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A forward base, then.”

 <p>
  Yurnet had adapted to the situation appropriately.
 </p>
 <p>
  This location was actually more convenient for rapid action.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But Master. I have a request if you’d permit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s to preserve the master’s dignity.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet smiled softly, sending a chill down my spine.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You won’t refuse, will you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Depends on the need.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s absolutely necessary.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The elevator stopped.

 <p>
  The top floor corridor of Brunhild appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet opened a door on the side of the corridor and led me in.
 </p>
 <p>
  I followed, though with a puzzled expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  A circular room lined with mirrors.
 </p>
 <p>
  A mannequin, modeled after my physique, wore a stunning uniform.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You can’t mean…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve designed this with great care, the uniform of Niflheimr’s commander.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You expect me to wear this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The uniform’s chest was adorned with elaborate golden embroidery.
 </p>
 <p>
  The epaulets, the shiny metallic belt, the black leather boots, and the cap…
 </p>
 <p>
  It was beyond comprehension.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There are other crew members in the command bridge. A fitting presence for the Master…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No way, I refuse!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What… Why? I made this outfit specifically for you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet’s shoulders drooped.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s absurd! Leather armor is enough for me!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If the commander appears in shabby attire, it might affect the morale.”
 </p>
 <p>
  This was madness.
 </p>
 <p>
  I shook my head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I thought you said you’d agree to anything…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I never said that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s disappointing. To think you don’t appreciate my efforts for you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet wiped her eyes with her sleeve.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really… Can’t you reconsider?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet looked at me with a pleading expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This manipulative…’
 </p>
 <p>
  30 minutes later.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Bravo…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Quiet!”
 </p>

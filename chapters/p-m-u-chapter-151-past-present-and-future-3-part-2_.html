 <p>
  Yurnet looked at me with a pleading expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This manipulative…’

 <p>
  30 minutes later.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Bravo…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Quiet!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I was walking down the corridor.
 </p>
 <p>
  With every step, the stiff sensation brushed against my entire body.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You look magnificent. It’s truly breathtaking.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Didn’t I tell you to be quiet?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is quite the imposition.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I felt mortifyingly embarrassed.
 </p>
 <p>
  I pressed down the cap’s brim.
 </p>
 <p>
  Silently, I walked down the corridor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet followed, continuously expressing her bizarre admiration.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Annoying.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Given her personality, she’s bound to keep a photo of this.
 </p>
 <p>
  Today, a dark history has been made.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, Yurnet’s point had some merit.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was the one who had provided the heroes with their uniforms to foster a sense of belonging.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet was wearing one of those uniforms. I never imagined I would end up wearing one myself.

 <p>
  After about five minutes of walking, the command bridge of Brunhild was revealed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The size of a small sports field. The leader’s seat was at the center, with the control station and crew seats arranged in a circle. Several heroes who were busy with their duties turned to look at me and bowed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The identity of the Master won’t spread. Only those with tight lips were selected.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I hope so.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked away.
 </p>
 <p>
  The glass showing the blue sky was visible.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please, take a seat.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet pointed to the leader’s seat.
 </p>
 <p>
  I clicked my tongue and sat down.
 </p>
 <p>
  In front of me was a circular table with a hologram map floating above it.

 <p>
  “First.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Have we located all the members of the first party?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I needed Yurnet because I didn’t have command authority over the first party.
 </p>
 <p>
  Without the five from the 13th floor, there could be losses. Yurnet nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “As you can see, Nihaku has already joined us. Ridgion will come rushing if you give the word. We’ve received a reply from Myuden. However…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s Seris we’re missing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems she’s quite far away. What would you like to do? We can call her if necessary.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Leave her be.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seris wasn’t necessary.

 <p>
  That was the conclusion I reached after analyzing the Union Guild’s forces.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood. I’ll immediately issue command authority in your name to the other members.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll be stepping out for a moment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet bowed respectfully.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The combat data you requested will be brought by a new intern.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Intern?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They’ll be here shortly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet left with a meaningful smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  I examined the table. It was covered in documents with various information, including Niflheimr’s mobilizable forces and various details about the Union Guild.

 <p>
  I used to receive this information digitally when I was a Master.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looks like I won’t be sleeping tonight. I started flipping through the documents at the front.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, suddenly.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Urgh!]
 </p>
 <p>
  A small fairy, struggling with a document bag, flew towards me.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Why does that fox always make me do this! Go make coffee or something! Always nagging! I’m so annoyed! Just you wait, when Loki recognizes my value, I’ll show you…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Our eyes met.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You, you’re!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “How have you been, Pirate King?”
 </p>

 <p>
  [I didn’t hear you were coming. When did you arrive?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle placed the document bag on the table.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked her over. She wasn’t wearing her Pirate King outfit, but she had on a black uniform and a cap. The eyepatch covering her left eye remained.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Adjusting well? You were dreaming about coming to Niflheimr.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Well…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not as easy as you thought?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hmph! Did you think it would be? To abandon my grand dream of soaring through the skies, to be suddenly kidnapped and turned into a slave. It’s miserable. So miserable. The name of the Pirate King cries out…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then I’ll release you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Aaah!]
 </p>

 <p>
  Iselle spread her hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Being Niflheimr’s intern is the best!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle spun around, and in her right hand appeared a ‘MIXIM’ brand instant coffee packet, and in her left hand, a paper cup filled with hot water.
 </p>
 <p>
  She quickly made the coffee and placed the paper cup on the table.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Coffee, scanning, copying! I’m perfect. Dreams change. From now on, I’ll be the King of Interns. Remember that!]
 </p>
 <p>
  After doing this and that, Iselle zoomed away.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I opened the document bag.
 </p>
 <p>
  It contained records of the attack on the Bartz Alliance.
 </p>
 <p>
  As I touched the edge of the paper, it crumbled into light.

 <p>
  [The record has been entered.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The table’s hologram displayed the text.
 </p>
 <p>
  So it’s digital after all.
 </p>
 <p>
  I drank the coffee.
 </p>
 <p>
  It tasted just like the coffee I used to have on Earth.

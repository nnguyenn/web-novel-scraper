 <p>
  It was only late in the evening that I could finally go through all the documents.
 </p>
 <p>
  The content was truly extensive. The report included not only basic specs like troop numbers or airship counts but also detailed personal records of every member of the Union Guild, their spending history, and wide-ranging information up to notable heroes’ characteristics and biographies.

 <p>
  ‘I have to read all this?’
 </p>
 <p>
  While I admired Yurnet’s ability to not miss even the smallest details, the tiredness was overwhelming.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Well.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was me who had requested this form of reporting.
 </p>
 <p>
  Back then, it felt like playing a game, but now…
 </p>
 <p>
  I shook my head and took a sip from the cup.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was empty. I reached out my hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Whiz!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle made a sound effect with her mouth and instantly prepared a mixed coffee.
 </p>
 <p>
  I gulped down the hot coffee.
 </p>
 <p>
  [How do you think it will go?]
 </p>
 <p>
  While I was drinking the coffee, Iselle peeked out.
 </p>
 <p>
  She had been in and out several times to carry the document bag, so she must be curious.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I know because I’ve been in Harla, but the Union Guild is really strong. Especially their leader, he’s incredible. He hasn’t lost even once up to the 70th floor. I only saw that guy’s hero once…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle shivered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You saw him?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It was a demonstration duel. Dozens of kids fell without being able to touch even a hair. What’s scarier is that this guy is only considered slightly stronger than the other members of his main party!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course.

 <p>
  The spending history of that leader was astronomical.
 </p>
 <p>
  He poured in billions of won in less than three months.
 </p>
 <p>
  He owns nearly thirty-five-star heroes by birth.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The power of money.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It can’t be ignored.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though I’m known as a model non-spender, my own spending amount was significant.
 </p>
 <p>
  Over 40 million won over two years, not just for hero summoning but also for building facilities and enjoying other conveniences. I hardly do it anymore, though.
 </p>
 <p>
  I went over the Union’s gathered forces.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were 578 airships.
 </p>
 <p>
  The number of heroes was close to 5,000.
 </p>

 <p>
  Considering most of them are combatants, it was a staggering number. Niflheimr’s total membership is 20,000, but the actual number of members who engage in combat isn’t much.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There must be more in reality.’
 </p>
 <p>
  They said they owned nearly 1,000 airships.
 </p>
 <p>
  Almost double the number of Niflheimr. The heroes would be the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Even for Loki, who wins every battle, this won’t be easy!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle raised her snout proudly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why are you proud? You’re part of Niflheimr now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Uh, cough! It’s just a warning. Since the Union is not to be underestimated, I meant to say give it your all.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle approached me with sparkling eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  [So, Loki, what’s the plan? Do you have a secret weapon to turn this disadvantage around? Some ingenious strategy that deceives the heavens and covers the earth…]

  “There’s nothing like that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I sipped my coffee.
 </p>
 <p>
  […Eh?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s no such strategy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [What, what do you mean? How will we turn this around? If we face them head-on, we’ll lose? Niflheimr’s forces are…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You know it right. 20,000 heroes. 427 airships.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle looked stunned.
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled faintly and looked at the hologram.
 </p>
 <p>
  There, a declaration of war sent by the Union Guild to Niflheimr was posted.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s fight fair and square in one place. Until one side is annihilated. The winner takes all. And… we’ll broadcast our victory?’
 </p>

 <p>
  The Union Guild seemed to want a massive fleet battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  One thing to note was their intention to broadcast the battle on Oneinch TV.
 </p>
 <p>
  From the beginning to the end of the battle. They intended to show the world Niflheimr’s downfall.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A broadcast?’
 </p>
 <p>
  None of my opponents had ever done such a thing.
 </p>
 <p>
  The declaration ended with an offer to acknowledge the regime if I admitted defeat and joined the Union Guild. After reading the words once more, I turned off the hologram.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The battle is scheduled for tomorrow.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Not real-time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Tomorrow in-game time.
 </p>
 <p>
  This news would have spread to all Pick Me Up! sites, including the official cafe by now.

 <p>
  If I don’t show up, they’ll mock and laugh at me, turning me into a joke.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A shallow trick.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The deadline is extremely short.
 </p>
 <p>
  A trick to reduce the preparation time for the battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Uh, this is dangerous…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle, who was looking at the declaration with me, held her head, sweating profusely and swaying her body as if defeat was already certain.
 </p>
 <p>
  [It would be better if you surrender to the Union, and later… Ack!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle spun like a windmill and flew away.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then Yurnet entered the bridge and bowed to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please forgive me. It seems my inexperience led me to a careless mistake.”

 <p>
  “Master, have you decided on a response?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where are the other two?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ridgion has just arrived through the dimensional gate. Myuden will take a bit more time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That makes sense. He’s far away.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I emptied the cup in one gulp and said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Tomorrow, I’ll go out at the time they’ve set.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What about the deploying of troops?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I opened my mouth with a smile.

 <p>
  The next evening,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I, Ridgion, at your service, Master.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A young man in uniform kneeled before me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I still can’t get used to this. With a bitter smile, I helped Ridgion to his feet.
 </p>
 <p>
  With this, all three members of the first party had gathered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master, here are the current forces of the Union Guild.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet waved her hand, and hundreds of red dots appeared in front of us.
 </p>
 <p>
  One dot represented an airship. There were now 600 ships, more than yesterday.
 </p>
 <p>
  “8 PM, huh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the table.
 </p>
 <p>
  The current time was 7:42 PM. There were less than 20 minutes until the confrontation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘To go through all this trouble.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked to the right.
 </p>
 <p>
  [http://go.onewinch .tv/ – Oneinch TV]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Pick Me Up! – Union Guild VS Niflheimr]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Viewers: 213,053]
 </p>
 <p>
  The broadcast was already a hit.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not just on Oneinch TV, but famous BJs were also broadcasting the scene on their channels.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the broadcast screen, hundreds of airships were floating.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I didn’t expect it to become a spectacle.’

  It’s unbelievable.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry. Master’s face will not be revealed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Otherwise we’ll be in trouble.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I crossed my arms and looked ahead from the captain’s seat.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dimension 7375 – McKernus]
 </p>
 <p>
  The meet-up place was an ownerless dimension.
 </p>
 <p>
  Beyond the sky dyed with deep sunset, hundreds of airships were lined up in formation, visible even with the naked eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle shivered.
 </p>
 <p>
  [So, so many of them.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “They feel buzzing with life. Doesn’t it look like it’ll be fun to shoot?”

  Nihaku, squatting down, laughing.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Fun to shoot? We’d be rags just from their volley! Why do we only have one ship? Niflheimr also has a magnificent fleet…]
 </p>
 <p>
  A sword silently extended to Iselle’s neck.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master’s command. Stop whining.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […]
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridgion sheathed his sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle looked at him with a pale face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems to be starting.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet, standing next to me, said.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking at the map, hundreds of red dots were approaching.

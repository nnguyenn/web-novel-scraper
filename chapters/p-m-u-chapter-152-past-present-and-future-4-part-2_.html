 <p>
  “It seems to be starting.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet, standing next to me, said.

 <p>
  Looking at the map, hundreds of red dots were approaching.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Niflheeeimr!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  A voice loud enough to tear the eardrums shook the bridge.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;I am the fleet commander, Nistarda! Why did you only send one airship? Did you take our declaration of war lightly?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  [Jackal777 : What? Why there’s only one ship from Niflheimr?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [avaescort : Did they really come to surrender?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [gkk0113 : ???? Really???]
 </p>
 <p>
  [craywolf3153 : Waited all day for this!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Goldspoon : Lol, even Loki has given up! Money solves everything.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The chat on the right side of my vision was updating rapidly.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the midst of it, I noticed a familiar ID.
 </p>
 <p>
  [WindFlow : Go Loki!!!!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Iselle0479 : You must win at all costs~~~~!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Weird people are watching.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, it doesn’t matter.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yurnet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Tell them to turn off the broadcast.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet nodded and sent a proposal.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, the response was rejection and mockery.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They refused.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then there’s nothing we can do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Solidarity mobilized 600 airships and close to 4,000 heroes.
 </p>
 <p>
  In contrast, I only dispatched Brünhilde01. In terms of fleet battle, we were no match. No matter how good Brünhilde’s performance was, it couldn’t overcome the disparity of hundreds to one.
 </p>
 <p>
  On Oneinch TV, chats expressing disappointment in me were running in a series.
 </p>
 <p>
  When the broadcast manager of the Union Guild conveyed that Loki asked to turn off the broadcast, the reactions became even more heated.
 </p>
 <p>
  I harbored a smirk.

 <p>
  They get excited quickly and cool down just as fast.
 </p>
 <p>
  The opposite was true as well. Today would be the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Want to surrender? Sorry, but it’s too late! Today, we will annihilate you and show everyone that the Union Guild rules this world!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Talkative, aren’t they.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridgion laughed coldly.
 </p>
 <p>
  I leaned back in my chair.
 </p>
 <p>
  To my left was Yurnet, to my right Ridgion, and behind me, Nihaku.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just three people.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The distance to the fleet was closing.

 <p>
  The current time was 8 PM. The time posted in the declaration of war.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hundreds of airships had surrounded Brünhilde01.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Here they come.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Light began to gather at the gun ports of the airships to the left.
 </p>
 <p>
  Like the Milky Way, a white light lit up. It was a volley from the entire fleet.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yurnet, I have a question.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I sat in my chair and spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why did you call me? I’m useless.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s because… we wanted to show you how we fight.”

  “Is that so.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Hundreds of beams of light covered my vision.
 </p>
 <p>
  And when I opened my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I found myself in an unfamiliar place.
 </p>
 <p>
  A circular area, reminiscent of a sports field.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dozens of control devices and people filled every seat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ve arrived.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet spoke.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Achilles, was it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. The flagship of the Union Guild.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet had teleported us inside the enemy’s flagship, bypassing kilometers of distance.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No response from the enemy! Sunk!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uhahaha! How arrogant. Just one ship? We’ll advance as is. Attack Niflheimr!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A man who appeared to be the captain laughed heartily.
 </p>
 <p>
  While he was chatting with the crew, his gaze suddenly turned towards us.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We are invincible… Huh? You, what are you doing here! How did you get in?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was wondering if someone was here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The door opened, and a man with sharp eyes walked in.
 </p>

 <p>
  He had three swords at his waist.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I knew it wouldn’t end like this. You’ve come, Loki’s hounds.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The blond man sneered coldly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shadows of dozens of heroes rose behind him on the bridge.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Are they the top heroes of the Union Guild?’
 </p>
 <p>
  A blade-like aura emanated from the man.
 </p>
 <p>
  The others were the same. It was clear. Each was a powerhouse that had reached the pinnacle of the 6-star realm.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uhahaha, I don’t know how you got here, but you’ve come to find your way to the afterlife! Take them down!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, captain.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh?”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Quiet”
 </p>
 <p>
  “W-what?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “These guys are my prey alone. Don’t interfere.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The blond man continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I am Schutra, the White Sword King. And you are…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Schutra’s gaze shifted to Ridigion.
 </p>
 <p>
  A confident smile hung on his lips.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve heard much about you, Sword Demon. I shall take that false title from you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sword Demon?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry about it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridigion smiled broadly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, anyway.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The White Sword King.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ve read about him in reports.
 </p>
 <p>
  A master of swordsmanship who has never lost in a hundred duels.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s said that the heroes gave him the name ‘White Sword King’ out of horror.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Die! The title of Mobius’s supreme swordsman is mine!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Schutra’s hand moved towards his scabbard, and with dazzling speed, his sword was drawn.
 </p>
 <p>
  His swordsmanship was so fast that it was almost imperceptible. Without extraordinary perception, it would have been impossible to catch.
 </p>
 <p>
  “White Sword King.”
 </p>

  “…Hmm?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “May I borrow your sword?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridigion appeared in front of Schutra and snatched the sword from his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, a streak of sword light flashed across the bridge.
 </p>
 <p>
  Following that, 25 crew members.
 </p>
 <p>
  19 of the guard forces, many of whom were 6-star heroes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Including other personnel, a total of 47 heroes were instantly reduced to chunks of meat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Schutra dumbfoundedly stared at the cleared bridge.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridigion returned the sword to Schutra’s scabbard.

  “It served me well. A fine sword indeed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, it was.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Blood splattered. In front of the Master.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “My apologies.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In front stood the captain, with a baffled expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That’s why I told you to turn off the broadcast.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If the pay-to-win players get slaughtered live, wouldn’t the game’s sales plummet?
 </p>
 <p>
  I walked past the captain with a smile.

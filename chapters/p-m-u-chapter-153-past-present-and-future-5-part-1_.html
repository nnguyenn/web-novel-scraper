  “Please, take a seat.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet guided me to the captain’s chair.

 <p>
  I sat down, leaning back in the chair. Beyond the bridge, the view outside was revealed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He must be watching.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In Pick Me Up!, multi-perspective viewing is supported.
 </p>
 <p>
  The masters of the Union Guild would have seen what happened inside the bridge.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, because it’s in the game, so there would be differences from what I experienced, but they could grasp the situation to some extent.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Leroy (Jenkins): ??????]
 </p>
 <p>
  [SuperSuper: What just happened?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [HanZoTokTokTok (Trolpick): Suddenly awkward?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Sigin (Sigin333): Can’t you see? Loki Hero sliced through our forces with a single strike.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Magnum (Raass13): Were there not a lot of max-level heroes?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The broadcast was the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dozens of chat lines refreshed simultaneously.
 </p>
 <p>
  I clicked my tongue. It wasn’t exactly a spectacle I wanted others to see.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master, your command.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you talking about?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please command us to victory.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I narrowed my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet was bowing her head beside me.
 </p>

 <p>
  Ridgion and Nihaku were doing the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We cannot move without the Master’s command.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Such troublesome matters.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The three surrounded me, not moving an inch.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was not something I was used to.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sighed and muttered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Win.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “As the Master wishes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  All three knelt simultaneously.
 </p>
 <p>
  I, being their Master, knew best.

 <p>
  Now that I had become a hero, I felt it even more.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘These guys…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Are strong.
 </p>
 <p>
  Incredibly so.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unimaginably so.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s begin.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet stood up.
 </p>
 <p>
  A white light flashed in her eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Continue.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Ch-ching.

 <p>
  Surrounding Yurnet’s entire body, countless bookshelves unfurled.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, Yurnet dipped her fingers into the control hologram floating in the cockpit.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Unknown Error!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Unknown Error!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Unknown Error…….]
 </p>
 <p>
  Hundreds of warning messages popped up in the hologram along with the alarm.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the messages disappeared in a few seconds.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Configuration change complete!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Reassigning the master of the fleet control system.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Current Master – Loki]

 <p>
  In less than 10 seconds, Yurnet, having seized command over hundreds of airships, proceeded with the next action.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Issuing a simultaneous bombardment order to the entire fleet!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Warning – The target is friendly!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, the warning was lightly ignored.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You have an impressive weapon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet smiled softly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Along with that, the Union Guild’s flagship, Acherus, began to slowly rotate.
 </p>
 <p>
  The main cannon’s targeting system aimed at a cluster of airships.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Fire.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet pressed the button hard.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  Kwaah!
 </p>
 <p>
  The entire bridge shook, and a massive pillar of light pierced through the cluster of airships.
 </p>
 <p>
  A few seconds later, a frantic voice echoed through the bridge.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Commander, what are you doing?! Have you lost your mind!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “It, it wasn’t me!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The captain’s face turned pale, and he slumped down.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s about time they react.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked to the right side of my field of vision.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like the masters on the Union Guild’s side had given their orders as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Fire, fire, fire.”
 </p>

 <p>
  Bang! Bang! Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  Every time Yurnet pressed the button, explosions followed explosions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hundreds of airships aimed their cannons this way.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;You bastards!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Light began to emerge from the cannon muzzles.
 </p>
 <p>
  A sign of a volley of fire.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, just before firing, the cannons’ directions inexplicably shifted.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kwaah!
 </p>
 <p>
  Cannons fired at each other instead.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dozens of airships were shattered into debris.
 </p>

 <p>
  “This is fun.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet covered her mouth and chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the control hologram.
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the airships, countless red dots appeared. They had teleported the Union Guild’s elite heroes to suppress us. They were quickly advancing toward the bridge.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridgion extended his hand, and a dazzling silver blade was drawn.
 </p>
 <p>
  With his stance ready, Ridgion moved his hand. A white flash sprinted through the bridge.
 </p>
 <p>
  The red dots on the internal map rapidly disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Long-range slaughter. The sword strike was delivered over tens of meters.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was an attack that ignored walls, shields, distance, everything.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  Goodness.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’m at a loss for words.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nihaku Guestfel, taking off!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Nihaku turned into a streak of lightning and burst through the ceiling.
 </p>
 <p>
  She was holding a golden bow.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;The Eye that Sees Everything.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet’s eyes glowed white.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Master, I will share this with you.&gt;
 </p>

 <p>
  Yurnet placed her finger on my forehead.
 </p>
 <p>
  Simultaneously, my field of vision widened.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the scene when weapons were summoned.
 </p>
 <p>
  The field of view was 360 degrees, with an observation distance of several kilometers.
 </p>
 <p>
  It allowed for piercing vision, even discerning the weaknesses and strengths of the opponents.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘……’
 </p>
 <p>
  Outside the bridge, in the corridors.
 </p>
 <p>
  Countless dead bodies were scattered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Heroes who had descended to the deck were instantly bisected by Ridgion’s sniping swordsmanship and disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Airships continued to fire cannons at each other.
 </p>

 <p>
  The crew tried desperately to stop it, but the main cannon kept loading and firing.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was useless to try to stop. This fleet was under Yurnet’s complete control.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hyper Zziri Zziri Lightning!”
 </p>
 <p>
  From Bruknak, lightning with a diameter of several meters burst forth.
 </p>
 <p>
  The lightning, stopped in mid-air, split into dozens of strands, accurately piercing the weak points of nearby airships.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sky flashed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The thunderstorm swept through the airships around it, continuously striking.
 </p>
 <p>
  [What, what is this…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle’s eyes widened, frozen in place.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s why strategy is unnecessary.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled bitterly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Like in the missions, if the forces were perfectly balanced or lacking, I might have had to use my head. But no matter how many times I reviewed the report and replayed the footage, there was no angle.
 </p>
 <p>
  [It doesn’t make sense! Just the three of them against thousands?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle winced.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The opponents have dozens of natural 5-stars, and there are so many 6-stars max levels!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Leveling up isn’t everything.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Stats are just the basics.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how many natural 5-stars there are, if the master neglects them, they become nothing special.
 </p>
 <p>
  They can’t overcome their limits.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It seems they were too arrogant.’
 </p>
 <p>
  These guys didn’t understand their place.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the broadcast screen. Rather than a cauldron of enthusiasm, the chat room had a chilly atmosphere.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They wouldn’t have known.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The last time I posted a video was six months ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  That too was an old video. They might have heard that I won a fight, but they wouldn’t know how.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Lodestone (Fiei053): The gap is… too vast…?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The broadcast has ended!]
 </p>
 <p>
  With that last comment, the broadcast on One-Inch TV turned off.
 </p>
 <p>
  I continued to observe the battlefield.
 </p>
 <p>
  The cannons were more harmful than not using them at all, and due to Yurnet’s hacking, communication between ships was impossible. The invading forces were being destroyed as soon as they arrived by Ridgion, and the fleet was being roasted by Nihaku’s shooting.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh ho, that is…”
 </p>
 <p>
  A purple comet trailed as it fell towards us.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Armageddon?”
 </p>
 <p>
  A high-level magic spell was activated by twenty wizards at the cost of their life force.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ve seen it a few times before.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems so.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet slowly waved her hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  The comet, hitting an invisible barrier, naturally dissipated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, lightning from Bruknak sprinted through the sky. Numerous blessings and magical barriers tried to block its path, but they were pierced through one by one. An airship exploded and broke apart.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, 587 unidentified channel chats have been detected.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Would you like to check?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes / No (selected)]
 </p>
 <p>
  I ignored it.
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s nothing to discuss with those about to die.

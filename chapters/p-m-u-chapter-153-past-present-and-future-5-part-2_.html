  [Yes / No (selected)]
 </p>
 <p>
  I ignored it.
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s nothing to discuss with those about to die.
 </p>
 <p>
  I spoke up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How’s the situation with their other forces?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Myuden is suppressing them along with the 1st fleet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I crossed my arms.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Union Guild’s total power was about 1,000 airships.
 </p>
 <p>
  They deployed about 600 of them here, while the rest went to attack Niflheimr’s main base. There was no need to investigate. It was expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A decoy from the start.’
 </p>
 <p>
  What we brought to the battlefield was merely a small airship.
 </p>
 <p>
  We couldn’t sacrifice the latest airships for this battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Union Guild’ member ‘Rodika’ has declared surrender!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do you accept?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes / No (selected)]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Union Guild’ member ‘Kilyud’ has…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Union Guild’ member…]

 <p>
  I rejected all the surrender declarations in succession.
 </p>
 <p>
  I leaned deeply into the back of my chair. The clear sky was now colored red with the glow and flash from the burning airships.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You bastards…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash.
 </p>
 <p>
  A light appeared in a corner of the bridge, and several heroes appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was clear at a glance. They were the Union Guild’s key figures, each with a twisted expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We will erase you from this world, even if it costs us our lives!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A knight in white armor, wielding a shining sword, charged at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before he could take a few steps, he was split into dozens of pieces and scattered.
 </p>
 <p>
  The woman behind him gritted her teeth.

  “At least the innocent crew members…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ridgion.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Snikt.
 </p>
 <p>
  As if they never existed, they disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  I cooled my gaze.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not a single one of them should be spared.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “As you command.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The airships attempting to leave the area returned to their places as if nothing had happened.
 </p>
 <p>
  Their piloting functions had been taken away.

 <p>
  ‘I can’t forgive backstabbers.’
 </p>
 <p>
  They said they would settle everything in one place but went to attack the main base on the other side.
 </p>
 <p>
  They had sold their consciences.
 </p>
 <p>
  [What are you…?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle looked around at Yurnet.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was fear in her gaze.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet smiled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you want to stop of being an intern, get used to it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [To what?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Winning.”
 </p>

 <p>
  Anyway.
 </p>
 <p>
  I moved my hand to the control window on the left side of my sight.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was Yurnet’s doing. The master’s screen was displayed.
 </p>
 <p>
  I entered the hero tab and adjusted the fleet.
 </p>
 <p>
  The target was the bases of Union Guild members we had identified in advance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not a single blade of grass would be left. The plan was to uproot them completely.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Millions will fly away in minutes.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, it’s not my money.
 </p>
 <p>
  I ordered the advance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering everything, there were hundreds of airships and thousands of men.
 </p>

 <p>
  They had used so much, yet survivors remained.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, they had lost all their combat capabilities.
 </p>
 <p>
  They wouldn’t be able to resist.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s about time they showed up.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I rested my chin in my hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were those who hadn’t appeared until now.
 </p>
 <p>
  A particularly notable group among the Union Guild’s heroes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master, it’s them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet whispered in my ear.
 </p>
 <p>
  I nodded. They are quite late.
 </p>

 <p>
  They should have incurred enough losses by now.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the left corner of the bridge, dark shadows gathered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shadows that appeared with an ominous aura rose up, each taking the form of a person.
 </p>
 <p>
  Three individuals, two men, and one woman, their profiles popped up in my sight.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Uruka Dije Lv.99]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Siha Niatra Lv.99]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Nord Lv.?]
 </p>
 <p>
  A robust old man, a woman with a bursting figure, and a young man with a pallid expression like a corpse.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each had a distinctive appearance.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-12" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  The commander of the airship opened his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Those are…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who are they?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They are direct heroes under the Union Guild’s leader! Be careful. They are on a different level from the heroes we’ve faced so far!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why are you speaking as if you’re on our side? You’re an enemy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Realizing his mistake, the commander had a dumbfounded expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  The woman looked at the commander with a flirtatious gaze.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Commander, you were trusted with this position by the leader, and you betray us like this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, I… argh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, black blood flowed from the captain’s eyes, nose, and ears, and soon he collapsed onto the floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, after twitching, his movements stopped. He was dead.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha, what a death befitting a bug.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The woman’s gaze turned towards me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh my, a handsome man. Won’t you play with me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  The old man burst into laughter and stepped forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ahaha! Welcome, warriors of Niflheimr. I am Uruka Dije, an advisor of the Union Guild. I look forward to working with you!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m Siha Niatra, in charge of beauty in the Union Guild. Nice to meet you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Siha winked at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  The young man with the pale complexion said nothing.
 </p>

  “You might think you’ve won against us, but don’t be mistaken. These are just a small part of our forces. They’re as insignificant as bugs.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Siha swayed her large chest as she walked forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uhuhu, I am a witch cursed with seven plagues, an incarnation of immortality. An eternal witch who is not permitted to die. I shall grant you a painful and beautiful death, the absolute…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack!
 </p>
 <p>
  Lightning struck, and Siha’s upper body disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her lower body, left behind, trembled and then collapsed to the side.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oops, shot her by mistake.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Nihaku, having returned at some point, smiled sheepishly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Uruka smiled warmly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry. She won’t die from this. Come on, get up, we have guests waiting.”

  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  Twitch, twitch.
 </p>
 <p>
  The legs that showcased her figure trembled and then slumped.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then they moved no more.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……Why aren’t you getting up?”
 </p>

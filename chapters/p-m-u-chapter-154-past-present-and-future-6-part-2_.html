  “Master, I’ve brought warm tea and cookies. Coffee? Tea?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Coffee.”

  “As you wish.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A small table and chairs appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sat down and drank the coffee Yurnet had poured for me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Look! I grew even stronger. Eventually, I will make all the worlds kneel before me!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Nord Lv.164]
 </p>
 <p>
  I savored the coffee while observing him.
 </p>
 <p>
  His level rose each time his body recovered.
 </p>
 <p>
  A fascinating trait indeed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not just that. He’s gaining resistance to being cut.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Augh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This swill is terrible.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s not swill; it’s coffee, a delicacy from Earth.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ptui, it’s so bitter. I don’t see the appeal.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I watched, nibbling on a cookie.
 </p>
 <p>
  The level and resistance increase with each regeneration.
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed, he seemed capable of annihilating a guild on his own.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How does it taste? I baked them myself.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Too sweet.”

  “Is that so. In the future, I will…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Argh! You bastards! What kind of party are you throwing in front of others!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Nord charged at us with his eyes flashing red.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a flash of Ridgion’s sword, his limbs were sliced apart. Nord, regenerating in less than a second, extended a demonic arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll you kill all…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t interfere.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, Nord’s body was flung tens of meters away, rolling on the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet smiled gently.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Continue, Ridgion. Until the Master is satisfied.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s the plan.”

 <p>
  Ridgion laughed heartily, his sword hanging down.
 </p>
 <p>
  “These bastards, I will definitely kill them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A deep murderous intent flashed in Nord’s eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he reached out his hand, the pool of blood gathered into his shadow.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Nord Lv.176]
 </p>
 <p>
  His level rose again.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed he had absorbed the essence of the corpses.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm. An interesting ability. Intern!!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Y-yes?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you doing? Record this. It’s valuable data.”

 <p>
  [Oh, right!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle hurriedly opened her notebook and started writing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nord roared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not only his right arm but every part of his body from his limbs to his chest started to transform into a demon.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Transformation is possible too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ah, transformation is possible. Note that!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You jerks!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The young man, now fully transformed into a monster except for his face, roared.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was about 3 meters tall. His skin, covering his muscles, rippled, exerting an immense pressure, it felt as if a lion was facing a mouse.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…How ugly.”

 <p>
  Ridgion adjusted his sword expressionlessly.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Nord moved, shockwaves erupted, crushing and destroying the surrounding objects. Ridgion, moving as light as a feather, inscribed slashes on the demon’s steel-like skin.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems the test subject’s resistance to slashing has reached its limit. About 90% resistance.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [90% resistance? But he’s cutting through it like butter?]
 </p>
 <p>
  I typed on the virtual keyboard.
 </p>
 <p>
  Loki&gt; Where did this guy come from?
 </p>
 <p>
  Kaiser did not respond.
 </p>
 <p>
  Doesn’t want to talk, huh? Or…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is he unable to respond?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I watched Nord.

 <p>
  Despite appearing to press Ridgion hard, the reality was quite the opposite.
 </p>
 <p>
  From the beginning, it was like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nord’s attacks couldn’t even graze Ridgion’s clothing, let alone damage him. Despite his level and resistance rising with each regeneration, the situation did not improve after dozens of recoveries.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Even though he’s being given a lot of leeway.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was one of the reasons I decided to leave Niflheimr.
 </p>
 <p>
  Being with these guys skews your sense of power.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Nord Lv.185]
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems this is the limit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet spoke up.
 </p>

 <p>
  True to her words, his level wasn’t increasing anymore.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master, we’ve collected enough data. If we analyze it back home, I believe we’ll find meaningful results.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let him go. It’s pitiful.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “As you command. Ridgion!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I heard you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridgion, who had been engaging Nord, stepped back.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nord, with a wild roar, charged in. His steel-like claws, nearly 1 meter long, gleamed threateningly.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a single strike, Nord’s entire body was sliced into dozens of pieces.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was getting tired of playing.”

 <p>
  Ridgion spoke in an unimpressed tone.
 </p>
 <p>
  Like being put through a blender, the sliced pieces of meat didn’t move an inch.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was over in one blow.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s done, Master.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The victorious Ridgion bowed to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…You did well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A sword is meant to look good in front of the Master.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It wasn’t that great.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridgion then stood behind me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I finished the rest of my coffee.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How’s the situation elsewhere?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Currently, the 1st, 3rd, and 7th fleets are infiltrating the Union Guild’s base. The situation is smooth. There are resisting groups, but no casualties on our side.”
 </p>
 <p>
  On the operation screen to my right.
 </p>
 <p>
  Blue dots were attacking the red dots, encircling them.
 </p>
 <p>
  I touched the tactical tool and rearranged the fleet. Then, I slightly adjusted the attack formation, and that was it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There’s not much strategy needed.’
 </p>
 <p>
  After all, we could just crush them without any special tactics.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unique tactics that others don’t usually use require a certain level of risk. There’s a reason these tactics aren’t standard.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Sun Tzu said.
 </p>
 <p>
  Win first, then fight.

  ‘Keep the distance and suppress with superior range.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The technological gap.
 </p>
 <p>
  The range of our firepower is almost twice that of the enemy’s.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the enemies approach, order a retreat; if they flee, advance.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s a very basic tactic, but it’s effective for that reason.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘In asymmetric warfare, victory is a must.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The quality of our heroes is overwhelming.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the Master’s screen, Myuden, flying on a spear, was successively destroying the enemy’s key airships. Next to him was…
 </p>
 <p>
  A familiar figure was swinging his spear alongside Myuden.
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t help but laugh.

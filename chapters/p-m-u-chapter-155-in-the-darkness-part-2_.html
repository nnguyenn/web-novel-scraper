  Yurnet stood beside me.
 </p>
 <p>
  This girl had more information resources than I imagined.

  Not just in Mobius. She’s renowned as a skilled hacker on Earth too. Apparently, magical formulas and hacking codes have similarities.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Kaiser32’ and ‘Nord Sickle’]
 </p>
 <p>
  The report’s introduction came to mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  I started scrolling down.
 </p>
 <p>
  First, Kaiser32.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Name – Seo Tae-jun]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Age – 32]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Origin – Earth, South Korea, Seoul]
 </p>
 <p>
  His personal details were recorded alongside a photo.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, he was 32 because of his age.
 </p>
 <p>
  Quite the sense of humor. I chuckled lightly as I continued reading.
 </p>
 <p>
  Born with a silver, no, a diamond spoon with his history of spending millions in games.
 </p>
 <p>
  The third son of the Changshin Group. Changshin Group is one of the top conglomerates in Korea. Originally, he was to inherit one of the associates and live a luxurious life, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He was ousted in the succession battle.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Caught in the crossfires of power struggles, he was pushed out and sent to live in the provinces with nothing but his wealth.
 </p>
 <p>
  And so, he turned to gaming. Investing millions into every game, he dominated the rankings as if it were child’s play.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He threw money around, playing the king among his circle of acquaintances.

 <p>
  Testimonies of his distinctive influence were attached to the report.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unable to exert such power in real life, he desired to be the king at least in the virtual world.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The fifth game was L.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Famous for its exorbitant spending policies.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘After conquering L, he moved on to Pick Me Up with his clan members…’
 </p>
 <p>
  That was three months ago in real-time.
 </p>
 <p>
  What followed was as I knew. He splurged on heroes, climbing the ranks through looting and destruction until he was utterly defeated by Niflheimr.
 </p>
 <p>
  To think she could even dig up the master’s origins.
 </p>
 <p>
  I clicked my tongue and said,
 </p>
 <p>
  “How did you find out all of this?”

 <p>
  “Well, since it’s recorded on Mobius’s server…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet cleared her throat before continuing,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master, the next part might be shocking. Please brace yourself.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you mean?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kaiser32’s current situation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…’
 </p>
 <p>
  I think I know where this is going.
 </p>
 <p>
  What became of him.
 </p>
 <p>
  I scrolled down.
 </p>
 <p>
  The next page of the report was blank.

 <p>
  But slowly, the noise began to creep onto the screen, and a black-and-white video started playing.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Cam. 32]
 </p>
 <p>
  A dark room.
 </p>
 <p>
  The curtains were drawn, and the door was firmly closed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not a single light entered the space.
 </p>
 <p>
  The only thing in the room was a solitary bed.
 </p>
 <p>
  And on the bed…
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s this video?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s from a hospital. The security was quite tight, so it was challenging to get through.”
 </p>

  “CCTV footage.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Changshin General Hospital, basement level 3.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That man is…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seo Tae-jun, 32 years old. He was declared brain dead about a month ago.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So, it was as I suspected.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Various pieces of the puzzle, which I only had suspicions about, clicked into place.
 </p>
 <p>
  I smirked bitterly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where’s my body then?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m sorry. That’s something we haven’t been able to find out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I thought so. Alright.”
 </p>

  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just give me a moment. I’d like to be alone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Excuse me, then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet bowed and left the room.
 </p>
 <p>
  I placed my hand on the table. The man in the video was sleeping like the dead.
 </p>
 <p>
  In reality, that’s probably what he was. Being brain-dead meant he was nothing more than a living corpse.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So Kaiser32 and Nord were the same person after all.’
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s no other explanation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Half-hero, half-master. The condition for becoming a seven-star, as Yurnet once explained.
 </p>
 <p>
  As I sorted through the information,
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-7" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  ‘The more engrossed a master becomes in the game, the closer they get to Mobius.’
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s why, as the floors get higher, the concentration of interference grows.
 </p>
 <p>
  Like what Anytng is experiencing now. Heroes become stronger, and missions can be more significantly influenced.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Heaven-defying Book.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even the name was nonsensical.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Defying (逆) Heaven (天).’
 </p>
 <p>
  I see.
 </p>
 <p>
  The condition to become a seven-star was simple.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The fusion of hero and master.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In the process, the master dies.
 </p>

 <p>
  Just like Seo Tae-jun ended up a corpse on that bed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘From the first to the fourth rank.’
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s almost no publicly known information about them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Only that they’ve reached floor 90. But it wasn’t always like this. There were a few who were treated like celebrities on community sites back in the day. I even received help from one when I was a newbie.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They vanished all of a sudden.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Did they die?
 </p>
 <p>
  Among them was a genius I even admired.
 </p>
 <p>
  If Kaiser32 is dead, then Nord was the actual leader of the Union.
 </p>
 <p>
  After obtaining the power of a seven-star, he invaded Niflheimr pretending to be a master.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There was a justification.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if someone familiar with Seo Tae-jun’s situation appeared, they could simply claim it was autonomous action.
 </p>
 <p>
  The accounts above me were no different.
 </p>
 <p>
  I closed my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her voice slowly rewound in my mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  The one who summoned me here. That irksome voice is still clear.
 </p>
 <p>
  「You can’t possibly believe that. You are a special being. This place is a gift for you. A stage prepared for you, the glorious ranker of Pick Me Up.」
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…’
 </p>
 <p>
  「Don’t hate too much. Your summoning to Mobius was also unexpected for me. An unforeseen accident.」
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…’
 </p>
 <p>
  「You were the only one who truly realized the meaning of those words. Among a hundred million masters, you were the only one.」

 </p>
 <p>
  All of it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Smooth talk.
 </p>
 <p>
  I wasn’t summoned by him.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was just an accident. Her intention from the start was singular.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘To kill me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seris would have been the target for fusion.
 </p>
 <p>
  The purpose is obvious.
 </p>
 <p>
  A seven-star.

 <p>
  For that reason, she opened the Supreme Advent Dungeon in my account.
 </p>
 <p>
  However due to some unknown cause, the fusion failed, and I survived.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, she thought it over.
 </p>
 <p>
  To recycle me.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Quite the frugal one.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Would make a great housewife, don’t you think?
 </p>
 <p>
  Isn’t that right?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Tel.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I muttered the name of the person I knew.

 <p>
  Two days had passed since I received the analysis on Nord.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you really going?”

 <p>
  Yurnet asked with a forlorn expression, looking down.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was stepping onto the airship bound for Townia.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Should I stay then?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No way? I need to go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re too much.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet glanced at me sideways.
 </p>
 <p>
  I smirked and stepped up the stairs.
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t stay in Niflheimr.
 </p>
 <p>
  Staying here would make me complacent. I could never move forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were things I had to take responsibility for in Townia too.
 </p>
 <p>
  My second visit to Niflheimr wasn’t long, but I had achieved some meaningful results.
 </p>
 <p>
  Firstly, I was able to raise my intermediate weapon skills to level 5 through duels with Ridgion.
 </p>
 <p>
  Secondly…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Incredible.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I had managed to grasp an outline of the method to ascend to a 7-star.
 </p>
 <p>
  The synthesis of a master and a hero. I can’t be 100% sure. However, the completed hypothesis matched the information I had. It’s over 90% likely to be correct.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Trustworthy my foot.’

 <p>
  I chuckled bitterly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet, Ridgion, and Nihaku came to see me off at the launch pad.
 </p>
 <p>
  I can’t rely solely on those guys. If I don’t become stronger, it’s all for naught.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll be waiting.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridgion bowed his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nihaku waved her hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come again next time!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m not sure when that’ll be.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Once a week seems reasonable, doesn’t it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can’t come that often.”

 <p>
  “Ah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The stairs carrying me went up to the deck.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master, don’t forget to contact us this time, please.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I entered the airship, ignoring Yurnet’s warning-not-warning.
 </p>
 <p>
  The airship began to move. The guide this time was also Lydel.
 </p>
 <p>
  It would take a day to arrive.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to change the operation method in Townia.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Late at night, I spread out some papers on the desk in my cabin.
 </p>
 <p>
  The current structure of Townia was drawn on them.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s a three-story building.’

 <p>
  Initially, heroes are assigned to the first floor upon summoning.
 </p>
 <p>
  They live almost like beggars, eating only potatoes and water for a while.
 </p>
 <p>
  Only after obtaining their roles do they move up to the second floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though it’s a significant advancement from the early days of the waiting room, where everyone lived on one floor and controlled heroes through synthesis,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s still lacking.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s somewhat primitive.
 </p>
 <p>
  The scale of heroes has grown as large as it can, approaching 200 members.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s almost like a large village now.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘We’ll increase it to at least 300.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The rate of hero consumption in missions is too violent.
 </p>

 <p>
  The reason is simple. An unexpectedly ridiculous difficulty level.
 </p>
 <p>
  If this trend continues, many will die in each mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  To quickly replenish the forces, we need to increase the pool of heroes.
 </p>
 <p>
  For that…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Anytng better do a good job.’
 </p>
 <p>
  My guide of strategies, named “The Book of Sky” by Iselle, includes such intermediate operational methods.
 </p>
 <p>
  The core remains the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you do well, you rise; if not, you fall.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just maintain the basics while adding a bit of seasoning.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There are two viable operation models.’

 <p>
  The model I used in Niflheimr and the one once used by the legend who was ranked No. 1.
 </p>
 <p>
  His active period was long before I became a ranker.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was a true genius. If my guess is correct, he’s no longer alive.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…’
 </p>
 <p>
  As I pondered, time flew by rapidly.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;We have arrived!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  I opened my eyes to Lydel’s announcement.
 </p>
 <p>
  A message indicating the location appeared on the right side of my view.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dimension 1935 – Townia]
 </p>
 <p>
  Townia.

  As I stepped onto the deck, the airship was entering the dimensional whirlwind.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing me, Lydel saluted with a respectful tilt.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It was an honor to serve you!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Honor, my foot. Don’t overdo it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “By the way, when will you return to Niflheimr…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lydel looked at me with a hopeful, yet subtly expectant gaze.
 </p>
 <p>
  Was it Yurnet’s doing, or just pure sentiment?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who knows.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I lightly dodged the question.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then.

 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han(★★★)’ is now under your control.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [※The hero’s status has changed due to the dispatch effect. For more details, check the ‘Hero’ tab!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Landgrid07 docked in the dimensional gap.
 </p>
 <p>
  I stepped back into the waiting room, receiving Lydel’s salute.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Booom.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not long after, the airship disappeared from view.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked up.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sky was tinged with a gloomy light.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng was not connected; judging by the color, it was late evening.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sound of my footsteps echoed hollowly on the metallic floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took a deep breath of air.
 </p>
 <p>
  Exiting the dimensional gap, I headed straight to the second-floor plaza and then climbed the stairs to the third floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was dark.
 </p>
 <p>
  The lights in the plaza were off.
 </p>

 <p>
  I hadn’t encountered anyone on my way here.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though it was late, it was an unusual situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  As I was about to enter my quarters, the stairs leading to the fourth floor caught my eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They’ve built a fourth floor.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It seems the waiting room has changed in my absence.
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned and stepped onto the stairs to the fourth floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon, the panorama of the fourth-floor plaza was revealed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fundamentally, it was similar to other plazas.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the difference was that it had expanded to the size of a large sports field, and instead of pathways leading to dormitories or training centers, an unfamiliar building stood.
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled to myself.

 <p>
  A luxurious mansion that seemed straight out of a photograph stood there.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was three stories tall, surrounded by a fence.
 </p>
 <p>
  I think I understand Anytng’s intention.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had built a private residence for me.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…This is unexpected.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I opened the mansion’s front door and entered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the spacious hall, fanfare erupted, and then.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Congratulations, Loki!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle, wearing a party hat, flew towards me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Following her, the interior of the hall was revealed. The walls, decorated with balloons and paper, had a garish banner on the left side saying, “Congratulations on Your Appointment!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s all this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Poo! Poo!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle blew a party whistle that shot out pieces of paper.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m going to bed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Wait, wait! Please! I worked hard on this!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle hurriedly flew towards me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s all this about?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s a celebration of Loki’s appointment!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Appointment?”
 </p>

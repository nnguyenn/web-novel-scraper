 <p>
  [Wait, wait! Please! I worked hard on this!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle hurriedly flew towards me.
 </p>

 <p>
  “What’s all this about?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s a celebration of Loki’s appointment!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Appointment?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle waved her hand in a circle, and a past system log appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  A hologram window decorated in white, with a blue potion bottle icon.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the research tab.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ding!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Research, ‘Hero Responsiveness,’ has reached Lv.10.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Following that, a guidance message appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You can now appoint a ‘Sub Master’!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Sub Master acts as the Master’s deputy, overseeing the waiting room’s operations and battles, and assisting in the Master’s tower conquest.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tips/Sub Master is granted broader authority. Depending on the situation, the Sub Master can autonomously strategize for tower conquests. Experience the limits of AI that mimics human intelligence!]
 </p>
 <p>
  I could guess the rest of the log without seeing it.
 </p>
 <p>
  I closed the hologram window.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yep, from now on, Loki is the Sub Master of Townia!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t see why you’re making such a fuss about it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A lethargic Velkist yawned as he walked out.
 </p>

 <p>
  Beside him were the figures of Jenna and Neryssa. Edis was there too.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you all doing here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I was flabbergasted.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Everyone’s here to celebrate… ack!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle’s cheeks were pulled mercilessly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this your doing?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [No, no, I just… I was worried Han might leave Townia…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t be so mean. That fairy did it thinking of you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis walked out with a smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Congratulations, Han. You’ve been recognized.”

 <p>
  [Ahem, don’t get cocky now. Your ranks are different now, you know!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Should I start using honorifics? Han-nim.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I might die from cringing, so let’s not.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you say so.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edith laughed and stepped back.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at Iselle.
 </p>
 <p>
  She was fidgeting with her hands clasped.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’re a Sub Master now… don’t go anywhere strange.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Was there an issue?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Well, I heard that a new lucky person entered Niflheimr…]

 <p>
  Iselle whispered so only I could hear.
 </p>
 <p>
  I smirked. She was worrying over nothing.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It must have been Iselle who recommended me as the Sub Master.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a completely different matter from just showing tips.
 </p>
 <p>
  She must have put in a lot of effort.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t it something to celebrate?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna spoke up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Being a Sub Master is the highest position here, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ahem, except for the Master.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I knew I picked the right line.”
 </p>

 <p>
  Jenna winked at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I said despairingly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this why you all gathered? To offer congratulations?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ve been looking down lately. Since that incident.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That incident being…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka, perhaps.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sis wouldn’t blame you. If I were her, I’d feel the same. You don’t have to blame yourself.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I never did.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then that settles it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna chuckled and backed away.
 </p>

 <p>
  “I’m sleepy. Can I go to bed now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stay put.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa stepped on Velkist’s foot.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But being a Sub Master, is there anything special about it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not really. It’s not something to celebrate.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s tiresome.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I scratched my head.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now that Anytng had appointed me as Sub Master, he would be sure to dump various troublesome tasks on me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, it was necessary.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked around the room.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-7" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  The assembly members were Jenna, Velkist, and Neryssa from the first party, and Edis from the second party.
 </p>
 <p>
  Additionally, Iselle was included. They were the core members responsible for Townia.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s a pity Kishasha isn’t here.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It seems more time is needed.
 </p>
 <p>
  I brushed the confetti off my head and sat down on a chair.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sit down, everyone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A party?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hardly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I laughed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’d be a hassle to gather everyone again later. I’m just telling you in advance.”
 </p>

 <p>
  Members took their seats around the rectangular table one by one.
 </p>
 <p>
  I spread the papers on the table, drawn with the current structure of the waiting room. Although it had become a four-story building, explaining the situation should be no problem.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s this paper for?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s the structure of our current waiting room. You know, the situation has changed from before. It’s crowded with more kids.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I pointed to the first floor of the waiting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There are nearly 150 heroes staying on the first floor, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes! Nothing much has changed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “We need new combat members. We lost a bunch on the 35th floor. And this will only continue from now on.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I pointed to the third floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, it’s practically the fourth floor now.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We need to change the operating method to smoothly supply forces and for future mission raids.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t that the Master’s job?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course, that guy will handle the main tasks. But with the huge increase in personnel, it will become difficult for him to manage alone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Appointing me as Sub Master was also out of necessity.
 </p>
 <p>
  When the number of people was small, it was possible to look after each one and decide on their use. But now, the situation is different.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even when the numbers were small, Anytng wasn’t able to make efficient decisions.
 </p>
 <p>
  After all, he wasn’t watching the heroes 24 hours a day.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It was necessary after all.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was even overdue.
 </p>
 <p>
  I opened my mouth.
 </p>

 <p>
  “What’s needed for one ruler to efficiently command many?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The faces of the members hardened.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist, with his arms crossed, spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you mean…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are we acknowledging the Master as our ruler?”
 </p>
 <p>
  There.
 </p>
 <p>
  He didn’t hesitate to probe.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I nodded.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-15" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  Velkist frowned unhappily.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I heard the Master considers us mere pawns on a chessboard. To him, we’re just toys, whether we live or die. Plus, we’re being pushed into these dog-like missions because of him, aren’t we?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re not wrong.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “And you want us to help him? I can’t agree.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist looked up at the ceiling with a cold laugh.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sky was in that direction.
 </p>
 <p>
  “All this time, it was my desire for improvement that kept me alive. If there was anything else, it would be your help, senior.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Has that Master ever helped me? All he does is watch from above and throw us into battle. If you were the Master, I might have agreed. But not him. In my eyes, he’s incompetent. Unlike you, senior.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist sneered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then Edis raised her hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “From what I know, we were dragged here because of the Master. We were basically kidnapped.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kidnapped.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was also not wrong.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We follow because we don’t want to die, we want to live. But if we consider him our ruler, it changes the meaning. It means we’re cooperating voluntarily.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s be clear. Forget being a Sub Master or whatever. It’s like a slave bragging about their chains.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I disagree.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist’s expression soured.
 </p>
 <p>
  The disappointment in his gaze turned towards Neryssa.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I think we should help the Master.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is disappointing. I didn’t expect this from you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t judge emotionally. You look like a fool.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is there a guarantee of reward? Are we supposed to help that bastard who might change his mind and kill us?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is the way for us to live.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s hilarious.”
 </p>
 <p>
  An argument erupted between them.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ah, wait, why is this happening? We’re here to celebrate Han’s return!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle fluttered her wings in a panic.
 </p>
 <p>
  I laughed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, as expected.

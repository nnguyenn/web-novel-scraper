 <p>
  The structure of the waiting room had changed much more than I had expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  From the 3rd to the 4th floor, it wasn’t just an increase in the number of floors. A school containing the entire training facility had been established, and every facility from the warehouse to the equipment manufacturing shop had been upgraded by one level.

 </div>
 <p>
  A foundation for systematic operation had been established.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were changes in the luxury accommodations on the 4th floor as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each party was allocated a mansion.
 </p>
 <p>
  The mansion included not only private rooms but also a large dining hall, a lounge, a bathhouse, and a private training room. There was no longer a need to go anywhere else.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If one more thing was added.’
 </p>
 <p>
  An office had been created.
 </p>
 <p>
  A wooden desk and chair, and drawers for stacking documents.
 </p>
 <p>
  The desk was piled high with papers. These papers contained various matters regarding the waiting room, investigated by prospective administrators.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What, what is this? Who are you!”
 </p>
 <p>
  In front of the desk, a man scowled fiercely.
 </p>
 <p>
  The man was on his knees, and Velkist stood behind him with an indifferent expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this the guy?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist answered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mark Kellain. Correct?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You, you bastard, acting tough just because you’re a bit strong, but even rats and birds… Ah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thwack!
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist continued speaking after slapping Mark’s cheek.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Answer the question I asked.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You damn… to think you’ll be safe after this… Cough!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist began to beat the man mercilessly.
 </p>
 <p>
  A merciless flurry of blows. Blood and broken teeth scattered on the floor of the office.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I watched the man with my hands resting on the table.
 </p>
 <p>
  This hero in front of my eyes, named Mark, belonged to the 1st floor. Two months ago in waiting room time, he was summoned here as a 2-star hero. But his actions afterward were somewhat unusual.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike other heroes who chose to train and become stronger, he chose to remain on the 1st floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sto, stop…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Mark, with a bruised face, mumbled.
 </p>

 <p>
  Velkist snickered and then kicked his face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ack!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You won’t die from this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you planning to kill me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That wouldn’t be too bad, right? You’re trash anyway.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He’s trash indeed.’
 </p>
 <p>
  This guy, seizing the moment when the Master’s attention was elsewhere, organized a special gang on the 1st floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  What was its name again? I can’t quite remember. But one thing is clear…
 </p>
 <p>
  “You diverted and hid items from the waiting room, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I spoke up.
 </p>

 <p>
  “No…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t say no. I know everything. I’ve just been turning a blind eye until now. It would have been fine if it were just diversion. But assault, threats, robbery. You’ve committed every crime there is.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I glanced at the testimony.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was written by a female hero belonging to the 1st floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mark, after silently bowing his head, began to sob.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Damn it, to hell with this…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Crying out as if lamenting.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you want me to do! They dragged us to a place like this, to fight and die! If you didn’t want that, you shouldn’t have summoned me in the first place. Do you think I wanted this! Making us eat potatoes three times a day, what do you expect…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thwack!
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist slapped Mark’s face again.
 </p>

 <p>
  The fallen man did not get up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The trash dares to talk back too. How should we deal with this? Perhaps synthesis?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I believe there are a few more people.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “All have been caught. They won’t be much different from this one.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well done. I did well to leave it to you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well done my foot. Don’t ask me to do this again. It’s annoying to death.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist spat out.
 </p>
 <p>
  The task I had given him was to eliminate the gang created on the 1st floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were more like thugs than a gang. Active stealthily when the Master was not connected, extorting items from other heroes, and committing various crimes.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ve left them alone because we were busy elsewhere.’
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  But now, the situation is different.
 </p>
 <p>
  Previously, heroes were summoned and then left to fend for themselves in the waiting room. Now, from the moment of summoning, education and management are introduced. The goal is efficient training and motivation. Mandatory education is implemented.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Soon laws will be established too.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, it’s not complicated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kill and you die.
 </p>
 <p>
  Steal from the Master and you die.
 </p>
 <p>
  Do anything harmful to the waiting room and you die.
 </p>
 <p>
  Townia changed from being a simple gathering of heroes to a group with rules and discipline.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the Sub-Master stands at its apex.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Senior, are you planning to continue with such troublesome work?”
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-7" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  Velkist, wiping his bloody hands, asked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t think I can focus on training.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re right. It’s getting busy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Busier than imagined.
 </p>
 <p>
  I haven’t finished skill training yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  At this pace, I’ll be stuck in the office without being able to move an inch.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t it a loss?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It would be nice if there were someone suitable to entrust it to…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sub-Master is the strongest in the waiting room and the most beloved hero, but fundamentally, a delegate is appointed to handle the work. Time was too tight to juggle training and work.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I feel the same. I haven’t even touched my sword today.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “I’ll find someone and get you off this job quickly. It won’t take long.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The beginning is us setting an example.
 </p>
 <p>
  After that, it’s not possible. We are the main raid team, after all.
 </p>
 <p>
  We had to find administrators to manage the waiting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  That role is currently being handled by Neryssa.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anyway, leave it to me. I will sort it out within three days.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist dragged Mark out of the office.
 </p>
 <p>
  Left alone, I sighed deeply and picked up the documents.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The daily yield of iron ore is…’
 </p>
 <p>
  I pulled out a white paper and began to write with a blue ink pen.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was making a report to submit to the Master.
 </p>
 <p>
  And that evening,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Welcome to Pick Me Up!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Loading is complete.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [T O U C H ! (Select)]
 </p>
 <p>
  The sky beyond the window brightened.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng had logged in.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Master is the sky, huh?
 </p>
 <p>
  I sat in the chair and crossed my legs.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I eat that guy, I could become the Master of Townia.’

 <p>
  My climbing speed would increase several times.
 </p>
 <p>
  The detailed method… Well, I’m sure I’ll find it out as I go along.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Nonsense.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I laughed bitterly.

  [Master, there is an unverified report.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Reporter – Sub-Master: ‘Han(★★★)’]

 <p>
  [Would you like to verify?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes(Select) / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  The document appeared in the Master’s operation window.
 </p>
 <p>
  The document displayed the content I had written with the ink pen.
 </p>
 <p>
  The report was 23 pages long.
 </p>
 <p>
  Quite lengthy. From the basic matters of the waiting room to the change in the training system, the identification of criminals, and proposals for future operations.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tips/Special roles assigned to heroes allow them to ‘report’ and ‘suggest’ to the Master. To expand the role, further research into ‘Hero Responsiveness’ at a higher level is required.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Sub-Master, ‘Han(★★★)’ suggests the public execution of ‘Mark(★★)’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Sub-Master, ‘Han(★★★)’ proposes the creation of a new hero profession, ‘Administrator’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Sub-Master, ‘Han(★★★)’…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng started to touch ‘Yes’ recklessly from the middle.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether it was trust in me or just laziness to read, I couldn’t tell.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I received ten.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I placed the statues given by Anytng in the display case.
 </p>
 <p>
  Two spaces were filled with warhorse statues.
 </p>
 <p>
  976 more to reach a thousand.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seems I’ll need to make about fifty-five-story display cases.

  ‘…Was I always such a cheap person?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, it doesn’t matter.
 </p>
 <p>
  As long as it’s fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  I whistled as I left the office.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng was performing various tasks according to my report.
 </p>
 <p>
  It must be quite a headache. The operation area has become several times more complicated following my suggestions. Before, it was just a few simple tasks to manage.
 </p>
 <p>
  It can’t be helped.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it’s ordinary, it’ll just be the same as others.
 </p>
 <p>
  To climb higher, there’s no choice but to endure more hardship.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But…’
 </p>

 <p>
  There is a possibility.
 </p>
 <p>
  In such a state, there are more than a few Masters who throw everything away because it’s complicated and bothersome.
 </p>
 <p>
  But not Anytng, he didn’t give up and steadily been doing it. It has been like that since the first 4-star was lost. His mental strength and perseverance were admirable.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Otherwise, I would have given up long ago.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Or I would have been dead.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a gamble, but it worked out well.
 </p>
 <p>
  Being summoned by this guy was also a stroke of luck. While seeming clumsy, everything that needs to be done is done. If Anytng had been hated by the heroes, we wouldn’t have come this far.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the Master was handling the work, I decided to do something else.
 </p>
 <p>
  I equipped myself lightly and left the mansion.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the opposite side of the square, another mansion was situated. It was the exclusive lodging for Party 2.
 </p>

 <p>
  As I entered through the door, Edis in casual clothes came out.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, you’re here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where are the newbies?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They’re waiting in the reception room. They wanted to see you too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I followed Edis to the reception room on the 2nd floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Two people were sitting demurely at the table in the neatly decorated inner room.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were the new members of Party 2, filling the spots of the retired Roderick and the deceased Lilinia.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s see, their names were…’
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the summoning logs of the two that I had opened beforehand.

 <p>
  It was the history of Anytng doing paid summons in my absence.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Talak, Durururu!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Thwack!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Rare!]
 </p>
 <p>

 <p>
  [Thwack!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Rare!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master ‘Anytng’ has acquired the hero ‘Maine(★★★)’!]
 </p>
 <p>
  A double summon.
 </p>
 <p>
  But even here, luck played a role.

  [Ding!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [A strong connection is felt between the two summoned heroes.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The bond ‘The Double Harmony of Wind and Ice’ has been formed!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Just from the ‘Bond Name,’ it’s evident.
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned my gaze to the table.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oppa Han is here!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As if planned, the two voices overlapped.
 </p>
 <p>
  A
  <br/>
  chirping high tone.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I am Raine.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I am Maine!”

 <p>
  The two stood up from their seats and bowed to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Both were girls who looked to be barely in their twenties.
 </p>
 <p>
  Their slightly wavy hair reached their waists.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t be so formal. Just sit down.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The two sat on the sofa.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sat on the opposite sofa and bluntly began.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You two.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are magicians.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course!”
 </p>

 <p>
  Their immediate response.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Twins.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Excluding their hair color, their appearances were almost identical.
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis, who was sitting next to me pouring tea, spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Raine specializes in wind, and Maine in ice elemental magic.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right, sister. We were quite famous in the north.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The blue-haired girl, Maine, smiled brightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They’ve gone through a demonstration battle. Both are excellent. They will be a great help in future battles.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s expected.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Since they are magicians.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each elemental magic has its own advantages depending on the attribute.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fire Magic has the strongest single-target firepower but can cause damage to allies, consumes a lot of mana, and has poor sustain in battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Wind and ice coming together…’
 </p>
 <p>
  And as a bond.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s an incredibly rare event.
 </p>
 <p>
  They are not polar opposites like fire and Ice.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘We’ve hit the jackpot.’
 </p>
 <p>
  So far, Anytng has done several paid summons, but this is the first time we’ve been this lucky.
 </p>
 <p>
  The other newly summoned advanced heroes are probably undergoing their initiation on the 3rd floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But, Han.”
 </p>

 <p>
  While pondering over the combination of the two, Edis whispered to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is it okay to put two magicians in Party 2? This concentrates the power too much.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s true.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You said so before. It’s better to distribute the power evenly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  I did say something like that. Equal distribution of power. My thoughts on that haven’t changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, that was in ordinary situations.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Townia’s mission composition is anything but ordinary.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ve realized this after going through several boss stages.
 </p>
 <p>
  First, the difficulty is absurd. Moreover, the basic specs required of the main raid team are enormous.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-15" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  A basic ten-to-one is the norm. In such situations…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s impossible to divide the power fairly.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A different approach is necessary.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was my suggestion to include the two in Party 2. Anytng agreed to it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll have to change the raid strategy. This way won’t work.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Create a throwaway team.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis blinked in surprise.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took a sip of water before speaking.
 </p>
 <p>
  “From now on, all members except for Party 1 and 2 are disposable.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What? That’s…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Think of them as something to be used and discarded.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wa, wait! What if the roles are divided like on the 20th floor?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll cover that. We don’t have magicians for nothing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis seemed not to understand.
 </p>
 <p>
  I finished my tea.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it’s impossible to divide the power the only option is to gather more.
 </p>
 <p>
  Overwhelmingly. To ensure we won’t fall in any situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Other parties are just there to ‘buy time’.
 </p>
 <p>
  I finished all of my tea.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Kishasha.’
 </p>
 <p>
  First, we need that girl.

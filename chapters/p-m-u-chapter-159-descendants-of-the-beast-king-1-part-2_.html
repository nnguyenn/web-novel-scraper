 <p>
  I drew my sword from its sheath.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the darkness, the blade gleamed coldly.

 <p>
  “You cowardly b$tch.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Iselle, I’ll make it clear. Don’t interfere.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned the blade to the side.
 </p>
 <p>
  The weight was felt on my shoulder.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lowering my lower body, I eyed the direction where Kishasha was and leaped forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  The wind grazed my body.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you doing?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack!
 </p>
 <p>
  The top of the large tree was split open.
 </p>
 <p>
  From among the scattering branches and leaves, a black figure leaped out.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you want to die, die here then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What? Didn’t expect me to come out like this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha jumped to the opposite tree.
 </p>

 <p>
  I won’t miss it. I chased after her across the broken treetops.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sword again drew a curve. The shadow agilely jumped.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It looks like you don’t want to die.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you mad?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I chased Kishasha, breaking and smashing every tree in my path.
 </p>
 <p>
  The heavy sword cleaved through the air, scattering debris from the destroyed forest in all directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Talking big about being a warrior and all. Then why are you whining now? Pathetic.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come at me. I won’t go easy like before.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The trees were in the way.
 </p>

 <p>
  Kishasha, with her unique mobility, jumped between trees, shaking off my sword strikes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then.
 </p>
 <p>
  I struck down every tree in sight.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a loud noise, one side of the forest was erased as if a bulldozer had pushed through it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘As expected, she’s fast.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I grinned bitterly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The leaves fluttered slightly, and in no time, she had moved to the opposite side.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I didn’t think you were like this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A hint of emotion was in her voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  I laughed out loud.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Shut up with your bullshit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Han!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Something long sprouted from the shadow’s arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  I know. I’ve seen it before.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The claws of a beastfolk.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Harder than most steel and with a cutting edge superior to a mechanical cutter.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Scared?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you want to die!”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Still a brat.’
 </p>
 <p>
  My prediction was correct. I spun my body around, swinging my sword.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  A thrilling shock throughout my body.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ground under my feet caved in.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was finally able to face Kishasha.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha was looking at me with blazing eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s been a while.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you thinking?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is what I’m thinking.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I drew a dagger with my left hand and threw it at Kishasha’s left eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha dodged with a head tilt. Twisting her wrist, she shook off the claws and swung diagonally. Kishasha dodged the sword strike with acrobatic movements close to stunts.
 </p>

 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  I kicked her abdomen.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha slid back.
 </p>
 <p>
  I threw daggers one after another.
 </p>
 <p>
  As she dodged, I rushed in again.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Slippery as an eel.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Several sword strikes followed horizontally and vertically.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha dodged the sword strikes by jumping over and climbing with movements akin to gymnastics.
 </p>
 <p>
  But then.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-7" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  [‘Kishasha(★★★★)’ has entered a bleeding state. HP decreases periodically.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha retreated with a groan.
 </p>
 <p>
  I spun the dagger in my left hand. Blood spattered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Does it hurt?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You should endure. You’re just full of bullshit!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I threw the dagger in my hand straight.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aiming for the heart. Kishasha swatted it away with her claws.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment, my sword thrust targeting Kishasha’s groin.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  “……I’m disappointed in you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha kicked the surface of the rising sword blade.
 </p>
 <p>
  Immediately
  <br/>
  afterward, the claws were swung.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  When the claw met the sword blade, sparks, and a loud noise erupted.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Still strong.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ve become several times stronger since then.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the feeling of confrontation remained the same. Deceptive speed. But the movements were efficient. The power in the claws was tremendous. My wrist tingled.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha’s movement pattern began to include attacks.
 </p>
 <p>
  Approaching as if retreating, and retreating as if approaching. Claws-like blades targeted vital points from all directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  One side of my thigh was deeply slashed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Blood gushed out.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han(★★★)’ has entered a bleeding state. HP decreases periodically.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stop here!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thump!
 </p>
 <p>
  I slammed Kishasha’s stomach with the hilt of my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha’s body bent like the letter ‘L’. I hit the back of her head with my elbow and then drove my knee into her.
 </p>
 <p>
  As I was about to tear her throat with my sword, Kishasha jumped back significantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh……”
 </p>

  “Things have changed since last time, have you been fooling around all of this time?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t make me laugh. If I really wanted to…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha spit out blood-stained teeth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re just one hit away from dying.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  Scooping up several handfuls of dirt, Kishasha charged.
 </p>
 <p>
  The claws scraped up from below. I blocked it with a punch-like sword strike. A cannon-like kick aimed at my head. I hurriedly ducked. The right side of my face was numb.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This brat is…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Still strong.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed she shifted up a gear.
 </p>

 <p>
  It was like her body split into several parts due to the speed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The claws began to scratch and wound my entire body, hitting the armor here and there.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this all you’ve got!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The claws barely grazed the skin on my neck.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it had gone a bit deeper, I would have been spilling blood and falling.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Thank goodness we’re in the waiting room.’
 </p>
 <p>
  At least I’m recovering.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha spun in the air, aiming her claws at my lower body and her kick at my upper body.
 </p>
 <p>
  I pulled the sword towards me and swung it long.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  I was pushed back several meters by the terrifying force.
 </p>
 <p>
  Blood flowed from her torn hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  But there was no pursuit.
 </p>
 <p>
  I murmured.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why stop?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s stop here……”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t run. You just know I will kill you if we continue.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha, who was about to turn her back, looked back at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her shoulders twitched, and then her small mouth moved.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Only you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Only you… if it weren’t for you! Han Israt!”
 </p>
 <p>
  My skin prickled.
 </p>
 <p>
  A clear murderous intent.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘She’s really pissed off.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I grinned.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll kill you!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha’s eyes turned red.
 </p>

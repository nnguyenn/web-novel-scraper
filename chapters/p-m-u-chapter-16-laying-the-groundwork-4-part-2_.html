  Aaron’s group returned.
 </p>
 <p>
  No casualties. The five of them went and all five returned. I said:

 <p>
  “Aaron, how many goblins did you take care of?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “One.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He understood my intention.
 </p>
 <p>
  I carefully examined the status windows of the four individuals. Each of their levels had increased by one. It meant that they had somehow participated in the battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the first battle when Aaron and the other two joined us. At that time, me and Jenna fought while the other three watched from behind. Eventually, two of them ended up as sacrifices in the synthesis facility.
 </p>
 <p>
  I knew what will happen to them, but they wouldn’t have understood and didn’t feel the need for it.
 </p>
 <p>
  In that sense, Aaron might have had a different talent than me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is today’s schedule finished?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just a moment, it seems like it’s finished…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle trailed off.
 </p>
 <p>
  The rift had closed, but the light in the sky was still lit.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You can go back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yay!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna was the first to leap up and run towards the dormitory.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron approached me with an uneasy expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hyung-nim, the sky is still bright…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He’s just watching us.”

  Like a god watching over the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  Like a lord inspecting the city.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was observing the process and results of what he had created and achieved. Our voices couldn’t be heard. There was no conversation. This waiting room we were in went through layers of filters, with most of it omitted and only a small portion transmitted to the master. Still, to him, this game would feel like another world.
 </p>
 <p>
  I, too, couldn’t forget the excitement from that time.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you want to keep standing there all day?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I said to the newbies fidgeting behind me.
 </p>
 <p>
  They hesitated but followed along.
 </p>
 <p>
  They entered the dormitory through the door Jenna had opened.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna was sprawled on a leather sofa. She pried it with her hand and then breathed in the scent of the cushion.
 </p>
 <p>
  For now, I decided to leave her alone.

 <p>
  The dormitory had become noticeably more spacious.
 </p>
 <p>
  The living room, which was the first place you saw when you opened the door, had expanded to the point where it could be called a lobby. Even with eleven people, it didn’t feel crowded. The floor was covered in soft carpet, and warm light spilled from the fireplace.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The facilities have definitely improved.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I headed towards the restaurant inside the lobby. A large dining table and chairs were set up between neat interior decorations. There was a kitchen further inside. Display cabinets revealed various cooking utensils such as knives and ladles.
 </p>
 <p>
  I opened the cabinet below.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition to potatoes, there were bottles containing seasonings like salt, sugar, and butter. There were also several types of fruits like apples and grapes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Potatoes are still the main ingredient, huh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, it’s better than just baked potatoes.
 </p>
 <p>
  It will get better as time goes on. When the weekly dungeon opens, we can personally gather cooking ingredients.
 </p>
 <p>
  I returned to the lobby.

  I spoke to the man who was sweating profusely.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You can cook, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, I can…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Recommended List for Cooks!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Dolph (★)’]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Dolph (★)’ as the chef of the restaurant, do you want to appoint him?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes (Select) / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like Anytng is having the same idea.
 </p>
 <p>
  A message appeared, appointing the facility manager.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re in charge of our meals. It’s your responsibility now.”

  “Re… responsibility?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why, don’t you like it? If you don’t, go out and fight like the others.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dolph’s complexion turned pale.
 </p>
 <p>
  He bobbed his head up and down. Dolph also witnessed the two who didn’t return to the plaza.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s dinner for eleven people. Can you handle it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll, I’ll try my best.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dolph stumbled into the kitchen.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re finally saying goodbye to baked potatoes!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna, who had been fidgeting on the sofa, let out a cheer.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the sky again. It seemed like He had no intention of logging out. I couldn’t go back to my room like this. If I opened the door to the dormitory, a clearly different place would appear. I didn’t want to show any odd signs to Anytng.

  “Hyung-nim, isn’t it time to talk to them?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was thinking the same. Since dinner is ready, we can do it while eating.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the number of people increased, there were a few necessary items.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We need a clock.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★)’ wants a ‘clock’ in the dormitory. Will you install it?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [It will consume 3,000 gold.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes (Select) / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  A pendulum clock appeared in a corner of the lobby.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Gasp!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The woman who saw that scene took a sharp breath.

  I checked the current time. It was 6:45 PM. The perfect time.
 </p>
 <p>
  I said:
 </p>
 <p>
  “Everyone gather around. I will explain the rules of this world.”
 </p>
 <p>
  They needed at least some explanation.
 </p>
 <p>
  The waiting room was not a place that functioned solely by one’s own power.
 </p>
 <p>
  We took our seats at the dining table, and a while later, Dolph came out with the food.
 </p>
 <p>
  …It was baked potatoes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna made a disappointed face.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Jenna (★)’ expresses dissatisfaction with the food.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, it’s not my fault. There were no other ingredients.”

  He didn’t even peel the skin off the potato, I had to peel it off myself, so I could take a bite.
 </p>
 <p>
  It had that familiar taste.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★)’ expresses dissatisfaction with the food.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tips/If many heroes express dissatisfaction with the food, try acquiring different ingredients or changing the chef.]
 </p>
 <p>
  I sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had a hunch, and it turned out to be true. Dolph didn’t have any cooking skills in his status window. But just because there were no relevant skills didn’t mean it was impossible.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, it seems he didn’t even bother himself to do a mediocre job.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the contrary, when I quietly observed the other woman, who was probably in her early twenties, with long black hair tied down. The name displayed in her status window was Chloe. And below that, there was a cooking skill attached to her status window, nice and big.

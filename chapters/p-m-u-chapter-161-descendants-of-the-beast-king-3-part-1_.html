 <p>
  The day after, early in the morning.
 </p>
 <p>
  Members gathered at the training ground on the first floor of the mansion.

 <p>
  Me, Jenna, Velkist, Neryssa. The entire first party, except for Katiio, who was at the workshop.
 </p>
 <p>
  And a girl crouching in one of the corners.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was Kishasha.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Um… So.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After a round of explanations, Jenna opened her mouth with a bewildered expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her gaze was partly on Kishasha.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did she really ask to join our party?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “As you all know, Kishasha is the highest-ranked hero in the waiting room. I guarantee her abilities. She’s worth taking on. Wouldn’t it be a waste to let such talent go unused?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, when you said I should prepare for the selection match, you meant this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist smirked bitterly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Already in a battle stance, Velkist’s hand rested on his sheath.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So like last time, the winner takes the spot?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “For now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m ready. It will be different from before.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist glared at Kishasha.
 </p>
 <p>
  This guy was thoroughly defeated by Kishasha last time when I was in Niflheimr. Since then, he has been grinding his teeth and training hard.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s better this way. Saves the trouble of having to go find and stick to someone.”

 <p>
  Kishasha yawned with a lazy face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How interesting.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist’s mumbled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then I’ll be…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your turn comes much later.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I shook my head.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna stood next to me with a tense expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  She didn’t look like she was backing out, nor did it seem like she had any intention to, but it looked like she was preparing for something.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jenna first.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So I’m to fight first, huh?”
 </p>

 <p>
  “It will be a good experience for both of you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright. I’ll give it a try.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna, with her quiver and bow strapped to her back and a dagger sheath at her waist, stepped into the arena.
 </p>
 <p>
  As I gestured, Kishasha, who had been looking lazy, lit up her eyes and followed Jenna.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, I’m fighting that human girl?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your first opponent.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s a second then. Well, it doesn’t matter.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I glanced at Velkist and Neryssa.
 </p>
 <p>
  The reason for having Jenna spar, firstly, is to gather a wide range of combat data, secondly, to increase Jenna’s experience, and lastly, to offer a small advantage to these two.
 </p>
 <p>
  To give them a chance to observe the opponent.

 <p>
  ‘This should be fine.’
 </p>
 <p>
  At the very least, I’m offering a minimal merit.
 </p>
 <p>
  What comes after, they’ll have to handle on their own.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist, seated on a chair, watched Kishasha with blazing eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Always full of fighting spirit. Even if he falls this time, he’ll rise again soon. So, I can also make decisions without hesitation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘She seems a bit cooler.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa seemed to be thinking something else.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a face showing no interest, she alternately looked at Kishasha and Velkist.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Something changed in her.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Her attitude was different from before.
 </p>

 <p>
  At first, I thought she was similar to Velkist.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa suddenly looks a lot like me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our eyes met. She made an indescribable, peculiar expression, then turned her head away.
 </p>
 <p>
  The duel began.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna, as usual, retreated while unleashing a barrage of arrows.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moving nimbly to maintain distance, she dragged the battle into a mid-to-long-range fight. If the enemy managed to break through, she would confront them with a dagger, looking for an opening. This was Jenna’s most common tactic. However.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The outcome was decided in the blink of an eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having never fought anyone faster than herself, Jenna was caught by Kishasha’s dazzling speed. Kishasha easily deflected the arrows and dagger, then placed her claw at Jenna’s throat.

 <p>
  ‘About 20 seconds.’
 </p>
 <p>
  “I, I lost.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna raised her hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  “For a human, you’re fast. And skilled too. But don’t rely too much on your legs.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna nodded her head to Kishasha’s advice with an awkward face.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha’s advice was simple: change the battle pattern according to the opponent’s characteristics. In a speed battle, Jenna couldn’t win against Kishasha. If she had fought differently, she could have lasted at least twice as long.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, Oppa!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna, who was deep in thought while descending from the arena, called out.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can I try one more time?”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Go ahead. I’ve cleared the schedule for today anyway. It doesn’t matter.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m always ready.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha smirked.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna bowed to me and Kishasha before stepping back into the arena. Her expression was filled with determination.
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s plenty of time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since I cleared today’s schedule.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sis was incredibly fast.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Referring to someone visibly younger as “sister” must be due to her understanding of the different races. Kishasha simply lifted her claw without a word.
 </p>
 <p>
  30 minutes later.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I lost.”
 </p>

 <p>
  Jenna shook her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna’s final record was 6 losses out of 6 matches. In the last match, she managed to hold out for nearly 5 minutes, but still, she didn’t land a single effective hit.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re strong. I see potential in you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thanks for the compliment. When my secret technique is complete, let’s match again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Will do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna descended the stairs with a look of regret.
 </p>
 <p>
  Secret technique. That reminds me, she didn’t use the skill she acquired from skill synthesis last time.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seems incomplete.
 </p>
 <p>
  Next.
 </p>
 <p>
  My gaze shifted to Velkist.
 </p>
 <p>
  Naturally, his winning rate wasn’t high.
 </p>
 <p>
  At best, it was less than 10%. But it didn’t seem like he had any intention of backing down. On the contrary, he was even smirking while handling his sheath.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Am I next?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If I can’t beat that archer, I’ll be the target for this selection. The same goes for other roles. If I lose, I’ll leave the first party. Isn’t that right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t lie.
 </p>
 <p>
  I affirmed Velkist’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This brat is still monstrously strong. It’s like looking at the senior. But I haven’t been just playing around either. Let’s do this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist chuckled, drawing his sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  And just as he was about to step up the stairs.

 <p>
  A dispassionate voice shook the training ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned around. Neryssa had her hand raised.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What did you say?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist muttered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll step down from the first party.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You must be joking. Are you serious?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Serious.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa answered without hesitation.

  ‘Those guys…’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I had seen them before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And fought against them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The escort mission on the 15th floor, in the latter part, blocking the entrance, the black knights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dozens of black knights were blocking the retreat route, driving the troops into a corner. Their movements surpassed the human limit. As someone in the same position, I could tell. They were of our kind.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their number is about thirty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘Where did they come from?’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It seemed like they weren’t there when I first looked.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Those guys will be fun to fight.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Velkist smirked.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The black knight unit was blocking the troops’ retreat route and carrying out a one-sided slaughter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A few soldiers resisted but were soon trampled like ants and crumbled. The cult’s forces were pressing in from the front. The outcome was decided. It was a complete annihilation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘What are they trying to show us?’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I glanced at my wrist.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The flesh, translucent like jelly, allowed light to pass through. My body was gradually becoming faint.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A sign for our return. As Jenna said, once they were completely annihilated, we would be able to return to the waiting room.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Jenna, Kishasha!”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Yes?”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Yea.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Pay more attention to the battlefield. If you notice anything, let me know immediately. I have a bad feeling.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both nodded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘Strange.’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Call it a master’s instinct or whatever; even if it was a linked quest, there was no need to drag it out like this.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A foreboding feeling came over me.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I also diligently scanned the area, but the distance was quite far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While I could understand the overall flow, the details were not visible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even with the power of deep insight, this was as far as I could go. But Jenna and Kishasha would be different. I should be able to receive meaningful reports from them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Han.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When a general riding a white horse fell and the troops were reduced to a quarter, Kishasha spoke.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Did you find something?”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s that human female.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “What do you mean, human female?”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I found the female who bothered me. Asking to save humans and such. The human woman from that time is over there.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kishasha pointed to the lower right of the battlefield.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I followed the thin finger of Kishasha.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Where my gaze landed, there were dozens of black knights and…
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “…!”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When I came to my senses, I was running down the hill.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Where are you going?!”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Han, I said it was blocked!”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I can’t just watch!”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I shouted as if spitting out the words and increased my speed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  My hand was already on the sheath at my belt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘Why is she…?’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Questions followed one after another.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even as I pieced my thoughts together, my pace quickened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A full sprint.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gathering all the strength in my body, I dashed forward.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The wind whipped my face like a whip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘I can’t understand…’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When could I ever understand?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I gritted my teeth and ran.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The battlefield, which had seemed far away and like a scene from a movie, was enlarging before me.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sound of spears and swords, the thick scent of blood, the smell of flesh, the desperate screams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Within that…
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Pria”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I shouted at the top of my lungs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The next moment, my shoulder collided with the invisible wall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I swallowed the pain that felt like I was about to shatter and corrected my posture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Answer me! Priasis! Pria!”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  My voice seemed to be buried in the noise of the battlefield, and she did not turn to look at me.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Aaagh!”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Please, save me…”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I surrender, I surrender! Please…”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The soldiers nearby were killed off like straw.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Begging and pleading were useless. Resistance even more so. The black knights methodically reaped their lives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Within that encirclement, Priasis Al Ragnar stood with a stern expression.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her silken silver hair was dirtied with dust and blood, her pale face smeared with sweat and dirt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The formal armor she wore was dented all over. Holding a half-broken sword in her right hand, Pria shouted as if in a frenzy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Didn’t I say I surrender!”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “…”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I’ll give my life! So let these people go! Wasn’t it my life you wanted?”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The black knights did not answer at all.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hot blood splattered from a severed neck, soiling Pria’s slender neck.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Who exactly are you? Why are you tormenting me so much! I only… wanted to save the people…”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her golden eyes twisted, and her voice choked with sobs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Why…”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bang!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I kicked the wall with all my might.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the wall didn’t budge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘What is this?’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was incomprehensible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hey! Can you hear me?!”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “You bastards, who do you think I am! I won’t die easily!”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Finally, only Pria was left on the battlefield.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dozens of black knights surrounded her. Beyond them, hundreds of infantry were in the first line. Further beyond, the second line of infantry. And then the third.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “…”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pria bowed her head.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I am of the royal family… leading the people…”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  &lt;Kill her.&gt;
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Out from the black knights’ visors, a boiling voice leaked.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  &lt;Kill the witch.&gt;
  <br/>
  <br/>
  &lt;The filthy witch, kill her.&gt;
  <br/>
  <br/>
  &lt;Witch. Witch. Witch.&gt;
  <br/>
  <br/>
  &lt;Kill. It hurts. Kill her. It hurts.&gt;
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The thirty black knights spoke in unison.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As if in a choir.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “…”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I withdrew my hand from the sheath.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At most, the distance was 5m. But I couldn’t possibly overcome the wall that seemed like mere paper in front of me.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was no way, and I, being a former master, knew that best.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Tell me. Where did I go wrong.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  &lt;You defiled. Our pride.&gt;
  <br/>
  <br/>
  &lt;You sold out the world we loved.&gt;
  <br/>
  <br/>
  &lt;If only you weren’t there.&gt;
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What nonsense.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I frowned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Priasis screamed with bloodshot eyes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “What do you mean? What did I sell out! To whom exactly!”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The black knights did not answer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They only raised their swords, sticky with flesh, innards, and blood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I let out a bitter laugh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And quietly shouted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Brat.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Finally, Freya’s gaze shifted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It wasn’t a loud shout, but it caught her attention.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her golden eyes which were filled with despair and resignation lit up with a spark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “… Han.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I said nothing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After all, it was over. My body was enveloped in light.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘I have nothing to say.’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Not even a goodbye.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It would be awkward to tell her to rest well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I’m glad you’re alive.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pria smiled at me with tears in her eyes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And amidst countless slashes, Pria’s body was hacked to pieces and disappeared without a trace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Stage Clear!]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [‘Han (★★★)’, ‘Jenna (★★★)’, ‘Kishasha (★★★★)’, Level Up!]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Reward – 300,000G, Wraith Fragment (Low)]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [MVP – ‘Kishasha (★★★★)’]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Ding!]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Notification – You have 4 attempts left!]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I returned through the rift in space-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Except for Kishasha, everyone had a dazed expression.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even though the distance was far, they must have clearly seen Pria, who had been a key figure in the mission, die.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘…’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  4 attempts left.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a clear hint.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The last message gave me confidence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘Loop.’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I stepped out of the rift in space-time.

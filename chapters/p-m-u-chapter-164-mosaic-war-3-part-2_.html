  “Let’s start.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Yes! I’ll go first!”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jenna saluted me and then ran towards the northern hill.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her role was simple. To apprehend the mission’s time limit. That is, from start to finish, how long we can last. That’s why I gave her the pocket watch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘Precisely.’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The time limit must be measured down to the second.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also, she must record without omission the events happening on the battlefield during her observation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To use as milestones for measuring branching points. At least for this turn, Jenna won’t participate in the battle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘Next.’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Take care.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Leave it to me. We’re not called the Gale for nothing.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kishasha grinned, showing her fangs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She then dropped down and ran across the plains like a beast on a sprint.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She will perform reconnaissance by circling around the field in a counter-clockwise direction. Kishasha is also out for this round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  「…….」
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Katiio had his eyes closed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was holding a rainbow-colored stone in his hand, and blue magical waves were spreading from his entire body.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘He’s also….’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Useless.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was synchronizing the visions of Jenna and Kishasha.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The scenes seen by the two would be preserved as video data in the magic stone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Just the two of us left.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “That’s enough.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Of course.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Velkist silently smiled and drew his sword.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I smiled back and unbuckled my sheath. Ahead, a convoy of wagons loaded with supplies stretched out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hey, did you hear something strange just now?”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Strange sound, you say? I don’t know what you mean.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Like, you know, the rustling of a mouse…”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swoosh!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The necks of the two chatting soldiers were simultaneously severed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before the blood spurting from their necks could hit the ground, I twirled my sword and leaped to the front of the convoy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Who are you?!”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Velkist leaped gracefully, creating a hole in the chest of the leading soldier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The blood soared. There was no time to mingle with these guys.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I drew my sword and ran.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Ugh!”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Spare me… it’s a monster!”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “You brutes! I, Silver Paladin acting as the wrath of the goddess, Kyle von Strauss…!”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About ten minutes later,
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Numerous bodies were strewn across the ground.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After shaking off the sticky blood from my greatsword, I turned my back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blue potions leaked from beneath the shattered wagons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘If we deal with this supply route….’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The cult’s magical bombardments will stop.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In other words, it buys us time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hurry.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I know.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Without even catching our breath, we continued our run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To the next area. Over the hill, towards the west.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘There’s something prepared by Anytng.’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I snapped my fingers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Master, ‘Han(★★★)’ requests a mount summoning!]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Do you accept? Summoning requires a ‘Summoning Stone’.]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Yes(Select) / No]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Swipe the screen!]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Give wings to your hero, Master!]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Ding!]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [‘Gandalf(★)’ is summoned to the battlefield!]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [‘Saruman(★)’ is summoned to the battlefield!]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Flash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A summoning gate opened beside me, and two robust horses appeared on the plains.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A gray and a white horse. Prepared in advance by Anytng during my confrontation with the Union, these horses were captured from a weekday dungeon and trained in the stables.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Heeheeheeng!”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I mounted Gandalf.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With a kick, the horse neighed and began to gallop across the plains.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Velkist followed on Saruman, mounted behind me.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Velkist!”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “What?”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Split to the left. Check the boundary of the field!”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Got it. Be careful!”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Velkist turned the horse’s head.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shortly after, Velkist’s figure, along with the horse, faded into the distance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘The field is wider than I thought.’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It seemed right to summon horses just in case, but it looks like I made the right choice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I gripped the reins and kicked Gandalf’s flanks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Heeheeheeing!”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Riding the horse across the plains, I put my hand to my ear.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Katiio, how’s the communication line?”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  &lt;It’s done. I’ll relay it now!&gt;
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Connect me to Kishasha.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The left side of my vision blurred, and an image appeared.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kishasha running across the plains. But behind her, strange figures riding black horses were following.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Black Knight Lv.41] X 13
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I frowned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Black Knights. They were the ones who had broken into the rear of the army and wreaked havoc.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those guys were chasing Kishasha at a speed not inferior to hers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Kishasha.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  &lt;Han. These guys have a nasty smell.&gt;
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Where did they appear from?”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  &lt;There.&gt;
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kishasha gestured with her head towards the right.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On a red rocky hill, a black castle stood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘…That’s.’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A suspicious aura emanated from the entire castle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A peach-colored statue was glimpsed through the slightly open gate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was immediately recognizable. The mission’s most crucial object; the statue of the goddess.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  &lt;There’s not just one of those weird things. I passed by another one at the beginning.&gt;
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “At least two, then. Can you shake them off?”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  &lt;Of course!&gt;
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I removed my hand from my ear, and the image disappeared.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kishasha would handle the right side of the field. I needed to check the left.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gandalf carried me across the plains to the west.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before long, I found the second location.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Far away, hundreds of people were walking in groups. Heading towards the battlefield.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Activating my deep insight, I could make out their attire. They were wearing steel armor and carrying quivers of longbows.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘An archer unit.’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elite archers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eliminating them would delay the annihilation of the Lion Army even further.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mission’s scope was beginning to take shape.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘On the left, there are delay points, and on the right, there are fortresses containing objects.’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘Dual simultaneous assault.’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Considering the information gathered so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘…It’s the worst.’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It boasted the highest difficulty among Loops.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Time is limited, forces must be split without fail, there are multiple points to capture, and there are enemies chasing us.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘Is this also part of your plan?’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Did you increase the game’s difficulty to this absurd level just to mess with me?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It doesn’t matter. I shook my head.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No matter what mission comes, I’ll just break through and smash it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘You’ve messed with the wrong person.’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I tightened my grip on the reins.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gandalf galloped towards the archer unit, mane fluttering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, between the archer unit and me, an endless cliff lay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the cliff, a shoddy stone bridge crossed it. It was clearly an unnatural terrain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Don’t stop.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I kicked the horse once more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There’s no time to play. Cross the bridge in one go and head towards the archer unit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From the west to the north, run and join Kishasha. That was the ultimate goal of this second round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Crack!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Gandalf!”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Heeheeheehee!”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gandalf let out a pained cry and collapsed sideways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It happened while we were speeding at tens of kilometers per hour. I was flung from the saddle, flying through the air. I quickly regained my balance mid-air and landed, scraping the dirt ground.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [‘Gandalf(★)’ has been unsummoned!]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘What happened?’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Soon, I understood the cause.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I dusted off the dirt on my armor and looked across the stone bridge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the opposite side of the cliff, next to the stone bridge, stood someone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He wore a dark feathered hat and a black cloth with wide sleeves, his face was hidden behind a mask. The man lifted his longbow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Danger!]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [The Marksman of Death Lv.?]

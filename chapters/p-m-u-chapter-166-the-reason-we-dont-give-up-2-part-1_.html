  [Date: XX Month XX Day]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The document began with a date.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I continued to read the text below.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [I received a strange file from someone named Loki.]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [It’s filled with complicated words. I didn’t fully understand its meaning, but I read it through. It seems like the person who organized and analyzed the data must be remarkable.]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Wouldn’t it be better to use such skills outside of gaming?]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Anyway, I decided to keep a record of my own gameplay as well. It seems fun.]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This is…”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [“It seems like he kept a diary of his gameplay.”]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I let out a dry laugh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Someone still writes these kinds of things in this day and age.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And on a phone, no less.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘It’s said that he received a strange file.’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ‘diary’ seems to have started from when I had sent the strategy document.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Date: XX Month XX Day]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Cleared level 15. Han almost died.]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [It was because of Aaron. It got messed up because Han tried to save that guy.]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [That guy tries hard, but his skills don’t improve.]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Useless fellow.]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘…This.’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I felt sorry for Aaron.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Date: XX Month XX Day]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Cleared level 20. Han took down a dragon by himself.]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [I heard that 1-star born heroes are weak? Maybe the strategy is weird.]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Anyway, it seems like he did well, so I gave him a warrior statue. Han was also happy.]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘…’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Date: XX Month XX Day]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Han was dispatched to Niflheimr.]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [I looked into Loki, and he seems to be a more incredible gamer than I thought.]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [But no matter how much I think about it, I can’t understand why he’s interested in me. Why? Although I’m grateful for the help, I think I’m starting to enjoy it, even though I thought about quitting.]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The diary was written in quite some detail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Including the expansion of facilities and the history of hero summoning. Most of it matched my memories. It means that nothing was omitted. Surprisingly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Date: XX Month XX Day]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [My mom nagged me to stop playing games.]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Date: XX Month XX Day]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Cleared level 25.]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Kishasha is also useful. It was good to invest in her. Though it looks like I’ll be eating ramen for a while.]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most of the content could be skipped, but the impression of Pick Me Up! from Anytng seemed quite valuable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It became easier to understand his playing style going forward.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While reading the diary, I stopped at one part.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Level 35. The tone changed from there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Date: XX Month XX Day]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Level 35, a member of party 1, Eolka, died.]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [I thought Han was going to die in the last dungeon.]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Glad he’s alive. But he seems sad that a colleague died. I gave him a warrior statue to comfort him.]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘…’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Even though it’s AI, it feels strange.]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Could such sophisticated artificial intelligence exist?]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [It feels almost like it’s alive.]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [I told a coworker, and he mocked me a lot, asking if I was out of my mind. He also recommended quitting, calling me a game addict. I don’t really want to quit.]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Have I gone crazy?]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Someway, I feel close to the heroes.]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I looked over at Iselle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She seemed to be reading the same part, sighing deeply with a complex expression.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘Could it be, he’s suspecting?’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I hadn’t imagined it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Just an ordinary gamer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I shook my head absentmindedly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  You may be impressed by its realism, but you won’t believe it’s real.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I think it’s just a momentary feeling. After that, the usual content continued.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Date: XX Month XX Day]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [This doesn’t seem right.]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Date: XX Month XX Day]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Han thrashed me in a mock battle.]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘…’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Review of the strategy video for the 5th floor]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [05:35 – Han gathers members for a meeting. Afterwards, the formation is set. Barricades are built, and they start defending against goblins from three directions.]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [06:43 – Battle starts.]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [08:29 – Why split the members into three directions? Jenna at the intersection in the middle…]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I narrowed my eyes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It seemed to have been written relatively recently.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anytng was reviewing the strategy video for the 5th floor, analyzing why I distributed the party like that, how the battle was conducted, and how it was cleared.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Not just the 5th floor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The strategy review was thoroughly written up to level 35.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of course, the analysis wasn’t perfect, just a rough guess…
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [I don’t want to just wing it like I usually do.]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [This time, Han might die.]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This kind of determination is hard to find in just a normal gamer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Who is this user, Loki?]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [The more I see, the more remarkable he is. The answers to the doubts I had while operating the waiting room are detailed here. It’s admirable that someone can invest so much passion in a game.]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [If Loki had been the master here… Han wouldn’t have had to suffer alone.]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That’s funny.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To others, I’m just a gaming addict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Can I become like this too?]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘A total addict.’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I couldn’t help but laugh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The diary also recorded daily life incidents while being hooked on Pick Me Up!.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Getting caught using the phone during work hours or hitting a pole while walking. And being nagged daily by parents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘But still.’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [I don’t want to quit.]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I closed the folder.

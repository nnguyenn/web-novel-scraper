  “You! I, the Silver Paladin, Kyle von Strauss, acting as the wrath of the goddess…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Enough already.

  I instantly cut off the neck of the one making a fuss.
 </p>
 <p>
  After quickly dealing with a few key knights…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Velkist, you can handle it alone, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good luck!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The key to this mission was how much we could shorten the time.
 </p>
 <p>
  We couldn’t afford any time wasting. We needed to achieve maximum efficiency with minimal manpower.
 </p>
 <p>
  After leaving Velkist alone, we ran again.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Slide the screen!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Please put wings on the master’s hero!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ding!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Gandalf (★)’ is summoned to the battlefield!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Radagast (★)’ is summoned to the battlefield!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng called for a mount.
 </p>
 <p>
  I jumped onto the horse running next to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna quickly climbed onto the horse and pulled Katiio up behind her.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The second section.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the place where we failed during the second loop.

 <p>
  The cliffs where the archer appeared, blocking access with all sorts of bizarre archery.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ready?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I firmly gripped the reins.
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio nodded silently.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t hesitate for even a second. We’re going right away.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oppa, I trust you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just do well, that’s all.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio pulled a magic stone from his pocket and handed it to Jenna.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna attached the magic stone to an arrowhead and immediately strung it on her longbow. Even while riding, her shooting stance was steady. Jenna’s arrow was already aimed at the cliff on the other side.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Danger!]

  [The Marksman of Death Lv.?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Across the stone bridge.
 </p>
 <p>
  The archer, who had been sitting leisurely, stood up.
 </p>
 <p>
  His dark bow gleamed with a black light.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thump.
 </p>
 <p>
  A light sound.
 </p>
 <p>
  I instantly drew Bifrost and swung it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  The joint in my right arm creaked.

 <p>
  The first shot had come from behind.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Troublesome bastard.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Initially, I couldn’t see the arrow he had shot properly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The direction was random. Although he shot from the front, it appeared from the side or behind. The direction would change abruptly, or sometimes it would suddenly shoot up from the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can handle up to five shots.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As the shooting continued, its power increased, and strange effects were mixed in.
 </p>
 <p>
  The archer was about 50 meters away on the other side of the cliff. His second shot followed. I knew this pattern too. I let go of the reins and drew my dagger.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang!
 </p>
 <p>
  Above my head.
 </p>
 <p>
  Below my left rib.

 <p>
  The distance was now about 30 meters.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at Jenna. She was riding, pulling the bowstring, and staring at the other side of the cliff.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Arrows won’t work on him.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna tried to restrain him with arrows, but they didn’t work at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  We had tried magic defense, but it was easily penetrated. We all knew it from experience.
 </p>
 <p>
  So,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s go!”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a lively command, Jenna released the bowstring.
 </p>
 <p>
  The arrow shot out from the longbow at a ferocious speed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The archer had released his third shot just then.

 <p>
  [‘Gandalf (★)’ is unsummoned!]
 </p>
 <p>
  A hole appeared in the horse’s forehead.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Jenna’s arrow crossed paths, it embedded itself in the lower part of the cliff where the sniper was standing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Connect!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio shouted with a voice filled with magical power.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before the horse fell down with a scream and my body hit to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There’s only one chance.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I tightened my grip on the sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  A tingling sensation wrapped around my entire body.

 </p>
 <p>
  The scenery changed in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  Below was endless darkness. Above was the blue sky and the archer looking down at me in surprise. He was flustered but preparing to shoot.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you think it’ll work?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I kicked off the ground and rushed up to him.
 </p>
 <p>
  I headbutted him right in the face as he was about to pull the bowstring.
 </p>
 <p>
  He staggered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!

 <p>
  I tripped him and then kicked him hard.
 </p>
 <p>
  He fluttered down the cliff in his flapping coat.
 </p>
 <p>
  The end. I brought my hand to my ear and spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Velkist, are you done?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;I’ve finished here. I’m on my way now.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Same here. Join up with the other two and handle the archer unit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Will do.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna’s horse was crossing the stone bridge.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I signaled with my eyes, Katiio formed another hand sign.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…We can’t use the normal way.’
 </p>
 <p>
  There isn’t enough time.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how we planned the route, we couldn’t meet the clear time.
 </p>
 <p>
  If that’s the case, we had to use an anomaly.
 </p>
 <p>
  A Wizard is weaker than an Elementalist in a head-on battle, but they enable a clear in another way.
 </p>
 <p>
  Space compression using teleportation magic. This allowed us to overcome the limits of distance without forcibly dividing our power.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Connect!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio cast the second teleportation.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I came to my senses.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Have you arrived?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  I was on Kishasha’s back.

  ‘Next.’
 </p>
 <p>
  There are three fortresses in the eastern field.
 </p>
 <p>
  The final goal is to capture all the fortresses…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But there’s a priority.’
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s an object in one of the fortresses that can summon the rearguard.
 </p>
 <p>
  For a quick clear, it’s natural to summon the rearguard first.
 </p>
 <p>
  The problem is that the object appears randomly in one of the three fortresses.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, I don’t know the right answer.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ding!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Opening the tactical tab!]

 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng selected a command tool and drew on the screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Zing!
 </p>
 <p>
  A red arrow appeared in the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  The arrow pointed northeast.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha changed direction and ran across the meadow.
 </p>
 <p>
  Twice the speed of a horse. The fortress landscape quickly approached.
 </p>
 <p>
  A black fortress wall several meters high appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Cult Archers Lv.36] x 15
 </p>
 <p>
  Pipipipip!
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha zigzagged through the volley of arrows and approached the fortress wall, then jumped vertically.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Rawr!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the archers caught in Kishasha’s fangs turned into shreds.
 </p>
 <p>
  After landing on the fortress wall, Kishasha swung its front paws, tearing apart three more before leaping into the fortress. A white marble statue of a goddess was emitting a blue light.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Danger!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [High-ranking Inquisitor]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Mighty Rodvik Lv.46]
 </p>
 <p>
  He appeared as expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  In front of the goddess statue, a giant nearly 3 meters tall in iron armor held a mace.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sinister voice flowed from the devil-masked helmet.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Death… to the heretics…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  He raised his pillar-like mace.
 </p>
 <p>
  We had wasted a lot of time here during the third loop.
 </p>
 <p>
  I smirked and held my sword horizontally.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Ascend.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han(★★★)’ enters Ascend state!]
 </p>
 <p>
  I collided my sword with the mace he was trying to bring down on my head.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack!
 </p>
 <p>
  With a blast, the mace-wielding giant’s right hand was blown off.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uooooo!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha smashed the giant’s chest with its front paw.
 </p>
 <p>
  The iron plate crumpled, and the giant’s huge body fell to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Die.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I thrust my sword into the slit of his helmet.

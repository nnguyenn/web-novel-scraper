  I cooled my head, which felt as though it were burning.

 <p>
  “……Phew.”
 </p>
 <p>
  My whole body creaked.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was just from a slight activation.
 </p>
 <p>
  But it was much better than the first time. I drank a stamina potion and looked around. Troops were gathering inside the fortress.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kishasha.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Crunch!
 </p>
 <p>
  The statue of the goddess shattered under her fierce forepaws.
 </p>
 <p>
  A bright blue light scattered, shooting into the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Object effect activated!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, reinforcements can now be deployed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Reach out with a helping hand to the hero in peril!]
 </p>
 <p>
  A good start.
 </p>
 <p>
  Things were going as planned.
 </p>
 <p>
  After tossing away the empty potion bottle, I climbed onto Kishasha’s back.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Selecting reinforcements.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Designated parties – ‘Party 2’, ‘Party 3’, ‘Party 4’, ‘Party 5’]
 </p>
 <p>
  A summoning message appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  By now, freshly summoned heroes would be clustering at the starting area of the field.

 <p>
  As Kishasha scaled the walls of the fortress, I put my hand to my ear.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Edis, it’s me. Can you hear me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Yes, I hear you.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s no time. Move out with your members immediately. Master will tell you where to go. You’ve seen it before, so you know the drill.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;I know. Just follow the arrows, right?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Take command of the details. And as I said, quickly leave anyone who looks like they can’t keep up. We don’t have time to spare. Make sure to bring the twin mages.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Got it.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m counting on you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I ended the communication.
 </p>
 <p>
  The role of Edis’s party was clear.

  If we were the special forces moving across the entire field dealing with major obstacles and named monsters, they were the infantry troops directly planting flags in enemy territory.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Next?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha growled as we escaped the fortress.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Two left. Down we go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Each fortress had its named monster.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each had distinct characteristics. The first was brute strength. The others specialized in speed and skill.
 </p>
 <p>
  All three were rather troublesome if confronted head-on.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Black Knight Lv.41] x 5
 </p>
 <p>
  Behind the fortress, the gate opened and knights riding black horses charged out.
 </p>
 <p>
  A pursuit squad to chase us. This was also within expectations. If we drew the attention here, it would make the assault team’s occupation easier.

 </p>
 <p>
  The assault team would take directions from Anytng to circle right and occupy the fortress.
 </p>
 <p>
  I raced south with Kishasha. We had to clear the obstacles before they reached the first fortress.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s been 32 minutes and 33 seconds.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The second hand of my pocket watch was ticking.
 </p>
 <p>
  We had about 2 hours and 30 minutes left.

 <p>
  In front of the second fortress’s object.
 </p>
 <p>
  The black knight twirled his twin swords extravagantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  With incredible speed, he moved in a way that dazzled the eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……Hehe.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The knight gave a smug laugh, then vanished from sight.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’m familiar with this pattern.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled in response.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ve fought too many faster opponents to count.
 </p>
 <p>
  From Ridigion to Kishasha.
 </p>
 <p>
  I suddenly reached out with my left hand.

 <p>
  “Ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  My claw-like left hand gripped his neck.
 </p>
 <p>
  As I lifted my hand, his body dangled loosely.
 </p>
 <p>
  Squeezing the grip, I felt his neck bone snap along with his body stretching out.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Weak after all.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I threw the corpse aside and faced forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Order of the Cult Soldiers Lv.26] x 157
 </p>
 <p>
  Numerous soldiers were swarming in front of the statue of the goddess.
 </p>
 <p>
  We could break through and destroy the statue now, but it wasn’t yet the right time.
 </p>
 <p>
  The annoyance was dealt with. The rest could be left to Edis’s party.

 </p>
 <p>
  I glanced at the soldiers and then rode Kishasha out of the fortress.
 </p>
 <p>
  The black knights relentlessly pursued us.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Katlio, can you hear me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;I can.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve dealt with the second one. It’s your turn.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Wait a moment.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Seconds later, light began to envelop my body.
 </p>
 <p>
  A signal for spatial displacement. I lightly stroked Kishasha’s mane.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m off. See you later.”

 <p>
  &lt;Okay.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I opened my eyes again, I saw numerous corpses strewn across the plains.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sickly smell of blood from the archers who had tried to join the battlefield tickled my nose. Velkist, who had been sitting on a rock, got up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ve arrived. We were just about to set off.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katlio gulped down a magic potion, gasping for breath.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna was nowhere to be seen. She must be dealing with the third named monster with Kishasha. The matchup was more in her favor than mine.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The state of the battlefield…’
 </p>
 <p>
  I glanced to the side.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Cult’s forces were devouring the Lion’s troops in an encirclement.
 </p>
 <p>
  A fierce blaze erupted on the right side of the Lion’s troops. It had been about 73 minutes.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Lion’s troops were about halfway to annihilation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katlio stood up, fatigue evident on his face from overusing teleportation magic.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just hang in there a bit longer. It’s almost over.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I patted Katlio’s shoulder.
 </p>
 <p>
  Katlio gave a wry smile and mounted his horse.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The last one.’
 </p>
 <p>
  There is a river crossing the plains to the north, a landscape as awkward as a cliff in its unnatural placement.
 </p>
 <p>
  And beyond that…

  [Black Maelstrom Mage Lv.?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The mage that had thwarted me in my third attempt was waiting there.
 </p>
 <p>
  Wrapped up like a mummy, the mage barely moved his lips.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;La Bru Seum.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Rumble!
 </p>
 <p>
  A sound of thunder followed, and the river’s flow intensified.
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly swollen, the river currents spiraled into a raging torrent.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a kind of barrier. It’s like saying, you shall not pass this point.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Quite troublesome.’

 <p>
  Dozens of black knights passed by me, swinging their weapons.
 </p>
 <p>
  Greatswords plunged down, maces rushed forward, and spears were thrown. I firmly stood my ground and parried every attack. Although the area was chaotic with dust and clashing sounds, it was not a significant hindrance to me now. If anyone showed even a slight opening,

 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  One knight’s head soared into the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  Following the path of the severed head, black blood scattered.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Han! Looks like the way is open. We’ll join up first!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis and about twenty other heroes advanced to join the defensive line.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, they couldn’t play a decisive role. At best, they could only delay defeat.
 </p>
 <p>
  Right now, the true agents of change in this battle were none other than us.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whatever the method, it had to be done. Otherwise, we’d all die.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among these methods…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It has to be me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I blocked the enemy’s attacks and occasionally counterattacked, pondering over the situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  A way for a few to influence the outcome of the battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This should do it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Surprisingly, the method was simple.
 </p>
 <p>
  As three black knights simultaneously thrust their spears and swords,
 </p>
 <p>
  I rolled on the ground to dodge and shouted to the members fighting nearby.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Move! We need to change the battleground!”

 <p>
  “Where to?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can’t you see? Just guess!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I got up and immediately ran.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the end of a steep downhill slope was the rear of the battlefield. There, mages from the Cult army were gathered in small groups, preparing for the next magical barrage.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I see. Fight in enemy territory.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Obviously.”
 </p>
 <p>
  We all had experience in chaotic fights.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, it would be more dangerous, but to sow confusion, we had no choice but to fight right in the midst of the enemy. I tensed my leg muscles and pushed off the ground. My body slid down the slope like an arrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oppa!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna, riding Kishasha, reached out her hand.

 <p>
  I grabbed her hand and with agile movements, mounted the tiger’s back.
 </p>
 <p>
  Black knights furiously chased us from behind.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Velkist, handle the mages! Just make sure they can’t cast their magic.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Will do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist raised his blood-soaked sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  We broke through the middle of the downhill slope. Normally, we would be blocked by an invisible wall here, but now the path was clear. I calmed my frantic breath. This brawl was just a warm-up. The real fight was still ahead.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What, what!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A mage at the very back locked eyes with me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ping! Jenna quickly silenced him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘As quickly as possible.’

 <p>
  Even now, the cult army was continuously charging the lion soldiers at the front.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Haah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Jenna took a short breath, a hint of red light flickered in her eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Three arrows were notched on the bowstring of her short bow and fired in different directions, piercing three mages. The mages who sensed the ambush too late shouted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Rear! Watch the rear! It’s an enemy attack!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are the guards doing!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Heavily armored infantry stepped forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed they were specially assigned as guards for the mage unit.
 </p>
 <p>
  With their shields raised, the mages started casting towards us.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!

 <p>
  An arrow from Jenna’s short bow unexpectedly curved like a snake, passing through the gaps in the shield wall. A mage continuing his chant got his head pierced.
 </p>
 <p>
  A combined skill, Sidewinder.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was an advanced archery skill that curved the trajectory of the shots.
 </p>
 <p>
  The formation of shield bearers faltered.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Jenna continued shooting, I stroked Kishasha’s mane.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Break through them in one go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Alright! I’ll speed up!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  I loosely held the hilt of my sword with my right hand, then gathered strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stay calm! Focus on the enemy…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Raaaaah!”

 <p>
  Kishasha leaped over the shield wall, biting off the head of an officer.
 </p>
 <p>
  Simultaneously, I swung my greatsword. The soldiers caught in its path were swept away like toys in the tide.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll take care of the mages!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Screech!
 </p>
 <p>
  With every pull of Jenna’s bowstring, another mage fell.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her skill was frightening. Even with shield bearers in front and hiding behind the terrain, her arrows unfailingly curved and cut off their air supply.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This isn’t enough.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The mage troop was only a part of the cult army.
 </p>
 <p>
  With an emotionless expression, I bisected a fleeing mage.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who are you! Where did you come from? There was nothing on the scouts… Gah!”

 <p>
  An officer in splendid armor clutched his throat and fell.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist passed by him, retrieving a dagger from the officer’s neck.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Go ahead. I’ll take care of this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t die.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Does it look like I will?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist grinned wickedly and lifted his sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Where to go?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “To the place where the commander is.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If we could slaughter all the high-ranking commanders, it would greatly disrupt the enemy’s morale and command.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha turned her head and charged forward again. Behind us, Velkist was engaged in a sword fight with a black knight.

  “Jenna, if you see any of the high-ranking ones, kill them all.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just target the ones in sparkling armor, right? Leave it to me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is this… Argh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A supply officer leading his group was hit by an arrow and collapsed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The soldiers’ eyes widened with panic. No wonder, since two people riding a giant tiger were wreaking havoc in their rear.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ignore them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Understood.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The small fries weren’t worth our attention.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our target was the three-story tent beyond the hill.
 </p>
 <p>
  Many flags fluttered there.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was clearly the command center.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The problem is, even if we deal with this, can we win?’
 </p>
 <p>
  We’ll strike first and think later.
 </p>
 <p>
  We sped past a unit preparing for a cavalry charge, creating chaos in our wake.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like the enemy’s counterattack was beginning. Archers had appeared on the distant high ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Fire!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Nearly a hundred archers simultaneously released their longbows.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Kishasha faltered, Jenna shouted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You don’t need to dodge! Keep going!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna’s hands moved at a blinding speed with her short bow.
 </p>

 <p>
  The direction was upward. The arrows flying towards us were smashed to pieces by Jenna’s arrows.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is that?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  An officer was momentarily dumbfounded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shooting down incoming arrows mid-flight was beyond human skill.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘She’s a monster.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, if she wasn’t, we wouldn’t stand a chance.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Screaaak!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Kishasha approached, the archers scattered like ants.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how much the commander tried to hold them back, it was futile. He too fell victim to Jenna’s shooting.
 </p>
 <p>
  The path to the command post.

 </p>
 <p>
  It was swarming.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hundreds of troops were gathered.
 </p>
 <p>
  A defensive line meant to prevent the command post from falling.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Edis, how’s it going?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;It seems the formation hasn’t collapsed yet. We’re somehow holding on.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Have you contacted the captain?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;He thanked us for the help. He said they’re regrouping and planning to retreat.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “No retreat. Tell them to fight.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After a brief pause, Edis spoke again.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;He said not to spout nonsense.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “There are mages there, right? Connect me directly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I called Katiio, who was resting and asked for a connection to the captain.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shortly after, a stranger’s voice was heard.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;I don’t know who you are, but thanks for the help. I am from the house of Assinis…&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Cut the greetings. We don’t have time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Running away is not allowed. You must win.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;I appreciate the help. But this is different. Forgive me but this is ridiculous talk! There’s a limit to recklessness!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll kill all the big heads for you. That should solve it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;What?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  I cut off the communication.

  “I’ll kill all the big heads for you. That should solve it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;What?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  I cut off the communication.
 </p>
 <p>
  What an individual must do to defeat an army.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s not complicated. Just cut off the main head.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, carrying it out was not without problems.

  ‘How many are there?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The troops in front of the command post kept increasing.
 </p>
 <p>
  They swelled endlessly, blocking the way. If it were just soldiers, it would be fortunate. Several layers of fences and high barricades obstructed the path.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can we break through? Even for Kishasha, breaking through there might be…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna’s voice was tinged with anxiety.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a valid point. Kishasha, in tiger form, surpassed any ordinary warhorse in all aspects. However, she couldn’t make the impossible possible. Biological limits do exist.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was just the three of us.
 </p>
 <p>
  And they were roughly five hundred strong.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it was merely about breaking through, perhaps it might be feasible, but the leaders inside the command post needed to be dealt with afterward. Carefully selected elites were spread out all around.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…However.’

  [High Command War…]
 </p>
 <p>
  A series of warnings and designated enemy markers popped up.
 </p>
 <p>
  I quickly scanned the list.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seventeen in total. Their levels ranged from the early to late forties.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking at their levels, they were obviously highly capable fighters.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Oppa.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha didn’t stop moving.

  While dodging a barrage of arrows, spears, and swords, she continued to charge.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just one shot.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The command post was about 20 meters away.
 </p>
 <p>
  By now, the space was so crowded with soldiers that there was no room to step.
 </p>
 <p>
  They blocked our way with spears and swords, or just with their bodies.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha’s speed gradually slowed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Can’t we break through?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Shield bearers lined up in the first row, spearmen in the second, and long swordsmen in the third.
 </p>
 <p>
  Between the shining square shields, spears protruded. Kishasha tried to find a gap in the formation, but it was impossible to dodge all the incoming attacks.

  A blind spear tore through Kishasha’s hide and flesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Attacks also started to pour onto us from above.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Are we surrounded?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The rear was already blocked.
 </p>
 <p>
  When all paths seemed closed, Kishasha stopped.

  I smirked slightly.

  I looked up at the hill.

  My eyes met with a middle-aged knight who was watching me with a chilling gaze.

 <p>
  There would be temporary chaos.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was the supreme commander, after all. But that would be it. Soon, the command structure would be restored.
 </p>
 <p>
  Others were ready to take his place. A brief disturbance would be just that, not enough to change the overall situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Huff.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I exhaled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Raaaaah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The next moment, Kishasha roared louder than any of the frontline soldiers could bear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Stretching her body, she leaped high into the air, her massive body achieving several meters of height.
 </p>

 <p>
  Kishasha picked me up and threw me forward while in midair.
 </p>
 <p>
  Beyond, toward the command post. Hundreds of soldiers and barricades instantly distanced themselves.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This isn’t enough.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The distance wasn’t enough.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just a bit more.
 </p>
 <p>
  Go!
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna, beside me, extended her interlocked hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  I balanced myself and then kicked off Jenna’s hands for an additional boost.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Jenna(★★★)’ has entered a bleeding state. Her health will decrease over time.]
 </p>
 <p>
  An arrow grazed Jenna’s forearm as it flew past.
 </p>
 <p>
  She took a hit meant for me. I didn’t look back at Jenna as she fell, but instead, I turned my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  The leap was about 10 meters high. I kicked off a high earthen barrier and propelled myself further, landing right in front of the command post.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Definitely.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Killing one man wasn’t the end.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if one head was cut off, there were plenty ready to replace it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Like a Hydra.
 </p>
 <p>
  Therefore.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There’s no choice but to kill them all.’

  A crunch.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sound of my bones shattering echoed, accompanied by immense pain shaking my brain.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘All the hell I’ve gone through.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I had used and released the Ascend skill hundreds of times.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was unbearable, but I gritted my teeth and endured through it. All the hardships with Jenna, the bone-grinding training, it was all for this moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  I landed in the middle of a clearing filled with seventeen Named enemies.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the same time, various weapons targeted me. Each one aimed at a vital spot.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Too late.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I grinned wickedly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang! I stomped the ground with full force.

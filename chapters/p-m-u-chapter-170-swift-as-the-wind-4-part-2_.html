 <p>
  I stood shoulder to shoulder with the two, silently gripping my dagger.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just before colliding with the front line of soldiers.

 <p>
  [Ding!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Allied NPC ‘Radasteri Knights’ joins the fray!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Advance everyone! Protect the heroes!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A group emerged from behind the hill and joined our ranks.
 </p>
 <p>
  Without a moment to exchange words, they positioned themselves in front of us and began fighting the soldiers.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna blinked, gripping her bow tightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Han, are you safe!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A familiar voice called out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Turning around, as expected, there she was.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I came running as soon as I saw you. Fortunately, I arrived just in time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria wiped the beads of sweat on her forehead and walked toward us.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t a short distance. She seemed to have run at full speed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, the ten knights who had joined the ranks were fighting the soldiers in line.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the questioning look on my face, Pria smiled awkwardly and opened his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “These are the escort troops provided by the House of Assinis. They readily accepted my request to help you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I am Adel Radasteri.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The man who appeared to be the captain bowed to me.
 </p>

 <p>
  Blood dripped from the tip of his sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Go ahead. We’ll hold them off. The escape route has been secured.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna and Kishasha looked at me simultaneously.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, there’s no need to refuse when offered help like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  We followed Pria down a path behind the hill. It seemed they had cleared the way earlier, as numerous bodies of Cult soldiers were strewn about.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We have much to talk about. But I think now is not the time. I’ll hold my words.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria muttered as we hastened our steps.
 </p>
 <p>
  I agreed. In the midst of a battlefield where blood and flesh were exchanged, it wasn’t the place for idle chat.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, it seems my role is done.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if I turned back and joined the fight, I couldn’t fulfill my part as a hero.

 <p>
  I looked healthier than anyone else, but my muscles and skeleton were thoroughly shattered. I knew my condition better than anyone else. Right now, I couldn’t fight.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Han! We’re pushing them back!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis’ voice reached me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her usually calm tone was vibrant.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed she was having a blast on the front lines.
 </p>
 <p>
  [We’ve defeated the enemy commander!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s great. Good job.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hehe, we’ll keep going.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng wasn’t just watching.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was actively using tactical tools, directing strike teams to crucial battlefields and locations with enemy high-ranking officers. Anytng’s focus was not on me but on Edis’ First Assault Squad.
 </p>

 <p>
  I then looked to the right of the battlefield.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Breakthrough! Show the might of the Empire’s strongest, the Assinis Knights!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Knights in heavy plate armor, along with their warhorses, were trampling through the enemy lines.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Cult knights followed, they were effortlessly pushed back. The Lion Army had its advantages, one being the strength of their knightly order.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘In the end.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Lion Army’s knightly order was rampant on the right.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the left, Edis’ Assault Squad was unleashing havoc.
 </p>
 <p>
  Both wings of the Cult Army were crushed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering the number and quality of the troops, the Cult Army had plenty of room to counterattack.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, that’s a story for when there are talented individuals to soothe and reorganize the army. With the senior command entirely destroyed, the Cult Army was fighting scattered and disorganized. Already, there were troops fleeing from the rear. They were running away.

 <p>
  ‘Luck… was on our side.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If we had entered the battlefield even a little later, a comeback would have been impossible due to the lack of troops.
 </p>
 <p>
  And more.
 </p>
 <p>
  If there hadn’t been a dark mage in the party if Anytng had not performed his role, if by chance the enemy’s leaders hadn’t been gathered together…
 </p>
 <p>
  If any one of these conditions hadn’t been met, the mission would have flowed in a completely different direction.
 </p>
 <p>
  The difficulty was that high.
 </p>
 <p>
  It made me suffer countless frustrations, even more so than Niflheimr had been.
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t have done it alone.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m glad I could help. Otherwise, I might have lived with guilt forever.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What guilt?”
 </p>

 <p>
  “If I couldn’t help my savior, what else would that be but a sin?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria turned to me with a smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I thought they only existed in books. To think they were real. True heroes. A few can indeed overturn fate. Truly, it’s like being an emissary of the gods…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You don’t have to say that. It’s cringe.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is, is that so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  We had reached the middle of the battlefield.
 </p>
 <p>
  The vast plain was littered with numerous corpses.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sat down on a suitable rock.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ve won! We’ve really won!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Those bastards! Kill them all!”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Raaaaaah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Morale soared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Troops of the Lion Army grouped together and charged.
 </p>
 <p>
  The outcome of the battle was decided. It could not be reversed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It looks like this is the end.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna raised her arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her small forearm was becoming blurry.
 </p>
 <p>
  A sign of mission clearance and a signal for returning to the lobby.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you going back there again?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priya murmured.

 <p>
  “Probably. We’ll come back soon. We can talk then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  There were many questions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Where is this place? Who are these people? Why are they fighting?
 </p>
 <p>
  We decided to set those questions aside for now.
 </p>
 <p>
  “See you later.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In the next mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was just the beginning.
 </p>
 <p>
  I closed my eyes.

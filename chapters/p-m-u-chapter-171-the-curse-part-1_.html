 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Each time I rushed through the trees, the sharp wind slapped against my cheeks.
 </p>

 <p>
  My breath formed white clouds as I exhaled. The forest was lush with greenery, yet the chill was believable enough for winter.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oppa, to the left!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna, who had been running atop the branches, shouted from above.
 </p>
 <p>
  As I turned left, a shadow darted away through the bushes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll block them from the front!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna leaped like a flying squirrel and landed on the branches of the opposite tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then she disappeared. Her agility in moving through the trees was enough to rival that of a monkey.
 </p>
 <p>
  I shook my head and jumped over a root protruding from the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  Why we were enduring this hardship was clear:
 </p>
 <p>
  [Floor 41.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Mission Type – Pursuit]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Objective – Chase and annihilate the remnants!]
 </p>
 <p>
  A mission window on the right side of my vision flickered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Floor 41 was an extension of Floor 40. The goal was to pursue and annihilate the remnants of a previous battle. This forest was connected to the plains of Floor 40.
 </p>
 <p>
  Normally, we would have rested.
 </p>
 <p>
  As we did after every boss stage.
 </p>
 <p>
  But this time, we didn’t rest.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had insisted to Anytng to challenge Floor 41 immediately. The first reason was curiosity about what lay beyond Floor 40, and the second was because a 4-star promotion was imminent.

 <p>
  Just one level up to 40.
 </p>
 <p>
  My experience bar was nearly full.
 </p>
 <p>
  Completing this mission would satisfy the conditions for my promotion to 4-stars.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s better to finish up and then rest, rather than stop at an awkward point.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I thought it was a breather mission…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Personally, I wanted to discuss with Pria and learn about the backstory of Floor 40.
 </p>
 <p>
  But here we were, dropped into this location with a mission to annihilate the remnants. Probably after this mission, I’d have a chance to speak privately with her. I decided to resolve all the accumulated questions then.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It won’t take long.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The bushes were stained red here and there.
 </p>
 <p>
  Signs of bleeding. The wounds weren’t shallow. There was no need to hurry; the target wouldn’t last long. I followed the trail with a dagger in my left hand, held in reverse grip.
 </p>

 <p>
  Technically, it was a breather mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  The target had been severely injured even before encountering us.
 </p>
 <p>
  Chasing a half-dead man to finish him off.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna was quickly making her way through the forest to the right.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist and Kishasha were circling the outskirts of the forest, blocking the exit. Katiio had also spread out search magic just in case. There was nowhere for the target to escape.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How about it, do you think you can catch them?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria’s voice echoed in my ears.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed that they were using communication magic at the other camp.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course. They won’t escape.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is it possible… to capture them alive?”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Why?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The one you are chasing is the only surviving officer from the Cult’s army. We want to extract information through interrogation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  They want to interrogate them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Does that mean even Pria doesn’t know the full story?
 </p>
 <p>
  “As you might expect, I came here with the support of the Assinis family to find the last key. Then the Cult’s army showed up. It’s as if they knew.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I am curious. I wonder why they call me a witch, why they hate me and try to stop me so vehemently. I want to know. I’m sorry to ask, but… could you do it, Han?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll try, but I can’t promise anything.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I ended the communication.

 <p>
  Capture alive? That wasn’t mentioned in the mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, I decided to give it a try. If things go south, I can always finish them off quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The trail of blood droplets continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  A murky, dark red mixed with dim light. It was visible even from afar, so there was no worry of losing track.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aaaagh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Cult’s army soldier Lv.23]
 </p>
 <p>
  On one side of the bush.
 </p>
 <p>
  The soldier let out a strange scream as he charged at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I lightly dodged his spear and then plunged my dagger into his neck.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Gah!”
 </p>

 <p>
  Such a pathetic surprise attack.
 </p>
 <p>
  The soldier clutched his throat and fell sideways.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is how the target’s guards often block the way.
 </p>
 <p>
  But they’re hardly considered a threat.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Come to think of it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was strange.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you look closely at the system messages and objects, an entity called the ‘Goddess’ is assisting our mission. When a hero dies, a message appears saying they have returned to the embrace of the Goddess, and all the objects in the mission are shaped like statues of her.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the main enemy in the mission is the Cult’s army.
 </p>
 <p>
  The very people who worship the Goddess.
 </p>
 <p>
  It doesn’t add up.

 <p>
  ‘…’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a needless sentiment.
 </p>
 <p>
  All I needed to do was complete my assigned mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  Strange thoughts only served as distractions.
 </p>
 <p>
  I slaughtered the obstructing soldiers and pursued the target.
 </p>
 <p>
  By the time I reached the middle of the forest.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I got him!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna’s shout came from beyond the trees.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed she had caught a big fish on her side. I quickly jumped over the bushes and headed towards her.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Over here, Oppa!”

 <p>
  In a clearing in the dense forest.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna was aiming her bow at the target.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Silver Flash of Versace Lv.47]
 </p>
 <p>
  On one side of the clearing stood a knight in shattered armor.
 </p>
 <p>
  The armor, which should have been shining silver, had long lost its luster. Her long platinum hair was clumped together with blood and dirt. Two arrows were lodged under her left chest.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve dealt with the lackeys. Did well, didn’t I?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna looked back at me and flashed a grin.
 </p>
 <p>
  Near the knight lay soldiers with arrows in their heads.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The knight looked at me with emotionless eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sheathed my bloodied dagger and spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Drop your sword and kneel. If you follow orders, I won’t kill you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna looked at me as if to ask what I was talking about.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Pria wants us to bring her back alive for interrogation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Will that even clear the mission?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It should.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The mission system should allow for that much flexibility.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You heard him, sister. Just listen and it won’t hurt.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehe.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A bitter smile appeared on the knight’s lips.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Why would I listen to a traitor?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Traitor?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna blinked in surprise.
 </p>
 <p>
  The knight smirked menacingly and muttered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I won’t forgive. Never, never will I forgive. Never, ever…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is she talking about?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t know.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “In that case, die without knowing…!!!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The knight drew her sword and charged.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ping! Jenna pulled her bowstring. The arrowhead pierced the right side of the knight’s chest, but still, she didn’t stop. I stepped firmly on the ground, drew my sword, and slashed long and deep.

 <p>
  Pluck.
 </p>
 <p>
  The crimson blood drew an arc.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud. The knight’s body split in two fell to the ground.

 <p>
  The Following Evening
 </p>
 <p>
  I sat on a bench in the second-floor plaza.
 </p>

 <p>
  Heroes passing by near the square looked at me with strange eyes, but I didn’t mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I wonder when they will come…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Next to me, Iselle fluttered her wings anxiously.
 </p>
 <p>
  In her hand, she held a rainbow-colored stone, and around her forehead, a white band that read ‘Wishing for Success!’
 </p>
 <p>
  [It must not fail, not fail, not fail…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle tightly closed her eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  I wonder why you’re so frantic. I looked up. In the sky, a dark shadow loomed like clouds.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘From 4-stars onward…’
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s a chance of failure.
 </p>
 <p>
  The likelihood is low, even generously less than 1%.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the probability undeniably existed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry. It will definitely succeed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [But.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s only the inept ones who fail.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A hero who has grown normally cannot fail.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Welcome to Pick Me Up!]
 </p>
 <p>
  A notification message from Anytng popped up.
 </p>
 <p>
  He logged in at precisely the same time every day.

  [Ladies and gentlemen, you have been waiting for a long time. The festival of all masters is about to open!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Especially this festa, there are enormous rewards that any master would drool over! Shall I tell you? Rainbow-colored stones for S-rank engravings. And 5-stars… Ahem, that’s all for now. A second announcement will be released soon. Please check there for more details!]

 <p>
  Well, it’s still a long way off from starting.
 </p>
 <p>
  Right now, there are more urgent things. The contents of the notice can wait.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng skipped the announcements and entered the main screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, there is a hero awaiting promotion!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Possible heroes for promotion – ‘Han (★★★)’, ‘Jenna (★★★)’, ‘Velkist (★★★)’]
 </p>
 <p>
  A green notification window popped up at the bottom of the screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng immediately entered the hero box. A list of heroes he owned appeared in quick succession.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Here we gooo!!!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle shivered as if she had been struck by lightning.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, the promotion begins!]

  [Target hero – ‘Han (★★★)’]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The hero will be promoted to 4-stars. The promotion has a low probability of failure, and if it fails, the hero will fall into a ‘corrupted’ state. Would you like to proceed?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tips/ From 4-stars, there is a chance of failure. Heroes who fail the promotion become corrupted, and in this state, they lose their reason and go berserk.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng hesitated for a moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  He seemed hesitant at the warning of possible failure.
 </p>
 <p>
  Naturally. A hero who is corrupted is unusable. There’s no choice but to discard them.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at Anytng, hesitating, and thought strongly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Do it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [The leader of the first party, ‘Han (★★★)’ requests promotion.]

 <p>
  And then.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes (selected) / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud.
 </p>
 <p>
  The door to the synthesis room opened.
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside was the promotion chamber. I stood up, taking the promotion stone that Iselle handed me with trembling hands. Iselle clenched her fists as she looked at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Fighting! You can’t lose!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I smirked and headed toward the synthesis room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna and Velkist should have been here too.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But we could only make one.’

 <p>
  Even though it was a 50% chance, it failed more than ten times.
 </p>
 <p>
  Only one promotion stone was made. What can we do? We have to gather more.
 </p>
 <p>
  The other members of the first party were currently rolling in the daily dungeons.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ll have to share my experience after it’s over.
 </p>
 <p>
  I placed the rainbow-colored stone on the altar in the promotion chamber.
 </p>
 <p>
  Threads of magical power, like spiderwebs, sprouted from the altar, wrapping around the stone, and simultaneously, the magic circle below began to glow purple.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It begins.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Vroom.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked down at my belt.

 <p>
  Bifrost in the sheath was vibrating.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before I could wonder, a flash of light burst from the magic circle and enveloped me.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I opened my eyes again.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dimension 0000 – Townia]
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as I thought, I was thrown into a strange space.
 </p>
 <p>
  First, I looked up. The pale violet sky. Huge pieces of glass slowly rotated and floated around. Beyond that, the scenery was covered in darkness.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Sigh.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I sighed and lowered my gaze.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then, I narrowed my eyes. An impressively large palace was displaying its magnificence ahead, with a tower stretching up to the end of the sky beside it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Where is this now?’
 </p>

 <p>
  Nearby, there was a garden full of nameless flowers and stone walls.
 </p>
 <p>
  No people were in sight.
 </p>
 <p>
  [#!Empty#^Ture##@]
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle. Crack.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a noise, letters carved themselves into the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Floor 0.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Msigsw %#!Type – ?!#?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Mokmok – Email Protected]
 </p>
 <p>
  Is this a joke?
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t understand the letters.
 </p>
 <p>
  The only thing I could read was the Floor 0 at the top.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Floor zero…?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, there is no such thing as a floor zero in Pick Me Up.
 </p>
 <p>
  What this meant, I would have to find out by going to the end.
 </p>
 <p>
  I followed the marble path leading to the grand doors of the palace.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Where is this place.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was obvious this was no ordinary place.
 </p>
 <p>
  The air was as cold as if I had entered a freezer, and the surrounding scenery was desaturated.
 </p>
 <p>
  As if the saturation had been lowered.
 </p>
 <p>
  As I nearly reached the grand doors, a large sign hanging above caught my eye.
 </p>

 <p>
  I read the letters, which were decorated with jewels, on the sign.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ragnasar’s Palace]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Throne for the Master of Gold]
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria’s face came to mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  Was this a place where the emperor of the empire stayed?
 </p>
 <p>
  I pushed the gold and silver decorated grand doors.
 </p>
 <p>
  Creak. With an old metallic sound, the doors began to open.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  As I entered, the doors closed as if they had been waiting.
 </p>
 <p>
  I pushed slightly, but they didn’t budge. They seemed locked.

 </p>
 <p>
  The space inside was endlessly vast.
 </p>
 <p>
  On both sides were pillars made of marble, and a red carpet led to the center.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Golden Court]
 </p>
 <p>
  It was kindly informed.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was where the emperor stayed.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had always wanted to see his face.
 </p>
 <p>
  I followed the carpet.

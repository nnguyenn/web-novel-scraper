 <p>
  She was crouching in the corner of the table.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her slender silver hair was adorned with a golden crown, dressed in a silvery white gown.

 <p>
  I squinted my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had seen her several times before. I couldn’t possibly mistake her.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just days ago, we had faced each other directly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Pria.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Her appearance was strangely unfamiliar.
 </p>
 <p>
  Tears were welling up in her golden eyes, and she bit her lips hard enough to bleed.
 </p>
 <p>
  What is she so grievous about?
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Sigh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I sighed and settled into an empty seat.
 </p>
 <p>
  After crossing my legs, I slowly looked around.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even though we have been defeated, I do not regret it. Everyone did their best and did what they could. We were united beyond class and racial differences and fought with one body and one mind.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The young man’s speech continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  Several at the table were moved to tears.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  A groan escaped from Pria’s lips.
 </p>
 <p>
  I shifted my gaze across the table. Behind the vacant throne, there stood a twin goddess statue made of marble, their hands clasped together. One of the faces remained vividly in my mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  I snickered.
 </p>
 <p>
  In truth, it was obvious who it was.

 <p>
  No need for predictions.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The twin goddesses ruling over Townia,’ as Neryssa had told me.
 </p>
 <p>
  The two goddesses are called ‘Tel’ and ‘Ikar.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was said that the saintess directly receives the oracle from the goddess.
 </p>
 <p>
  I crossed my arms.
 </p>
 <p>
  The goddess statue, which should have been just a decoration, had its eyes glowing red.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, almost no one seemed to notice.
 </p>
 <p>
  Everyone was engrossed in the young man’s speech.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thump!
 </p>
 <p>
  The entire palace shook violently.
 </p>

 <p>
  Stone debris from the ceiling smashed part of the table.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s not much time left, it seems.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The young man smiled bitterly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The knight standing beside him spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “According to reports, within an hour they will storm the palace.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It means we only have that much time left.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “My apologies.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, it’s not your fault. We all did our best. Who can blame anyone?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the young man comforted him, the knight bowed deeply in gratitude.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, at first glance, it was a heartwarming scene.

 <p>
  ‘How disgusting.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A sinister voice, as if scratching the inside of the ears, emitted.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked across the table. Where previously there was no one, a shadow writhed and then formed a shape.
 </p>
 <p>
  [SS▩SH黑⊙∈※ Lv.999]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you think, don’t you agree?”
 </p>
 <p>
  A girl with ebony hair looked at me and smiled.
 </p>
 <p>
  She had a definite presence in the faint landscape.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s been a while since I’ve seen you in person like this. You’ve come this far alive. Truly, you’re the master I’ve chosen.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Tel smiled softly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why did you come out? I hate seeing you.”
 </p>

  “I’m saddened. I barely managed to squeeze in time amid preparing for the event.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Go away, will you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Tel gulped down a tar-like viscous liquid from a wine glass.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t it disgusting, Loki? They lost. Pathetically failed. But now they say they did their best, they have no regrets. They’re just comforting themselves.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Except for one, they’re all trash. Not worth saving.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Tel, with a sensual motion, stroked Pria’s cheek, who remained crouched, seemingly feeling nothing.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hehehehe…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Tel let out a chilling laugh, then dispersed into shadows.
 </p>
 <p>
  I leaned back in the chair deeply as the young man continued speaking.

  “Does anyone have anything else to say? Anyone is fine. If you have something to say…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria raised her hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the same moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Uh?’
 </p>
 <p>
  A loud rumble began.
 </p>
 <p>
  I gripped the sheath of my sword; the shaking soon subsided.
 </p>
 <p>
  “My precious sister. You too have worked hard. You have supported us wholeheartedly…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your Highness.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria spoke clearly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I do not wish for it to end here.”

 <p>
  The atmosphere in the room tensed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Everyone listen!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria suddenly stood up and slammed the desk.
 </p>
 <p>
  “For such an ending, for such a conclusion, did we fight, shedding blood and sweat? We did our best but lost? Are you satisfied with just this? Was this all that you sought to protect? Is this how you break in the face of crisis?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you not even… not even angry!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria screamed as if in agony.
 </p>
 <p>
  The previously peaceful atmosphere at the table turned icy cold.
 </p>
 <p>
  The smiles vanished from everyone’s faces.

  “Look at the faces of our kind behind you. They are scared. They are frightened. And you, who are supposed to lead, have you given up with your hands still free? Aren’t you ashamed before your ancestors!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This insolence! How dare you speak such nonsense! Even if you are of golden lineage…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shut up!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria shouted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I will not accept such an ending. To enjoy a banquet here and then just let it end? Ridiculous! Even now, our warriors outside are shedding their blood!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So… what do you propose, Your Highness?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The purple-robed sorceress laughed.
 </p>
 <p>
  A name tag above her head read ‘Head of Shutenberg.’
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not that we are not upset. But nothing worked. In the end, this is how it turned out. What would Your Highness like to do? Rage and stomp around?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I understand Your Highness’s heart, too. But an unavoidable outcome has been reached. Sometimes, we need to accept fate. That’s the last pride left to us.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But… there is still one way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria spoke quietly, her gaze turning towards the lectern on the right side of the table.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Saintess, has not an oracle from the goddess come down? I heard it contains a crucial clue to save the continent. Then why keep it a secret?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The girl called the saintess, wearing a white coat, remained silent.
 </p>
 <p>
  The female knight beside her spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your Highness, the saintess did not arbitrarily hide the oracle. You may be mistaken.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Silver Flash Versace.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yesterday, I personally sliced that woman in two halves.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria shook her head at Versace’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s no mistake. I clearly heard it. The goddess offered us one chance… a chance to start everything over.”

  “Your Highness, what are you saying?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Turn back time. To a few years ago.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A hint of an answer was slowly forming.
 </p>
 <p>
  The reason for showing this scene seemed clear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Informing the heroes of the purpose of their mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If that’s the case…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Would the next heroes to be promoted see a similar scene?
 </p>
 <p>
  It was natural for their attitude to change after their promotion. Of course, it was still too early to judge. There were still unanswered questions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Turn back time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The sorceress’s eyes narrowed.

 <p>
  Pria looked around at those present and continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If we go back, a different outcome might be possible. Isn’t it too regrettable to sit down without knowing anything, not even knowing the identity of the enemy? I can’t accept it. Even if there’s a very low chance, shouldn’t we try every possible method?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that true?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The eyes of the Beast King narrowed towards the saintess.

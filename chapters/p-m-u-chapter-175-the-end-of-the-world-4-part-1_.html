 <p>
  The girl slowly walked towards where everyone was gathered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each step of her small, bare, white feet made the massive shadow behind her waver. The shadow, engulfing the light around it, billowed in deep black.

 <p>
  [Nothing but fools and ignorants all around.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The girl smirked.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Heroes, you say. Even when given a chance to redeem yourselves, you boot it away. How utterly foolish. Or are you scared? Either way, it’s pitiful.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you! How rude!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A knight drew his sword and stepped forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  The girl snickered and then reached out her hand towards him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As if grabbed by an invisible hand, the knight was hoisted into the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the girl clenched her fist, the knight was crushed, sending fragments of his armor and splatters of blood and flesh scattering. She dusted off her hands and laughed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [A dog that doesn’t recognize its master doesn’t deserve life, don’t you think?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The saintess murmured quietly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…O Goddess.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes, I am your master.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Members of the church knelt all at once.
 </p>
 <p>
  The girl looked down at the saintess with an expression dripping with displeasure.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I clearly gave an oracle. Why act on your own?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “We just…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [No excuses needed. Are you really my apostles? You only use me when it’s convenient, but turn your backs when I truly need you.]

 <p>
  The girl looked over the heroes standing stiffly.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I, Tel, made it clear. I gave you all a chance to start over. And you dare refuse? There’s a limit to shamelessness.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “We are thankful for the grace bestowed by the Goddess. However, we desire… we wish for the end that we want. Please… grant us that!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The saintess bowed her head to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the same time, the clerics and paladins also bowed their heads.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hehehe……..]
 </p>
 <p>
  Tel grabbed her forehead and burst out laughing.
 </p>
 <p>
  A laugh that grated on everyone’s nerves.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Since when did dogs begin to object to their master’s commands?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “We are not dogs…”

  [Your words, the air you breathe, the bread and meat you eat, the ground you stand on, even down to each hair and soul, are all mine. All just my playthings. You wish to die with dignity? Who gave you the right.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Tel stepped on the head of the saintess.
 </p>
 <p>
  The saintess did not move.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This is not the end of Townia, right?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Tel smirked and looked at Pria.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria flinched silently.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Step aside.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The smile disappeared from Tel’s lips.
 </p>
 <p>
  A young man clad in a golden coat came forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Goddess has indeed granted us grace. But the right to decide our fate lies with us.”
 </p>

 <p>
  [You speak too boldly.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Return from where you came. Let us meet a proper end.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Tel glared at the young man.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Impudent.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I am of a golden lineage that dates back to the dawn of the empire. I believe I have the right to speak to the Goddess in such a manner.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [A monstrous hybrid, aren’t you?]
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as Tel uttered ‘hybrid,’ weapons were pointed from all around.
 </p>
 <p>
  Tel smirked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You stopped worshiping me, and now this defiance?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Goddess has changed completely. I do not know what happened, but I will no longer tolerate this tyranny.”

 <p>
  I sat in the chair, crossing my legs.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had already predicted that the person who brought me here was Mobius’ director and Goddess, given the many hints. However, this development was quite unexpected.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Were they adversaries?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Given the Goddess’s actions, she seemed not to be omnipotent.
 </p>
 <p>
  If she were an infinite being, she could simply reverse the world with her powers, no need for an oracle or consent.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A price must be paid for miracles.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as she used the Earth to twist Mobius’ spacetime.
 </p>
 <p>
  What then is the price for this descent?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Only one thing.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned to Pria.
 </p>

 <p>
  Once a hero,
 </p>
 <p>
  Now turned into a ‘witch,’ the reason these spirits curse and resent Pria.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You won’t tolerate it?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right. Return.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Tel sneered coldly.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Sorry, but the contract has already been signed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Aren’t you curious how that child knew about the oracle?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Tel pointed at Pria.
 </p>

 <p>
  Pria trembled and shouted,
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you talking about! I never made a contract with you…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That child said she would give everything to save Townia.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria’s face filled with confusion.
 </p>
 <p>
  Everyone’s gaze turned to Pria.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, no! I never said that! I don’t even know this woman!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [She told me that she wanted to do it again, even if it meant risking herself and everything around her.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Tel’s lips curled into a cold smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I, the Goddess of Purity ‘Tel,’ declare upon my soul that this is the absolute truth.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t lie!”

 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait… wait…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria stumbled back.
 </p>
 <p>
  “D-Did something like this happen?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes, you’ve sold them out.]

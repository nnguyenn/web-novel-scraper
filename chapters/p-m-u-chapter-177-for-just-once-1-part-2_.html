  ‘They want us to compete at similar levels.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I like this.

  I went through the rules again. During the Festa period, events were held throughout the city, and heroes had to participate in multiple events to achieve high rankings.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That’s the basics.’
 </p>
 <p>
  For more details, I’d have to go there myself.
 </p>
 <p>
  I rose from my chair. It was late evening, but there were still guys working.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Damn it……”
 </p>
 <p>
  In the hangar at the gap between dimensions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio was grumbling as he checked the airship system.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng had called the resting Katiio to order the airship’s maintenance.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You said no overtime when you lured me in……”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I cleared my throat as I approached Katiio.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How’s the maintenance going?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No big issues. As long as there’s enough fuel. But why are we doing maintenance? Planning to go somewhere?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio turned to look at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dark circles were under his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked up at the Capitalism.
 </p>
 <p>
  It had been upgraded with better parts. Every part of the deck had been replaced with steel, the weapons mounted were bigger and stronger, and the engine had been enhanced for more thrust.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s an event.”
 </p>

  “An event?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You can get some flashy items.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I feel like I’ve heard of that somewhere…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio tilted his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  I continued with a smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry. You’re not coming.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The mechanic will be used as the driver.
 </p>
 <p>
  The members participating in the event had already been decided.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng had already formed the party.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Forming a party.]

 </p>
 <p>
  [Edis(★★★★) joins ‘Bring the Ticket!’]
 </p>
 <p>
  Bring the Ticket.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even the party name was deliberately chosen.
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There’s been a change in members.’
 </p>

 <p>
  Excluding Katiio and including Edis was a natural move if one carefully considered my strategy. Such events usually flow with individual competitions. The wizard class, weak in 1-on-1, doesn’t fit.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s decided.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Our Townia will participate in this Festa.
 </p>
 <p>
  The airship, maintenance completed, awaited departure.
 </p>
 <p>
  I immediately gathered the participating members and explained the purpose of the event.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Um, so…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna scratched her cheek.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What should we call this? What is it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t it like a sports day?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Similar. There are various competitions. Anyway, we’re going to the Dimensional City to sweep up the prizes. Our party was for that reason.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “But I’m not part of the first party?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This time, Katiio is resting. Edis, you’ll take his place.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist frowned unpleasantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “To be involved in such childish games… I’m busy with training.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not a child’s game. We will risk our lives there. We won’t actually die, but it’s almost like that. And there are two things there you’ll like.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Every Raid Festa invariably hosts two events.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first is an individual tournament. The second is a team tournament. Massive prizes and points are at stake in the special events of the Dimensional City.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thought you’d just kick a ball around and play? It’s about having a battle with the other guys gathering there.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That wouldn’t be too bad then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He was easy to persuade. In many ways.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-6" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  Kishasha and Jenna, since I suggested it, agreed without much complaint, and Edis, although somewhat dubious, ultimately consented. It was beneficial to give Edis, who would control the raid in my stead, this experience.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thousands will gather.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I lowered my voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Those gathering there are all chicks. While we’ve been struggling hard, they’ve been leisurely camping on easy missions.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Our goal is clear.”
 </p>
 <p>
  First place.
 </p>
 <p>
  To bring back the 5-star summon ticket as Anytng hopes, that’s the only way.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The possibility isn’t low.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The difficulty of Townia’s missions is nonsensical.
 </p>

 <p>
  To clear them, the heroes of Townia must also become comparably strong.
 </p>
 <p>
  These guys don’t know how strong they are.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They’ll gain some confidence.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It will help boost morale.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anyway,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Just keep piling up the Warhorse Statues.’
 </p>
 <p>
  And I’ll bring you the item you want.

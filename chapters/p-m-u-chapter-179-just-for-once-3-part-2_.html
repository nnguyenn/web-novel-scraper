  ‘Anyway.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ll have to talk to him myself.

 <p>
  As soon as possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  That evening, a meeting was convened with all the members of the event party.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This festival has three special events. A 1-on-1 individual match, a 3-on-3 team match, and a random event. To win, you need to succeed in all three.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I continued,
 </p>
 <p>
  “The important point is, it’s difficult for those who participate in one event to challenge another.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The problem was timing.
 </p>
 <p>
  The individual and team matches were held concurrently, so it was impossible for the winner of the individual match to compete in the team match.
 </p>
 <p>
  “One person for the individual match. Three for the team match. And one more for the remaining event. In other words, we need to divide our forces in advance.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve heard about that. The members have already been decided, haven’t they?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The members for the individual and team matches had been predetermined.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kishasha, Edis, and Jenna for the team match.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The individual match is mine.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can you win?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist smiled silently.
 </p>
 <p>
  Originally, I was to compete in the individual match…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘We don’t know which event will come up.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s better if I go.
 </p>

 <p>
  Consequently, Velkist was set to participate in the individual match.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We need to win all. If we don’t, getting a 5-star summon ticket will be tough.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Niflheimr will be there too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We have to win. Do you have any doubts?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna twisted her hair.
 </p>
 <p>
  She would never say she doubted herself.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Whether it’s Niflheimr or the demon himself, if they show up, we’ll beat them. Can you do it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll try.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good. Go to sleep early tonight. It’ll be busy starting tomorrow.”
 </p>

 <p>
  The meeting ended.
 </p>
 <p>
  I forcibly sent the members who wanted to train in preparation back to their rooms.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s better to manage our condition than to stay up all night trying to sync up. Despite their complaints, they all went to bed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You should sleep early too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, I wasn’t planning on sleeping yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  Participating in an unknown event, I had to plan for all possibilities.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was used to staying up all night. It wouldn’t be a problem for me. I focused on strategizing with the lamp on in the living room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, as the stars outside began to fade,
 </p>
 <p>
  Knock, knock. There was a knock at the front door.
 </p>

 <p>
  What now?
 </p>
 <p>
  It was deep into the night.
 </p>
 <p>
  I put away my papers and pen and headed to the front door.
 </p>
 <p>
  My left hand rested on the hilt of my dagger, ready for any surprise attack.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who is it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  An unexpected figure was waiting outside.
 </p>
 <p>
  He looked at my face and then bowed his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sorry if you were sleeping. I can come back later…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, I wasn’t sleeping. Come in.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you.”
 </p>

 <p>
  When I opened the door, Aaron entered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron alternated his gaze between me and the floor, looking nervous.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you doing? Just standing there like that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, yes!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron hurried into the living room.
 </p>
 <p>
  I placed two glasses of water on the table and sat opposite him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The other members…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They’re asleep. It’s late.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m really sorry. There was no other time…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s fine.”
 </p>

 <p>
  I took a sip of water.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s been a while. Have you been well?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, I’ve been doing well. I’m relieved to see that you, Jenna, and Lady Edis are safe.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That so. Do we look like we could easily die?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled.
 </p>
 <p>
  I decided not to mention Eloka.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was better to keep that covered up.
 </p>
 <p>
  I examined Aaron closely.
 </p>
 <p>
  Up close, he was awkwardly wearing a wrinkled uniform.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was quite different from the other Niflheimr members in crisply ironed clothes. He was stooped, and his hands were tightly wrapped in white bandages. Calluses and scabs could be glimpsed through the bandages.

 <p>
  ‘Seems the same.’
 </p>
 <p>
  That foolish training regimen too.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How did you know we were here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master told me. He said Hyung-nim would be here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Myuden.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took another sip of water.
 </p>
 <p>
  Silence lingered until Aaron decided to speak.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I should tell you first…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Go ahead.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I haven’t switched to Niflheimr.”
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-12" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
  <script async="" crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4984013611805253">

 <p>
  I figured.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t in Aaron’s nature to switch sides.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why are you here then?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I came at my master’s recommendation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s about time to descend the mountain.
 </p>
 <p>
  I thought it was still early. I finished my cup of water.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hyung-nim, I am scheduled to compete in this tournament as a member of Niflheimr.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You must have faced fierce competition. Well done.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It wasn’t exactly competition; it was more like being parachuted in, maybe.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron bowed his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s why the Niflheimr trainees were cold to him.
 </p>
 <p>
  The uniform didn’t fit him well, as if it had been decided abruptly. But there are no parachutes in Niflheimr. Without the appropriate skills, opportunities are not given.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How’s the training going?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It was hell every day. It still is, actually.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron scratched his cheek.
 </p>
 <p>
  His hands showed he was undergoing rigorous training.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m somehow keeping up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why does your answer lack conviction? After all the effort to send you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sorry.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I laughed and finished my water.
 </p>

 <p>
  Now for the main point.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, why are you here? I’m from Townia, and you’re from Niflheimr. You’re not asking me to go easy on you in the tournament, are you? It must still be a long way off for you to return.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s not it. I just wanted to tell you about my decision.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your decision?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron took a deep breath.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed he had something important to say.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hyung-nim. I will be competing in the individual category of this event.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron looked down at his bandaged hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If I win the individual tournament…”
 </p>
 <p>
  He clenched his fist.

  “Are you confident you can win?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m planning to do my best. For now.”

 <p>
  I sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  If what I saw in the preliminary arena was his full capability, his chances weren’t high.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not to mention Niflheimr’s guy, and especially Velkist, who had advanced another step. Even if that guy is a genius, Velkist has another talent that the genius doesn’t. I’m confident Velkist will beat Niflheimr’s top student. That’s why I sent Velkist to the individual event.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron and I chatted for about 30 minutes before he left.
 </p>
 <p>
  The chat included stories about Velkist. He had become unrecognizably strong. Even as he praised another guy, Aaron maintained a bright expression throughout.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Really.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I felt bitter.
 </p>
 <p>
  Myuden was a special case.
 </p>
 <p>
  In reality, as in Pick Me Up, effort and achievement do not always correlate, I was well aware.
 </p>
 <p>
  Knowing the low likelihood of Aaron’s growth,
 </p>
 <p>
  It was I who had sent that guy to Myuden.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘After this tournament, I should contact Yurnet.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If there really was no significant progress, I wouldn’t want that fool to suffer any longer.
 </p>
 <p>
  I should forcibly tell him to come back.
 </p>
 <p>
  The position of instructor for Aaron was still vacant.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the next day of the first main round.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Who filed a complaint calling it boring! Speak up, quick!]
 </p>
 <p>
  A red-faced fairy was jumping up and down.
 </p>

 <p>
  [How dare you call the battle royale that I painstakingly created boring! I’ll smash your skull! Is it you, you irregularly employed slave, jealous of a regular employee like me?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The fairy was grabbing a staff member by the collar and shaking him uncontrollably.
 </p>
 <p>
  It could be boring. Even the BJ’s broadcasting occasionally from a four-star city had all stopped their broadcasts before reaching the latter half of the preliminary round.
 </p>
 <p>
  The reason was simple.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it’s a survival game, there’s no need to fight desperately until the very end.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was enough to find a good spot, set up a base, and camp out. Even if they encountered other heroes, they could just ignore them and pass by. Fighting would only bring loss.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since everyone thought the same, almost no battles occurred throughout the day.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, there were exceptions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “He’s the mad dog!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A woman who caught my eye screamed and retreated.

  “That’s the mad dog…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The lunatic who goes insane at the sight of blood, right? Totally…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He’s the one who hunted down and killed everyone who tried to escape…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The heroes were murmuring around me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Others get called the second coming while I get called a mad dog?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I remembered all their faces.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [Starting today, I’ll add a special rule! Twinkle Fairy Power!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The fairy waved a small star wand.
 </p>
 <p>
  [4. The speed at which the field shrinks will be faster! Outside the field, a magnetic field will be generated, and contact with it will result in immediate death.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [5. The quality and quantity of supplies scattered throughout the field will increase. Also, if you kill opponents consecutively, you will receive bonus points. Kill as much as you want!]

  The rules were added to the explanation panel on the right side of the screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This first main round will involve 10 people. As you can see, I’ve added trendy rules. You can feel the speed, and it will end quickly. Everyone, start!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Slap!
 </p>
 <p>
  The fairy swung the whip in her left hand, and the preparations for the main round began.
 </p>
 <p>
  The number of participants in this first main round was 10. With the field narrowed, a quick decision was expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  And.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Was it bonus points?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Killing participants would earn points.
 </p>
 <p>
  Calculating; killing everyone would earn points equivalent to winning two mini-games.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Group 2! Has everyone gathered?”
 </p>

 <p>
  A female staff member looked around at the participants.
 </p>
 <p>
  A dimensional gate was created and during the process of returning items to the display case.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Gasp, I’m in the same group as the mad dog… Uh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A man whose eyes met mine covered his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mad dog?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, nothing!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The man hurriedly retreated.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were 9 participants gathered for this Group 2.
 </p>
 <p>
  They began murmuring as they looked at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that guy really that strong?”

  “We should join forces first…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I heard everything.
 </p>
 <p>
  This has become troublesome.
 </p>
 <p>
  9 against 1.
 </p>
 <p>
  Why did it turn out this way?
 </p>
 <p>
  In just one day rumors about me had spread to all the participants of the battle royale.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, I had been noticeable, but it shouldn’t have been to this extent.
 </p>
 <p>
  It didn’t feel natural.
 </p>
 <p>
  As if someone had deliberately done it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I was going to take it easy today.’

 <p>
  I planned to watch the individual main round and focus only on the final round of the battle royale.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the quality of the participating heroes will increase, I intended to proceed slowly.
 </p>
 <p>
  But, unintentionally, my plans got twisted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehe…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned around.
 </p>
 <p>
  Beyond the crowd, a woman with blonde hair and a flashy appearance was smiling.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the woman who had called the other heroes trash yesterday.
 </p>
 <p>
  Was I caught on that woman’s radar? Well, it doesn’t matter.
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled and turned my back.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hey you!]
 </p>

 <p>
  While I was waiting to participate, the fairy on the podium flew over swiftly.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I heard the rumors! The game that you won was so entertaining, and there’s been a lot of praise. I’m looking forward to this one too. Please do well in this match. I’m aiming to get a full-time job, I’m counting on you!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The fairy laughed heartily and patted my shoulder.
 </p>
 <p>
  I said quietly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If I kill everyone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “If I alone kill all 9 participants, is there a bonus or something?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The fairy blinked and then burst out laughing.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ohoho! Cool! If you alone kill all 9 participants, I’ll double the bonus points for you!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I ignored the other participants, who were busy planning to eliminate me and entered the dimensional gate first.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mad dog.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then it wouldn’t be bad to live up to that name.

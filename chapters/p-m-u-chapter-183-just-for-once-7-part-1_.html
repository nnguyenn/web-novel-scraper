  As the familiar sensation of weightlessness enveloped me, a hologram message appeared, signaling the mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Floor ?]

  [This is a special event field.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Objective – Survive until only one remains!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The matrix revealed a torn mattress and a toppled bookshelf, the chaotic scene of a modern-style room displayed.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed I had been summoned to an isolated building again.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Danger!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The field will shrink in 5 minutes!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Move to the marked safe zone on the map!]
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as it started, a warning message popped up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looks like it will end quickly this time.
 </p>
 <p>
  The number of participants had decreased too.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’m rather welcoming of it.
 </p>
 <p>
  I scouted the interior of the building for useful items.
 </p>
 <p>
  Outside the window, at the intersection, players were running.
 </p>
 <p>
  Three in total, running in the same direction. It seemed they were gathering in the middle area of the map. Clearly, the collusion among the other players had finished. They had formed a party of nine and decided to deal with me first.
 </p>
 <p>
  Given this situation, there wasn’t much time.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took out the weapon I had found in the house.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then I jumped out of the second-floor window.
 </p>
 <p>
  [1Kill!]

 <p>
  Clang!
 </p>
 <p>
  A clear and beautiful sound echoed as a man collapsed in mid-run, his head caved in.
 </p>
 <p>
  A dagger flew from the hand of another man nearby.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang! I deflected the dagger with a frying pan in my right hand, then immediately got close and struck him under the chin. Thump! Then, I drove my heel into the back of the fallen man’s head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Argh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [2Kill!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The last one.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was already running away far in the distance.
 </p>
 <p>
  I threw the frying pan at him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thump!

 <p>
  The man was hit on the head by the edge of the pan and fell sideways.
 </p>
 <p>
  I dashed up and grabbed him by the scruff of his neck. He wasn’t dead yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where were you supposed to meet?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite bleeding from his forehead, the man kept his mouth shut.
 </p>
 <p>
  But his eyes briefly darted to a ruined building across the intersection.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That’s the place.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was easy to predict.
 </p>
 <p>
  If there’s a conspicuous place where scattered members could quickly gather, it had to be there.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You crazy mad dog… even if you…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

  I hit the fallen man’s head with the frying pan five times until he was finally deemed dead.
 </p>
 <p>
  [3Kill!]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It will get annoying if it drags on.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Under normal circumstances, this would have been the perfect time to leisurely farm items and camp…
 </p>
 <p>
  Sigh.
 </p>
 <p>
  I ran down the road with the dented frying pan.

 </p>
 <p>
  First a crazy dog, now a lunatic out of control?
 </p>
 <p>
  Unfortunately, the map was obscured by the viewer’s screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, I could see the viewers’ chat.
 </p>
 <p>
  [RoadWarrior (HMDM11): Is that the lunatic? Looks familiar.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [DietDouble: Only 5 minutes in and already 3 kills. Crazy…]
 </p>
 <p>
  This is distracting.
 </p>
 <p>
  I moved the broadcast screen to the corner and continued my pace.
 </p>
 <p>
  Along the way, in a trash-filled alley, I found a rusty iron pipe.
 </p>
 <p>
  And a minute later.

 <p>
  I arrived at the rendezvous point.
 </p>
 <p>
  The square in front of the ruined building.
 </p>
 <p>
  Three men, two women. Five in total were waiting for me.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were armed with swords, spears, shields, and bows. They made no effort to hide their presence, surely aware that I was coming.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The man at the front, with a serious expression, spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you a born 4-star?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nope.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I held a frying pan in my left hand and the iron pipe in my right.

 <p>
  And 10 minutes later.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I was squatting on the ground of the square.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ptui.
 </p>
 <p>
  I spat the blood pooled in my mouth. I hadn’t expected a magician to be among them. It took quite some time to deal with them.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh… ack… ack…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Groans were heard.
 </p>
 <p>
  Turning around, I saw five stacked bodies looking like blocks.
 </p>
 <p>
  The one on top seemed alive, though he looked like he would die soon from his wounds.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Monster…”

 </p>
 <p>
  Work hard first before complaining.
 </p>
 <p>
  Losing to a frying pan while armed with swords and spears doesn’t make sense.
 </p>
 <p>
  I clicked my tongue and stood up.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Taiwan (No1): What? Killed them all with just a frying pan?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Psyco53: Lmao real psycho lol]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Sans (Papyrus): Wow! A frying pan! And an iron pipe! PPAK!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Niceguy33: I think I’ve seen him before. Remember that viral video? That hero who carried his clueless master.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [ToMuch7: Oh! That video, I remember. I was in LA back then…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [LastRive (Neven13): Isn’t that him? Check it out. I think there’s an update for the 40th floor too.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [TooMuchPain (SeeyouAgain1): Was that him? He was really strong! Why hasn’t he competed in singles? He could rival Niflheimr.]
 </p>
 <p>
  One left.
 </p>
 <p>
  He must be here somewhere.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seems like a rogue class, trying to stay hidden.
 </p>
 <p>
  I spun the blood-soaked frying pan and said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come out in 10 seconds. If you get caught by me, you’re dead.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, what if I don’t get caught?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ll still die.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Damn it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The presence vanished.

  As soon as the message appeared, the curtain of a three-story building in front fluttered.

 <p>
  There he is. I stood up with a smile, holding the blood-stained frying pan.

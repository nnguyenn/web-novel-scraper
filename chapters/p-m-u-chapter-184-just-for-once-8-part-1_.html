 <p>
  If we coolly evaluate, the most advantageous class in this Battle Royale finale was the rogue.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the finals where the number of participants is small and the map is narrow, other classes could also perform to some extent. However, in a massive game involving about 100 participants, it was a different story.

  [Survivor Count – 21]
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked up at the screen above.
 </p>
 <p>
  21 survivors left. The unskilled fighters who had been brawling chaotically were already filtered out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, the likelihood of a large-scale frontal assault among the survivors was slim. Everyone was aiming for a windfall.
 </p>
 <p>
  If no frontal assault occurred, it was the rogues’ stage to shine, capable of stealth and ambushes, and excellent in locating enemies.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you glad you joined our party?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sadine spoke in a gentle tone.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Imagine if you were alone. You wouldn’t be able to farm items, and other parties would have ganged up on you. It’s so much easier with a rogue around. To scout ahead and pinpoint enemy positions.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  This woman.
 </p>
 <p>
  As I felt yesterday, she talks a lot.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially after we fought over the ownership of this building. I had single-handedly knocked out three people.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Han, I was impressed with the fight earlier. You are exceptional. I can’t believe someone like you came from a level 40 waiting room. Consider my proposal carefully. With you and me…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I examined the holographic map.
 </p>
 <p>
  The safe zone was marked with a white circle. We were located in a small town’s commercial area, right at the center. A prime zone littered with high-end items, with simple traps installed at all exits including windows to detect intrusions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Quality leather armor and a usable longsword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Throwing knives and a crossbow as well. All enchanted.
 </p>
 <p>
  Consumables too. It seems we’ve farmed enough.

 <p>
  “Our Lakereia, you see, has seven floors and various luxurious facilities…”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘4 teams.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Out of 21 people, 17 were operating in teams.
 </p>
 <p>
  The remaining four were solo players.
 </p>
 <p>
  These were the results of constant searches by the four-star rogues in my party.
 </p>
 <p>
  The composition and operational areas of the enemies were almost fully understood.
 </p>
 <p>
  It really is useful. I wouldn’t have gotten this information if I moved alone.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How did you find the beverage I gave you yesterday? Wasn’t it incredibly tasty? I’m quite picky, but it was quite good…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I wonder how Jenna’s party is doing.
 </p>
 <p>
  By now, the group finals must be in full swing.

 <p>
  The individual match, starting in the afternoon, is still pending.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’m curious but.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I decided to focus on my own tasks first.
 </p>
 <p>
  After tallying the points I collected yesterday, to comfortably secure the overall first place, we had to win in all three major events. The score from the mini-game Anytng played was despairing.
 </p>
 <p>
  I leaned against the wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was some time left until the next zone restriction.
 </p>
 <p>
  No need to fight, so, relax…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oppa, can you hear me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I opened my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s me. Jenna.”

 <p>
  A marstone hidden in my chest emitted a faint light.
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio’s communication stone. I had kept it as an emergency item, managing to hide it by tucking it into the crease of my collar.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Excuse me for a moment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where are you going? We’re in the middle of strategizing…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Bathroom.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I answered briefly and headed up the stairs.
 </p>
 <p>
  After distancing myself a bit, I grasped the communication stone in my hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then I whispered, ensuring no one could hear.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s up?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, so you can hear me. I thought it was broken.”

  “Sorry. I have something to report.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Edis was poisoned in the recent match.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The healing potions aren’t working. It seems to be a special kind of paralytic poison. They won’t give us an antidote. The next match is soon, what should we do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I sighed deeply.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll try something, just Kishasha and I.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s impossible with just the two of you. Niflheimr is also there.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If we even manage a second place in one of the events, it’s over for us.

 </p>
 <p>
  “How much time till the next match?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “About 10 minutes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That should be enough. Run now and find Velkist in the individual match arena. There are no restrictions on participation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh? What do you mean…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Didn’t you read the flyer? If it’s the same affiliation, there are no restrictions on player replacement.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then you’re ruining the individual match! If we just endure and find a way to heal Edis…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The effect will last at least three hours, by then the finals will be over. Hey, stop wasting time and do as I say. Take Velkist, put him in for Edis. Win no matter what. Or do you want to see the master crying?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But the individual match…”

  “I’ll participate in it.”

  I cut off the communication.
 </p>
 <p>
  The holographic map displayed a clock.
 </p>
 <p>
  10:57 AM. The individual match finals started at 12 PM.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What took you so long? Besides, about the proposal…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssshhh.
 </p>
 <p>
  I drew my sword from its sheath.
 </p>
 <p>
  All enemies’ locations were known. Our allies’ locations were the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had previously embedded a magic item, the Tracker’s Scent, on the two annoying rogues. I prepared to jump out of the window.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait, what are you doing?! Our strategy is to wait until the very end…”

  “The situation has changed. Don’t worry. I won’t betray you until only four people are left.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “And don’t drink trash drinks like mint chocolate.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud.
 </p>
 <p>
  I jumped down from several meters high and landed on the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the same time, an arrow aimed at my forehead flew towards me. I waved my left hand. The arrow shaft was caught at my fingertips. A team was hiding in the building right in front.
 </p>
 <p>
  I quickly calculated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Including the travel distance…
 </p>
 <p>
  How much time is left? 10 minutes?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Phew.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t want to use this.
 </p>
 <p>
  I flipped the switch in my mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★★★★)’ has entered Ascend State!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come out, you bastards!”
 </p>
 <p>
  And then.
 </p>
 <p>
  …
 </p>
 <p>
  [Wow, amazing! I couldn’t even imagine this. Are you Rambo or something? Truly the mad dog of Battle Royale! I hope you participate in the next event as well. Here is the prize and the winning trophy, a golden frying pan…]
 </p>
 <p>
  I snatched the Advent Stone from the rambling fairy’s hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  The aftereffects of Ascend blurred my vision. I passed the dumbstruck fairy and pushed through the crowd.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Wait! The golden frying pan!]

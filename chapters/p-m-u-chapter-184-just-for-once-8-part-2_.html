 <p>
  [Gasp!]
 </p>
 <p>
  I bit into a healing potion as I exited the stadium.
 </p>
 <p>
  The current time was 11:41 AM. No shuttle buses were running at this hour.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Anytng.’
 </p>
 <p>
  You must be watching.
 </p>
 <p>
  You understand the gravity of the situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis was injured. We were at risk of missing the 5-star summon ticket.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, ‘Han (★★★★)’ is requesting assistance!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng immediately displayed the tactical tool.
 </p>
 <p>
  Woosh. A red arrow appeared in the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  I ran at full speed towards the direction indicated by the arrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  A bright red sports car was cruising down the road.
 </p>
 <p>
  I jumped over the lanes and charged at the sports car. I locked eyes with the man in the driver’s seat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait, you…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  With all my strength, I kicked the door open, sending a panel of metal flying.
 </p>
 <p>
  I pulled the flustered man out of the driver’s seat and threw him onto the road.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, you, what the hell! I’m a regular employee of Mobius…”

  I sat in the driver’s seat.
 </p>
 <p>
  I gripped the steering wheel and pressed the accelerator.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, you crazy bastard! What are you doing?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Vroom!
 </p>
 <p>
  The powerful engine sound roared as the sports car sped forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  I kept accelerating, smashing through obstacles in my way.
 </p>
 <p>
  The luxury sports car’s front end was battered, but that wasn’t my concern.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took out the communication stone with my left hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s Han. How’s it going?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oppa Velkist says he won’t forgive you.”

  “That’s terrifying.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anyway, there are three of us left now. But can you really make it? Battle Royale matches take a long time…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Focus on your match. If you can’t win even after all of this hassle, you know what happens. It’s over.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh… I’ll concentrate.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good, I’m hanging up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ptooey.
 </p>
 <p>
  I spat out the blood pooling in my mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  My entire body was covered in wounds. The combined result of minor injuries and the aftermath of Ascend.
 </p>
 <p>
  Vroom!
 </p>
 <p>
  The dashboard indicated a speed of 200 km/h.

 <p>
  A curve. I twisted the steering wheel and hit the brakes. Screech! The smell of burning tires filled the air as thick skid marks were drawn on the road.
 </p>
 <p>
  11:53 AM.
 </p>
 <p>
  7 minutes left.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the distance, the silhouette of the stadium was visible.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you see that crazy thief bastard! You’re screwed if you get caught!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The sound of a propeller.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking up, a helicopter was following.
 </p>
 <p>
  I extended my middle finger towards the helicopter.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, without hesitation, I pressed the accelerator.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sports car smashed through a steel fence three times,

  “Damn! My limited-edition Lamborghini…”
 </p>
 <p>
  11:57 AM.
 </p>
 <p>
  I arrived at the parking lot in front of the stadium.
 </p>
 <p>
  Screech! I maneuvered around the buses blocking the front and drove up to the entrance of the stadium.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seems like it’s coming this way…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  I honked the horn and pushed forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What, what! Why are you coming here!”

  “Ah, get out of the way!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  The sports car smashed through the glass doors of the entrance and came to a stop inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flames and smoke rose from the front of the car.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Ah, I’m gonna die.’
 </p>
 <p>
  There wasn’t a spot on my body that didn’t ache.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud. I stepped out of the mangled car door.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I locked eyes with an employee wearing a badge.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m a participant in the individual match. Came here for the finals.”

  “Uh, you can go that way.”

 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  The sports car embedded in the wall exploded.
 </p>
 <p>
  I pointed behind me and said,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Take care of that, will you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, yes… I’ll call the fire department…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I moved towards the corridor indicated by the employee.
 </p>
 <p>
  Limping on one leg, I took out a second potion from my bag and drank it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is there a participant named Velkist from Townia? If you don’t come out now, you’ll be disqualified!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The referee on the square stage was calling the next contestant.

 <p>
  Velkist, was it his first match?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’m sorry dude. He must have been looking forward to it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I smirked and approached the stage.
 </p>
 <p>
  The opponent had already taken the stage.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did he run away? Waiting is annoying. Just disqualify him already.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood. Then we’ll proceed with a walkover.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t talk nonsense.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I stepped onto the stairs and climbed onto the stage.
 </p>
 <p>
  The audience in the stands focused their attention on me. Among them, Aaron was also present, his eyes widening in apparent joy.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who is this? You seem to be severely injured.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Substitute.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A substitute? There’s no such rule.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A female employee ran up to the stage and whispered in the referee’s ear.
 </p>
 <p>
  The referee’s expression changed moment by moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  The referee looked at me with a horrified expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you Han Israt from Townia, the winner of the Battle Royale?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……Participation acknowledged.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What? Participating twice! Was there such a ridiculous rule!”

  My opponent,
 </p>
 <p>
  The burly man with an axe turned red in the face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Almost all three events are held simultaneously, so we didn’t think this would happen. We will revise the rules to make duplicate participation impossible next time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ve lost your mind. Whatever, fine! I’ll split your head open.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The burly man spat on his hand and slammed his axe into the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your body is covered in blood. Seems like you barely survived death. Do you think you can win?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bloodied.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not an inaccurate description.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even I, couldn’t walk out safe against several born 4 stars heroes.
 </p>
 <p>
  And with the aftereffects of Ascend on top.

 <p>
  Drip.
 </p>
 <p>
  Blood dripping from my forehead fell to the floor of the arena.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where did you throw your weapon? Planning to fight bare-handed?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I hadn’t brought my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  The staff member was fussing around looking for keys or something.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Whether you’re a substitute or a blockhead, you’ve come here to die! I’ve been craving some bloodshed. Hahaha!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The scoundrel laughed sinisterly.
 </p>
 <p>
  I calmed my breath.
 </p>
 <p>
  No time for a break, is that it?
 </p>
 <p>
  I have to make it to the finals.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is interesting.
 </p>
 <p>
  A suitable penalty.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I might as well use my fists…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I stretched out my right hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thump!
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, Bifrost, having pierced through the ceiling, crashed onto the stage floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  I grabbed its hilt and drew the sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Peep!
 </p>
 <p>
  The referee blew the whistle.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron in the audience stood up and shouted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hyung-nim! Hang in there!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I smirked and flipped the blade.

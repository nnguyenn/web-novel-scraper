  Aaron’s quarterfinal match had just concluded.
 </p>
 <p>
  His opponent was a rare class, a Magic Swordsman, blending magic with swordsmanship which gave Aaron a hard time. After a grueling 20 minutes of combat, Aaron emerged victoriously, albeit with his body marked by numerous wounds. The audience, bored by the lengthy battle, yawned throughout.

 <p>
  Next was Vanil’s match.
 </p>
 <p>
  The entire stadium roared with cheers. Vanil, responding to the crowd’s enthusiasm, wielded his rapier, striking his opponent’s vital points with butterfly-like steps and dazzling hand movements.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon after, the results of Group B, which I was part of, were announced.
 </p>
 <p>
  Naturally, I advanced to the next round. This time, the match lasted about 3 minutes.
 </p>
 <p>
  After the quarterfinals, the contestants were given a short break to prepare for the semifinals and the finals.

 <p>
  Niflheimr’s fans installed safety devices between the stands and the stage and brought in a professional commentator.
 </p>
 <p>
  The stadium was nearly full. After the semifinals and finals, there would be an award ceremony and the closing ceremony. It seemed that all the heroes from the dimensional city had gathered.
 </p>
 <p>
  The order of the matches was decided by spinning a roulette.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a result, I was the first in the semifinals. My opponent was a four-star Elementalist with a fire attribute, which made me laugh since I had faced this type too often.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Elementalist was beaten into a pulp within a minute.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, only Aaron and Vanil’s match remained.

 <p>
  Three heroes remained in the waiting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because the wounds opened up during the semifinals I was wrapping my hands again with bandages while looking around.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron sat on a bench in the corner, his expression unreadable. In contrast, Vanil appeared relaxed, practicing his sword swings.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The semifinal Group A match will now begin! The winner of this match will face another contestant in the finals. What will the outcome be? Both contestants, please come to the stage!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The broadcast announced.
 </p>
 <p>
  Vanil sheathed his sword and left the waiting room without hesitation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron and I locked eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  I opened my mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Win.”

 <p>
  “At all costs… you mean?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron clenched his lips tightly and looked back at me before slowly leaving the waiting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if memories fade, the body remembers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, he still only knew intermediate spear techniques.
 </p>
 <p>
  I also grabbed my sheath and left the waiting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You, the contestant, should wait in the…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who cares? It’s the last one anyway. I’m just going to watch from the stands.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I pushed past the staff blocking my way and walked down the corridor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron’s figure receded in the distance.

 <p>
  ‘Should I drink it now?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I took a potion out of my belt.
 </p>
 <p>
  A brilliant red one. Jenna had secretly entered the waiting room and handed it to me. It was a top-quality potion made by Anytng for moments like this. Drinking it would restore my original condition for about an hour.
 </p>
 <p>
  I should be able to hold out until the finals.
 </p>
 <p>
  I downed the potion in one gulp and stepped into the arena.
 </p>
 <p>
  I moved stealthily between the spectator seats and the stage. Vanil and Aaron were already climbing onto the caged stage.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though they were both from Niflheimr, the atmosphere was starkly different.
 </p>
 <p>
  Vanil, whose uniform was spotless, contrasted sharply with Aaron, whose clothing was torn from fierce battles.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who do you think will win, commentators?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, it’s obviously Vanil. From what I’ve gathered, he has never lost in Niflheimr’s training programs.”

  [Tazza11: F*cking! Win!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hou38: Not expecting much. Just drain his stamina.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Even the onlookers joined in.
 </p>
 <p>
  I found a secluded spot and sat down.
 </p>
 <p>
  The two heroes faced each other from opposite sides of the square stage.
 </p>
 <p>
  I ignored everyone and listened to the two of them in the square.

  “Of course. I’ve worked hard too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You just had a good draw. You shouldn’t have come to this event. You’re going to tarnish Lord Loki’s reputation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Vanil drew his spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t his primary weapon. Aaron also took out his spear in response.
 </p>
 <p>
  Peep!
 </p>
 <p>
  The whistle blew, and Vanil quickly lunged forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  His lightning-fast thrust aimed at Aaron’s entire body. Aaron calmly rotated his spear to block the attack. Vanil held the spear shaft shorter, and this time, his slashing attack stormed from all directions around Aaron.
 </p>
 <p>
  Speed, weight, posture.
 </p>
 <p>
  From thrusting to slashing, from slashing to pulling, and back to thrusting.

 <p>
  Vanil connected these three basic movements to pressure Aaron.
 </p>
 <p>
  For now, Aaron calmly defended against them.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shall we move on to the next?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Vanil held the spear longer.
 </p>
 <p>
  The shaft vibrated and bent as the thrust shot forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  Multiple shadows of the spear tip scattered.
 </p>
 <p>
  These were not basic movements.
 </p>
 <p>
  Softness (유), swiftness (쾌), illusion (환).
 </p>
 <p>
  Techniques Aaron could never mimic.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……!”

 <p>
  The spear tip grazed Aaron’s shoulder, bursting the bandaged wound open, and blood spurted out.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve heard your story. You spent 57 years there.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But you’re not him. He’s special. You’re not someone who can follow him.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Vanil’s fierce attack continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  Various spectacular techniques unfolded from his fingertips.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You can’t beat me even with a spear. Talent is such. Even if you train for a million years……”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……Shut up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron’s face contorted.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, his hurled spear was effortlessly blocked.
 </p>
 <p>
  Vanil smirked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s textbook-clean. But that’s all.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you came to fight, then fight. Why……”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m giving you some advice. You’re also a Niflheimr affiliate. Your path isn’t here. Give up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ping!
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron’s fingertips shot the spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Vanil slightly moved his head to dodge.
 </p>
 <p>
  As if he saw it all coming.
 </p>
 <p>
  “He’s just playing with him. I don’t need to see more.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hurry up and finish this. I want to see the fight with the Mad Dog in the finals.”

  “Still, it’s fun to watch! The spear moves so swiftly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He’s just dodging everything!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The spectators murmured.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sighed. Aaron relentlessly thrust, but Vanil evaded all with light movements.
 </p>
 <p>
  That was his domain.
 </p>
 <p>
  To break through one domain, one must acquire similar capabilities.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Couldn’t he even learn that?’
 </p>
 <p>
  A skill essential to mastering intermediate weapon techniques, yet it seemed he had failed to master even that. He had forced himself beyond an originally impossible realm.
 </p>
 <p>
  His movements became devoid of unnecessary motions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, they sharpened and became more precise.

 <p>
  But that was all.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s your 57 years.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Vanil spun his spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron’s spear attack didn’t even touch Vanil’s coat.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘……Win.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I told Aaron.
 </p>
 <p>
  You can’t win with just technique.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it were all about technique, Ridigion would have been the strongest.
 </p>
 <p>
  Surpass that level.
 </p>
 <p>
  Otherwise, you can’t reach where I am.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kuh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron staggered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Vanil’s spear blade deeply gouged his side.
 </p>
 <p>
  Blood seeped through his uniform.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Surrender. I don’t want to hurt a compatriot.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Be quiet……”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmph.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Vanil scoffed and rotated his spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll make you understand your place.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Countless spear strikes were launched at Aaron.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron swung his spear to defend his vitals, retreating step by step.
 </p>
 <p>
  Until he reached the edge of the square stage.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now sleep!”

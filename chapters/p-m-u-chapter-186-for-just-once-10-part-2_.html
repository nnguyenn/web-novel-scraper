 <p>
  Countless spear strikes were launched at Aaron.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron swung his spear to defend his vitals, retreating step by step.

 <p>
  Until he reached the edge of the square stage.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now sleep!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Vanil gripped his spear and charged.
 </p>
 <p>
  10 minutes later.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……It’s not even fun anymore.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Vanil furrowed his brow.
 </p>
 <p>
  30 minutes into the match.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron’s uniform was in tatters, and his body was covered in wounds.
 </p>
 <p>
  Blood that dripped down seeped into the cracks on the floor, forming pools.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, Aaron had not fallen.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why won’t you finish it? It’s getting boring.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, hurry up and finish it! We want to see the finals!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Vanil tightened his grip on the spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I admit your tenacity. I didn’t want to kill you, but…… it can’t be helped.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The spear tip aimed at Aaron’s heart.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘You didn’t want to kill him?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Second Coming of the Demon Sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  I don’t know who gave him that nickname.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Stupid.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I snickered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Vanil stomped the ground. The spinning spear blade burrowed towards Aaron’s heart.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron spat out what he had been holding in his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bright red blood sprayed across Vanil’s face, and he flinched. However, he quickly recovered his stance and continued his attack. But his aim was slightly off.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thunk.
 </p>
 <p>
  The spear blade pierced right next to Aaron’s heart.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Vanil tried to withdraw his spear, Aaron gripped the spear shaft.
 </p>
 <p>
  That was the end.

 </div>
 <p>
  “Uh……”
 </p>
 <p>
  Vanil coughed up blood and collapsed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The was a hole between his brows.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Isn’t he a fool?’
 </p>
 <p>
  If you really wanted to win, you should have brought out your sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, not wanting to kill? That weak heart stance created an opening.
 </p>
 <p>
  While he undoubtedly had talent, it seemed he lacked real combat experience. If he had undergone proper combat training, he wouldn’t have entertained such thoughts.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I… I’ve won…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron’s words faltered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just before he collapsed, he propped himself up with the spear.

 <p>
  Breath rushed from his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, Aaron has won!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The judge, who had been dumbly watching, raised his flag.
 </p>
 <p>
  Simultaneously, boos rained down.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What kind of match was that!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why is the level of the fight so low?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He won by luck after being beaten up, what kind of game is that!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The second coming of the Demon Sword? I was tricked by such a title. Oh my.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The audience was undoubtedly unamused.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clearly, Aaron was lacking.
 </p>

 <p>
  Moreover, the last reversal occurred after he spat the blood he had been holding in his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  The fierce and splendid battle the audience desired was far from what transpired.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aaron, the final will start in 10 minutes. Please return to the waiting room…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron did not respond to the referee’s instruction.
 </p>
 <p>
  He just staggered, standing on the stage.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  His blood-soaked eyes turned towards me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I walked onto the stage, smiling.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Referee!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes?”
 </p>

  “Let’s start the final match now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you mean? The rules are clearly established…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This guy’s already done for. If he goes back to the waiting room, he won’t be able to stand up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He was barely holding himself upright.
 </p>
 <p>
  The moment he took a step, he would fall.
 </p>
 <p>
  And likely never get up again.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you want to tart the final now, that’s fine with me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That is… if both parties agree…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The referee looked towards Aaron.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron gave a slight nod.
 </p>

 <p>
  “He agrees.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The referee hurried off the stage, probably to report to the higher-ups.
 </p>
 <p>
  The decision would soon be announced.
 </p>
 <p>
  The audience’s booing continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……Hyung-nim.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron was looking at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I, I won.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good job. I knew you would.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron glanced aside.

 <p>
  Vanil’s body was dissipating into light.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I, I remember…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Staggering, he leaned on his spear,
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron murmured.
 </p>
 <p>
  “57 years… it wasn’t 57 years…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I am… why…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Drip.
 </p>
 <p>
  Blood streamed from Aaron’s eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I tried so hard… and it all meant nothing…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I wanted to win fairly… with my real skill.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron wiped his eyes with his sleeve.
 </p>
 <p>
  Blood-mixed tears fell to the floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It was all meaningless, wasn’t it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It could be.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What was I fighting for…”
 </p>
 <p>
  A sob mixed into Aaron’s voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Ladies and gentlemen, a sudden announcement has been made. Based on the consent of both contestants, the final will start immediately! We apologize for any inconvenience. We…&gt;

  ‘Show me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Peep.
 </p>
 <p>
  The referee, having returned to the arena, blew his whistle.

 <p>
  The main event of the third major competition.
 </p>
 <p>
  The individual finals had begun.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Crazy dog! Cut that bastard into pieces!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Looks like he’s about to die anyway.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Demon Sword and the Mad Dog should’ve clashed in the finals! Not this weakling!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Booooo!
 </p>
 <p>
  The audience continued to jeer.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;He doesn’t look in good shape.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Even if he drank a healing potion, it wouldn’t have helped. He thinks it’s better to end it on stage rather than forfeit.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  I stepped forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tazza11: F$ck!!! jhwaemuraengnlinri!! My bet!!!!!! Aaaahhh!!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hou38: Lol, easy money. Totally honey-butter tier! Agree? Agree!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tazza11: Kill him! Kill him!!!]
 </p>
 <p>
  How noisy.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are too many low-level spectators.
 </p>
 <p>
  I loosely gripped my sword and took another step forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron stood motionless in place.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course. Just standing there must be hard for him. It wouldn’t be surprising if he was already dead.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… Urgh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron groaned heavily.
 </p>

 <p>
  Barely using his spear as a staff to support himself,
 </p>
 <p>
  His arms and legs trembled incessantly, and sticky blood dripped from his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you resent me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…No, Hyung-nim.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t lie. I know everything.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I sneered.
 </p>
 <p>
  If I hadn’t persuaded him, Aaron wouldn’t have to endure this pain.
 </p>
 <p>
  He would have lived comfortably as a trainer in Townia. Though he once struggled with being behind others, if I didn’t run my mouth, now he would be content with his life like Dika.
 </p>
 <p>
  I knew.
 </p>
 <p>
  What kind of end did the heroes who went there with high hopes meet.

 <p>
  What despair and loneliness they faced,
 </p>
 <p>
  I could see it clearly as a Master.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even knowing that, I persuaded him. I made Aaron like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were countless challengers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Those who laughed through grueling training, who didn’t blink an eye at anything, who wanted to sell their soul to become stronger.
 </p>
 <p>
  They easily lasted a year.
 </p>
 <p>
  Many lasted ten years without difficulty.
 </p>
 <p>
  But when it went beyond a hundred years…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s easier said than done.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The moment they realized they had no achievements in all those years.
 </p>

 <p>
  The moment they realized that there were others who negated their hard work in just a few months.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aaron.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Give up. You have no talent.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I let my sword hang down.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Return to Townia. I’ll give you the trainer’s position. Live comfortably there.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your path is a thorny one. There’s nothing there. If you choose it, you’ll never change until you die. You’ll live in pain all your life.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron wavered.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took a step closer to him.
 </p>

  “What’s the point of becoming stronger? To show off to others? To act superior? Don’t seek what is beyond your capabilities. Everyone has a suitable place.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you do your job, you’ll naturally rise up with us. I’ll save your sister too. You can go back home. You don’t have to dirty your hands.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron’s lips moved, but only blood-mixed saliva flowed out.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just nod your head. I’ll make it easy for you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked ahead.
 </p>
 <p>
  Above the audience, near the ceiling, a boy sat by the ventilation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Wearing a pressed-down hat, the boy looked down at Aaron on stage.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Answer me, Aaron.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I said.

  Aaron’s lips moved again.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…No.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What? I can’t hear you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No… Hyung-nim…”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is that your answer.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled faintly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then I aimed my sword at him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment, I realized Aaron had lost consciousness.
 </p>
 <p>
  He still stood upright, but his eyes had already lost their light.

 <p>
  My figure, reflected in his eyes, pointed the sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let me show you.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I scraped the floor with my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh! Blue flames sparkled brilliantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★★★★)’ has entered Ascend state!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack!
 </p>
 <p>
  The marble tiles tore apart like tofu.
 </p>
 <p>
  The swirling flames burned fiercely to the end of the stage.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  I stepped forward strongly.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-12" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  The ground caved in, and spiderweb-like cracks spread in all directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Maximum output.
 </p>
 <p>
  No holding back.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite top-grade potions, wounds opened, and blood burst from my body.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack. Muscles tore, bones broke, and the sound echoed in my ears.
 </p>
 <p>
  Time slowed.
 </p>
 <p>
  1/100 of a second. 1/1000 of a second.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron’s eyes still lacked light.
 </p>
 <p>
  Toward the half dead Aaron,
 </p>
 <p>
  A great sword enveloped in blue flames swung down.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Skill, ‘Soulblade Fusion’ activated!]
 </p>
 <p>
  You and I started from different points.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though both are 1-star we were incomparable.
 </p>
 <p>
  I mastered all the strategies of this world, had talent, willpower, and even an invincible force behind me. But you…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘You had nothing.’
 </p>
 <p>
  At first, you cried at the back, unable to fight.
 </p>
 <p>
  Later, you tried desperately, but even that didn’t work out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Space itself was being torn apart.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flames devoured everything they touched, burning fiercely.

  Just before the flames engulfed Aaron.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  He moved.
 </p>
 <p>
  Grasping the spear with his blood-soaked hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Empty eyes reignited.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hundreds of shadows appeared on the stage.
 </p>
 <p>
  The shadows, each in a different stance, wielded spears like Aaron. But it was a fleeting moment. The illusion that filled the stadium returned to Aaron’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘……’
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron thrust his spear.
 </p>

 <p>
  Thousands of shadows appeared near the spear blade.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not thousands.
 </p>
 <p>
  I widened my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Tens of thousands.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoom.
 </p>
 <p>
  The shadows, like bees’ wings, surrounding the spear blade soon merged with it.
 </p>
 <p>
  I knew it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Condensing tens of millions of thrusts into a single one…
 </p>
 <p>
  Myuden’s secret technique, a deadly spear art.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Did he perfect it?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!

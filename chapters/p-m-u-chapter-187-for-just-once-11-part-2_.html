 <p>
  I knew it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Condensing tens of millions of thrusts into a single one…

 <p>
  Myuden’s secret technique, a deadly spear art.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Did he perfect it?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  The blue flash swept Aaron.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Ha.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I exhaled deeply.
 </p>
 <p>
  The duel was over. The verdict was made with a single exchange.
 </p>
 <p>
  The dust that had risen in the stadium cleared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon, the desolate stage scenery was revealed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ground was dug out entirely.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  A gigantic signboard split in two fell to the front of the stage.
 </p>
 <p>
  The spectators fell silent for a moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the area in front of me had been the audience seats, dozens would have died easily.
 </p>
 <p>
  Cough.
 </p>
 <p>
  I spat out a mouthful of blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  I wiped it roughly with my sleeve and shook it off.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Maximum output.’
 </p>

 <p>
  I used all my strength without any reservation.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the opponent had the strength to swing the spear even once, it was my defeat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What… what just happened?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “One slash… ended it all?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked ahead.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron stood in the posture of thrusting his spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ground where he stood was unscathed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Only from beside him was it dug out in a V shape.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Soulblade Fusion…’
 </p>
 <p>
  I laughed in disbelief.

 <p>
  Ping!
 </p>
 <p>
  Belatedly, the sound of wind reached, and the skin on my neck tore.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crunch.
 </p>
 <p>
  A hole was pierced in the middle of the Bifrost sword blade.
 </p>
 <p>
  Snap.
 </p>
 <p>
  Snap snap.
 </p>
 <p>
  Cracks spread from the hole.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ka-ching.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Bifrost split in two, fell to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This guy…’

 <p>
  How did this happen?
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;What just happened?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;It seems one of the players used a special skill. Amazing. It’s hard to believe he’s a 4-star. His weapon couldn’t withstand the power of the technique.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tazza11: Wow… crazy strong;]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hou38: Told you to bet on him. He’s beyond the 4-star level.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Restio0: Master, buy him a new weapon. How strong must he be for the sword to break?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Impressive, you mad dog! Glad I bet on you!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “At this level, even the true Sword Demon would be pulverized.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Tsk tsk, looks like he intentionally missed. If he hit, there’d be no corpse left.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Couldn’t withstand?

  This Bifrost, couldn’t withstand the backlash of Sword Soul?
 </p>
 <p>
  What nonsense.
 </p>
 <p>
  I laughed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  I raised my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  The upper part of the blade was gone, leaving a broken hole.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Ridiculous.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I barely held my collapsing body.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s not over yet. The finish remains.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”

 <p>
  Aaron remained motionless in the posture of thrusting his spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  His eyes extinguished. He used all his strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just once. The maximum effort Aaron could muster.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m speechless.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I approached Aaron with the broken sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You have to do it in restraint, man. If you do it like this, you will interfere with the missions.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What will you do about this? Pay up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron didn’t respond.
 </p>
 <p>
  He stared blankly at where I was.

 <p>
  ‘He’s dead.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Standing up.
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled.
 </p>
 <p>
  He doesn’t know.
 </p>
 <p>
  When you wake up, you won’t know what happened and what you did.
 </p>
 <p>
  I won’t tell you. Until you figure it out yourself.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now I understand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Why Niflheimr participated in this event, abandoning the World Raid.
 </p>
 <p>
  A 5-star summon ticket and the offering experience to other trainees were trivial issues.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I struck gold.’

 <p>
  I looked up again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Myuden, sitting in the ventilation, had a broad smile on his face.
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s no turning back now.
 </p>
 <p>
  The time Aaron spent must have been unimaginable hell.
 </p>
 <p>
  It will be the same in the future.
 </p>
 <p>
  As I said, your pain will not disappear.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But don’t worry.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The ability you awakened is not a mere thrust.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s not a slash, a thrust, or a swing. Not physical or magical, non-attribute or piercing.
 </p>
 <p>
  No genius, even ten Ridgion, could imitate it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Karma.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the thousands of skills and imprints in Pick Me Up, the only unique attribute.
 </p>
 <p>
  With that alone, Myuden rose to a near-invincible position.
 </p>
 <p>
  I raised the broken sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  In front of me stood someone who had surpassed a wall humans couldn’t overcome.
 </p>
 <p>
  A monster who spent thousands, tens of thousands, tens of millions of nights in training.
 </p>
 <p>
  A genius is someone who taught one thing and mastered ten.
 </p>
 <p>
  But even that genius could not surpass a predetermined limit.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as a lion, though the king of beasts, cannot surpass the limits of its species.
 </p>
 <p>
  This guy was once a rabbit.
 </p>

 <p>
  But now, he is no longer a rabbit.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nor was he a lion.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had become something different, beyond recognition.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Aaron.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The guy I once knew is no more.
 </p>
 <p>
  When you return to Townia…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Farewell.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I lowered the broken sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud.

 <p>
  The sound of Aaron falling echoed.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment, a shadow appeared from nowhere and retrieved Aaron’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  I smirked and sheathed the broken sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wouldn’t go in.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha, Han! Cough!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The referee, buried in rock debris, stood up.
 </p>
 <p>
  His neat suit was now a rag.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Victory! Congratulations… on your win.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As I passed by, I patted his shoulder, causing him to collapse.
 </p>
 <p>
  What professionalism.
 </p>
 <p>
  I walked towards the corridor.
 </p>
 <p>
  A few staff members stopped me, saying we had to do the award ceremony, but it wasn’t going to happen in this state.
 </p>
 <p>
  I pushed them away and headed to the waiting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Master, congratulations on your victory.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  As if she had been waiting Yurnet’s voice tickled my ears.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Take it easy, will you? I almost lost. If that guy was in his right mind, I’d be the one dead.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Hehe, I believed you would overcome it. Because you’re the master.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Enough. More importantly… Bifrost broke.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Due to the Karma attribute, natural recovery is impossible. I’ll retrieve it and have it repaired.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thanks for that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I leaned against the corridor wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sky was yellow.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What about Aaron…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Myuden will not let him go easily.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “I guess so.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He must have been lonely.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, it’s something for later.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Give him my congratulations.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;As you command.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  I ended the communication.
 </p>
 <p>
  I heard footsteps from far down the corridor.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……Too late.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I leaned against the wall and closed my eyes.

 <p>
  I opened my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  The striped pattern on the ceiling came into view.
 </p>

 <p>
  It seemed like a private hotel room. However, it wasn’t the room I had been in.
 </p>
 <p>
  A king-sized bed with pristine white luxury sheets. Lavish wooden furniture was placed around the room.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Good grief.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I got up from the bed.
 </p>
 <p>
  There wasn’t any pain. The aftereffects of Ascend were completely gone.
 </p>
 <p>
  My body seemed to have returned to normal.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re awake?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As I was yawning, a woman in uniform entered the room.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was Yurnet.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well,
 </p>
 <p>
  there was no way she wouldn’t appear here.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ve been sleeping all day. I thought you were dead.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You were here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, even before Master arrived.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet smiled and handed me a glass of water.
 </p>
 <p>
  I drank it down in one go.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What happened with the event?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “After the Master collapsed, the closing ceremony was held. Since then, a day has passed, so everyone has returned to their original waiting rooms. The only ones left here are our Niflheimr and your Townia.”
 </p>

 <p>
  I looked out the window.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sun was caught halfway up a building.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the distance, a wave of light was engulfing the city.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The dimensional city will disappear by today. If we leave late, we’ll get swept away too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That makes sense.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve prepared breakfast. Would you like to eat?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m not hungry.”
 </p>
 <p>
  My armor and coat were hanging on a hook next to the bed.
 </p>
 <p>
  After putting on my outfit, I picked up the scabbard lying beneath it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kaak.

 <p>
  With a scraping sound, the blade of Bifrost was drawn and broken in half.
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally, I could grasp the reality of what happened with Aaron.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It was a splendid duel. Even Ridigion couldn’t stop admiring it. He’s looking forward to when you become a six-star.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master, you’re truly remarkable. To win two championships. Both Earth and Mobius are buzzing with your story. This event has made even the rankers pay attention to you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s annoying.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t want unnecessary attention.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, I was the one who gave them a reason. Even if I could have gotten through with Ascend, I couldn’t hide the power of the Soulblade Fusion. Any Master with a keen eye would grasp the significance of the technique I used.
 </p>
 <p>
  After all, I broke through the protective barrier set up outside the stage.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I didn’t want to be noticed…’
 </p>

 <p>
  But there was no way around it without using the Soulblade Fusion.
 </p>
 <p>
  No regrets. It was something that would happen eventually anyway.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Like I mentioned yesterday, please get this repaired.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Leave it to me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I tossed the sword to Yurnet.
 </p>
 <p>
  A space next to Yurnet opened up and swallowed the sword. Although Bifrost has a self-repair function, the technique used was beyond its capability.
 </p>
 <p>
  I left the bedroom and headed to the living room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Judging by the outside view, we were on the top floor of the hotel. Waves of light were swallowing traffic lights, roads, and various buildings.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aaron?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He’s in the next room. Should I bring him?”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Leave him be.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ve said everything I needed to.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I meet that guy again, it’ll be in Townia.
 </p>
 <p>
  By then, Aaron will likely be very different from the one I knew.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As I was preparing to leave the room, Yurnet spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Myuden suggested that Aaron defect.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not just a suggestion; he seems quite adamant about it. He’s even throwing a tantrum, saying he won’t let him go, even if he has to cut off his legs. What will you do?”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Tell him to knock it off.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Pardon me, but I also agree with the suggestion.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned to look at her.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet had her eyes closed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “One of Niflheim’s 13th-floor seats might soon become vacant.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you mean?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Myuden has lived too long. Longer than we can imagine.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Here we go again with the strange talk.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you trying to stop him from coming back?”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Not exactly. We’ll have to send him at the right time. It’s about what happens after that. After the matter with Townia is settled. If he doesn’t choose to return to his original world… it’s worth considering.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you think Niflheimr will still be around then?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course. We’re quite fond of the Master and this world. If possible, we’d like to stay until we grow old and die.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet smiled at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Until she grows old and dies, she says.
 </p>
 <p>
  What a joke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Lend me a sword. I don’t have one to use while this is being repaired.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Take the one by the entrance.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A sword identical to Bifrost was in the umbrella stand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Checking the item, it was of A-grade. Good enough as a spare while the original is repaired.

 <p>
  I attached the scabbard to my belt.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They are waiting.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Yeah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled and left the entrance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Returning to my original room on the 8th floor of the hotel, I found all four members waiting for me.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to Jenna, shortly after I went missing, Niflheimr’s staff contacted them saying I was being treated.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s amazing. It didn’t seem like a wound that would heal in a day.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We need to leave here. We can have the after-party in the waiting room. They said the dimensional city will disappear soon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sure. Is everyone packed? Sister Radi said she has the airship waiting right out front.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Everyone left the room, chattering.
 </p>
 <p>
  The heroes who had filled the corridor were no longer in sight.
 </p>
 <p>
  After the closing ceremony, they had been forced to disband.
 </p>
 <p>
  “By the way, are you even human? I saw the Battle Royale video. You were beating everyone up. And then, with that body, you went to the individual competition and won.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right. Unlike someone who was struggling with poison.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, sis did great too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna and Edis were chatting as they walked ahead.
 </p>
 <p>
  Behind them, Kishasha was chewing on jerky, and at the very back, Velkist was walking with a sour expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled.

  “Are you that upset about not participating in the individual competition?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not particularly. It’s just a shame that my eyes were playing tricks on me. To win, it was right for you to go. If I had gone…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist squinted.
 </p>
 <p>
  As if recalling that time.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I want to ask one thing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Go ahead.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you sure your Soulblade Fusion was pierced by that technique?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m glad that was all.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist smirked and closed his mouth.

 <p>
  He has sharp eyes as expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist seemed to have grasped a little of Aaron’s technique.

 <p>
  After returning from the event site, we were given a few days of rest.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since we obtained the key materials from the event, Anytng would have needed some time.

 <p>
  Anytng was preparing to expand the waiting room and construct a new airship. A hangar facility was created next to the dimensional rift, where production workers, led by a mechanic, were building the frame of the airship.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had other things to do.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though it was supposed to be a break, there were things that could no longer be postponed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Engraving.
 </p>
 <p>
  A hero’s third ability, which could be awakened from 4-star, could be obtained from the Advent Dungeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  「…….」
 </p>
 <p>
  The item synthesis lab of the Magic Hall.
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio was chanting a spell with his eyes closed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Every time the magic power rose from Katiio’s body, the magic circle responded by shining brightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Oh! You! Light! Fall! Ah! On!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle was tap dancing beside him in a cheerleader outfit.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘……So noisy it’s killing me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Clicking my tongue, I moved my hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Starting item synthesis!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Selected materials – Intermediate Advent Stone, Dragon’s Blood, Sharp Black Dragon Scale, Heavenly Dew, Queen of the Forest’s Blood, Trace of the Dead, Prickly Mushroom, Dragon’s Eye]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Completed item – Unknown]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Success rate – Unknown]
 </p>

 <p>
  I placed the prepared materials into the magic pot.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Katiio waved his hand, a purple flash of light emerged from the pot.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was one of the reasons magicians were favored. Magicians are usually excellent enchanters. When placed in the synthesis lab, they receive significant bonuses for attribute imbuing and combining.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Please select puzzle difficulty. The higher the difficulty, the greater the rewards!]
 </p>
 <p>
  When I pressed the start synthesis button, a difficulty selection window appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  No need to think about it. I chose the bottommost hell difficulty.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Kyaah! As expected!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Be quiet. I need to concentrate.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Oh, okay.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if I did it roughly, there wouldn’t be much difference, but there was always that one chance.

  I started solving the puzzle that appeared on the screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  [★!Super Success!★]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★★★★)’ has created ‘Intermediate Advent Stone (Black Dragon Soul)’!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The completed item jumped out of the pot.
 </p>
 <p>
  I picked up the black glowing stone. The surface of the Advent Stone was covered with dragon scales.
 </p>
 <p>
  It didn’t look particularly good, but it meant success.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It came out well.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Given the high synthesis difficulty, it would have been hard without Katiio.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was glad I forced him to come. After putting the Advent Stone in my pocket, I spoke to the sweating Katiio.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good job. You were a big help.”

  “Whew…… I thought I was going to die. But, what are you doing? That thing you just made…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ll find out later.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After patting Katiio on the shoulder, I left the Magic Hall.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was 1:45 AM. Anytng had logged off, and except for a few heroes, everyone was asleep.
 </p>
 <p>
  I chose this time on purpose.
 </p>
 <p>
  It would be a pretty difficult scene to explain.
 </p>
 <p>
  I walked through the darkened square and headed to the second floor of the waiting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  To the place where the dimensional rift was located.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There won’t be any problems afterward, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Of course. I manipulated the logs perfectly. No one will suspect anything!]

 <p>
  Iselle followed me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I descended the stairs, touching the Advent Stone in my pocket.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It would be troublesome if the master found out.’
 </p>
 <p>
  What I was doing now would be the most suspicious incident among all the things I had done so far.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had taken some safety measures in advance, but it would be hard to avoid suspicion. All I could do was hope Anytng would let it slide. Because that’s the best scenario.
 </p>
 <p>
  [With Loki as the sub-master, passing authority has become easier. Soon, you might be able to do it without me.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “That would be great.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s bothersome to ask Iselle every time.
 </p>
 <p>
  I arrived at the second-floor plaza. The door to the dimensional rift was already wide open.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took out the Advent Stone from my pocket.
 </p>

 <p>
  To obtain the engraving, one must go through quite a complex process. First, you need the Advent Stone, which is not easy to acquire, and then you must clear the Advent Dungeon that the stone opens. Of course, if you die during the conquest, that’s the end.
 </p>
 <p>
  I moved the master’s control panel that Iselle handed over.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, opening the Advent Dungeon!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tips/ Advent Dungeon is a special stage that can be opened with special events or Advent Stones. You can engrave heroes there.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Done.
 </p>
 <p>
  I walked toward the dimensional rift.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle waved goodbye behind me.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Loki, don’t die! You must come back!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Clunk.

  When I entered the circular room, the door closed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Three large mirrors stood tall like tombstones.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each symbolizes the main dungeon, daily dungeon, and exploration dungeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  But now, there was one more addition here.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Prove your strength!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Advent Dungeon: Difficulty – ???]
 </p>
 <p>
  Advent Dungeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though it wasn’t considered one of the main missions, the difficulty could be even higher.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were numerous heroes who had died trying to get an engraving.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yurnet, are you ready?”
 </p>

 <p>
  I asked, bringing my hand to my ear.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;It’s done. It can be summoned anytime.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t make any mistakes. One misstep and it’s over.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Of course.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  A light laugh was heard.
 </p>
 <p>
  I approached the mirror inscribed with Advent Dungeon, holding the Intermediate Advent Stone.
 </p>
 <p>
  [※Caution!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you die in the Advent Dungeon, you cannot revive.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [There is a failure rate in engraving. Heroes who fail the engraving fall into a ‘contamination’ state.]
 </p>
 <p>
  I erased the system messages that appeared in my view.
 </p>
 <p>
  I already knew all this.
 </p>
 <p>
  [※Caution!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The higher the engraving grade, the harder the difficulty.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Choose an easy difficulty at first!]
 </p>
 <p>
  I put the Intermediate Advent Stone into the mirror.
 </p>
 <p>
  The surface of the mirror that swallowed the Advent Stone began to ripple black.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The conditions for opening the Advent Dungeon have been met.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Intermediate Descent Dungeon (Hall of the Black Dragon – Party Recommended) is open.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Entry in 10 seconds.]
 </p>
 <p>
  I exhaled.

 <p>
  Hall of the Black Dragon. It seems to have worked. If I had offered an attribute-less Advent Stone, the stage would have opened randomly, but by inserting a synthesized Advent Stone like this, I could enter the desired place.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now…
 </p>
 <p>
  All I had to do was win.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dum-dum!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Advent Dungeon is opening!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash.
 </p>
 <p>
  A black flash from the mirror engulfed me.
 </p>
 <p>
  When the light faded, I opened my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  A circular arena covered in sand.
 </p>
 <p>
  A man in a black cloak stood there.

  [Head of Halkion]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ricardo von Halgiraf Lv.???]
 </p>
 <p>
  The man’s eyes turned to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had seen this guy before. This place was also very familiar.
 </p>
 <p>
  We had fought here not too long ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was the field of the 20th-floor stage.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……Heh heh heh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The man laughed, covering his face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Being summoned here means…… you want to devour me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You know well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I drew my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Advent Dungeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here, heroes devour monsters and make their abilities their own.
 </p>
 <p>
  That was the engraving.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can’t rest even if I want to, huh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Same for me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The man laughed bitterly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It won’t be the same as last time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Black scales began to sprout from the man’s skin.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack. Giant arms and legs burst through his skin. His limbs twisted at odd angles, and his body swelled like a balloon.
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally, as the blood mist scattered, his form was revealed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Danger!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Black Dragon Halgiraf Lv.64]

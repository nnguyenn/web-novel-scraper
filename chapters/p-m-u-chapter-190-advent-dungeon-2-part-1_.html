  [Warning! Warning! Warning!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Black flames engulfed the entire sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom. Boom boom. Boom boom boom.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ground shook violently, and the walls of the arena crumbled.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flames surged through the gaps in the collapsed walls.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Who has summoned me?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  A rift in the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  The enormous eyes of a dragon were looking down at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Bingo.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I remembered what Neryssa had told me.
 </p>
 <p>
  The blood of the heads of the four great families of the last generation was so diluted, that they couldn’t harness the powers they were supposed to have.
 </p>
 <p>
  What I was trying to summon was one of the four ancient species that made a contract with the Emperor when the Empire was created. It was said to split the earth with a gesture and set mountains ablaze with a glance.
 </p>
 <p>
  [※Caution!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Current power level insufficient to clear this difficulty.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Retreat is recommended.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Numerous warning messages filled my vision.
 </p>
 <p>
  I waved the holograms away and exhaled.

 <p>
  The hot air filled my lungs. Just by its presence, the temperature had risen by several dozen degrees.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is more like it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled, looking up at the dragon.
 </p>
 <p>
  Its burning eyes were staring at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;A puny human. What do you want from me?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Give it to me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;What do you speak of?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your power.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The dragon’s pupils narrowed vertically.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Hehehehe… Hahahahaha!&gt;

 <p>
  Whooosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The wall of flames surged intensely.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Danger!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Primordial Black Dragon]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Halkion Syraos Lv.???]
 </p>
 <p>
  A man surrounded by black flames slowly descended to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  Three pairs of wings fluttered behind him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Holding a black spear and clad in jet-black armor, the man spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;So, you are the hero the goddess mentioned?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  He continued.

 <p>
  &lt;Your power is insignificant. It’s still insufficient. You cannot handle me. Go back.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “We won’t know until we try.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;You think you can understand?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The man smirked.
 </p>
 <p>
  Simultaneously.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I fell to my knees on the spot.
 </p>
 <p>
  An unbearable pressure, as if my body would be crushed. It felt like the blood in my veins was boiling backward.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Foolish. You really think you can handle this!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Barely supporting my collapsing body, I glanced to the side.
 </p>

 <p>
  Crack. The ground, unable to withstand the pressure, was cracking like a spider web.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was not psychological intimidation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gravity… perhaps.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Master, he is stronger than expected.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Is that so.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If Yurnet says he’s strong, then he really is.
 </p>
 <p>
  I grinned.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then I can’t let this slip away.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;But…&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Give me a hand. I don’t want to stay crouched.”

 <p>
  I heard Yurnet sigh.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Really… Master, you are incorrigible.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll take that as a compliment. This won’t take long.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;I’ll help you. Please win.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Bwoong.
 </p>
 <p>
  A dimensional gate opened above, and a double-edged sword covered in scales impaled the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  I grabbed the sword while still kneeling.
 </p>
 <p>
  The dragon-slaying sword Ascalon.
 </p>
 <p>
  A magical sword capable of dealing fixed damage to dragons.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the user had the dragon-slaying skill, the efficiency would be multiplied several times over.

  [Ascalon’s effect activated!]
 </p>
 <p>
  A white steel gauntlet fell from the dimensional gate.
 </p>
 <p>
  The gauntlet wriggled as if alive and attached itself to my right hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Draupnir’s effect activated!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Next was a small wooden box.
 </p>
 <p>
  Opening the lid revealed a crimson apple.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took a big bite out of the apple.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Idun’s Apple effect activated!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Numerous weapons began to fall from the dimensional gate.

 </p>
 <p>
  [Fragarach’s effect…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Meginjord’s effect…]
 </p>
 <p>
  This was my last chance.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had been saving them for this moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Ascend.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★★★★)’ has entered Ascend state!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Hundreds of kilograms of pressure were pressing down on me from all sides.
 </p>
 <p>
  I gritted my teeth. Clutching Ascalon, I firmly planted my feet on the ground and stood up.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Oh.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Oh, my foot!
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned the blade and charged at the creature watching me.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Skill, ‘Soulblade Fusion’ activated!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  The first strike.
 </p>
 <p>
  The full-powered Soulblade Fusion exploded against the black dragon.
 </p>
 <p>
  Amidst the flames, thick dust billowed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as my body was about to scream from the recoil damage, a cold sensation from my abdomen spread throughout my body. It was the effect of Idun’s Apple, which temporarily amplified healing ability by hundreds of times.

  [Skill, ‘Soulblade Fusion’ activated!]
 </p>
 <p>
  With strength unimaginable for my current self, I relentlessly unleashed Soulblade Fusion.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each swing of Ascalon released red lightning with dragon-slaying properties, and the damage from Ascend and Soulblade was continuously healed by Idun’s Apple.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though my body was healing, the pain did not disappear.
 </p>
 <p>
  I gritted my teeth to the point of breaking and swung the sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no time to rest. Between the dust, flames, and flying rocks, I could clearly see the creature standing there.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s too much.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even after using the weapons of Niflheimr, there was no guarantee of victory.
 </p>
 <p>
  Such a risky gamble. The old me would never have attempted this. I could have obtained a high-grade engraving later, after growing sufficiently.
 </p>
 <p>
  But…

 <p>
  ‘That’s not enough.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even now, when I close my eyes, it comes to mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  If I had been stronger back then, I wouldn’t have had to witness such a sight.
 </p>
 <p>
  I refuse to go through that again.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Heh, interesting. I can sense determination from you.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you understand, why don’t you die already? This is exhausting.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Then entertain me! Pass my test. I, Halkion Syraos, will personally confirm if you are worthy!&gt;

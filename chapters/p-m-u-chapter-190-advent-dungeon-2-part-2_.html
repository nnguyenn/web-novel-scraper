 <p>
  &lt;Heh, interesting. I can sense determination from you.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you understand, why don’t you die already? This is exhausting.”

 <p>
  &lt;Then entertain me! Pass my test. I, Halkion Syraos, will personally confirm if you are worthy!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  In a flash of light, the creature leapt.
 </p>
 <p>
  It fluttered its wings and aimed its spear at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let me ask you something.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;What is it?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is cheating allowed?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;If you pass, it doesn’t matter.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Great.”
 </p>
 <p>
  This bastard.
 </p>
 <p>
  He’s surpassing my expectations.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he was just of the highest difficulty, he should already be dead and lying around,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the limits of relying on such legendary equipment, it seems like a demon-level difficulty creature.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They called him a primordial something.’
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yurnet, open one more gate.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;As you command.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The second-dimensional gate behind me opened.
 </p>
 <p>
  This exhausted my third chance for weapon summoning.
 </p>

 <p>
  No regrets. This was the right time to use this power.
 </p>
 <p>
  I need to use everything at my disposal.
 </p>
 <p>
  I flicked my right hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom! Gungnir turned into lightning and struck the creature.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, one after another, weapons rained down like a storm.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Send all the equipment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Yes.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The equipment I wore were all top-tier, but as a low-level user, I couldn’t utilize even half of their efficiency. Still, there were so many that it somehow covered it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Haa.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Clad in top-tier items, I took a deep breath.
 </p>

 <p>
  The dragon was watching me. Despite striking it multiple times with the dragon-slaying Soulblade Fusion, its body remained unscathed. It had resistance to attributes as a bonus and dominance over special attributes.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is definitely a top-tier engraving.’
 </p>
 <p>
  That if I could pass this test.
 </p>
 <p>
  I spun Ascalon’s blade and kicked off the ground towards the creature floating in the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  And.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom.
 </p>
 <p>
  I threw the broken Ascalon aside.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then I collapsed to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  This bastard’s characteristic could be summed up in one word.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dirty durability. Even with all sorts of effects applied in the Ascend state, I couldn’t inflict any significant wounds. The only injury I caused was breaking one of its six wings.
 </p>

 <p>
  &lt;Is it over?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s over.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I answered briefly, spitting blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  All the weapons of Niflheimr were unsummoned. Some had exhausted their durability, while others had reached their time limit. The important thing was that I couldn’t inflict any significant damage on this creature. I could only blame myself as the user.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Certainly, this advent difficulty was top-tier…’
 </p>
 <p>
  No, this was no different from a hell-level.
 </p>
 <p>
  I clicked my tongue. Did I miscalculate? No matter how much I wanted to get stronger, I wasn’t foolish enough to challenge an unwinnable fight. If it was a top-tier advent monster, I could have easily won using item summoning.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If penetration doesn’t work, nor neutral or dragon-slaying attributes, then what is its weakness?’
 </p>
 <p>
  If I had a little more time, I might have found a strategy…
 </p>
 <p>
  But now it’s too late. Communication with Yurnet was no longer possible.

 <p>
  The man looked down at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  But his expression had slightly changed. Initially, he looked at me like an insect, but now he was looking at me with a smile, intrigued.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Is that really all?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Well, fine.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The man smiled and folded his wings.
 </p>
 <p>
  The flames enveloping his body, the pressure crushing me, and the black light coloring the sky all vanished.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;You pass the test.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “…?”

 <p>
  &lt;You knew the truth, yet you summoned me to gain power.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  What the hell is this guy talking about?
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;I glanced at your memory. You… came from somewhere else. And, I feel something strange in you. It’s very subtle. Very mysterious.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The man’s pupils narrowed vertically.
 </p>
 <p>
  A gaze that seemed to pierce through me.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Well I guess, it doesn’t matter.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;I dislike those guys anyway. Cowards who refuse to shoulder their burdens. Tsk, aren’t they all just cowards? You seem different, that’s why I like you.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The man threw something at the ground beneath me.
 </p>
 <p>
  A translucent orb.

 <p>
  Inside the palm-sized orb, black flames burned.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Take it.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The man glanced at me and then leaped into the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before long, his figure disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stage Clear!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have cleared the Intermediate Advent Dungeon.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have obtained the special engraving ‘True Black Dragon Blood (A)’. This engraving can be bestowed upon the hero who challenged the dungeon.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Eligible Hero – ‘Han (★★★★)’]
 </p>
 <p>
  The clear message appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can’t make sense of it.’
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  I stood still, gazing at the orb.
 </p>
 <p>
  [True Black Dragon Blood (A, Lv.1)]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proof of the pure bloodline of an ancient black dragon. It contains immense power.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Effect: All attribute defense +10%]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Unique Skill: Black Dragon Scale (duration 1 second)]
 </p>
 <p>
  An A-rank.
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering the commotion, the rank seemed low.
 </p>
 <p>
  The defense increase changed from physical and magical defense to all-attribute defense, but there didn’t seem to be any other special abilities. The unique skill also seemed unchanged.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Could it be…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Was I tricked?
 </p>
 <p>
  An A-rank engraving was quite high, but compared to the top-tier advent stone and weapon summoning I invested, it was an absurd exchange rate.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I shook my head.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’d have to use it to know for sure.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took out a magic silk cloth and wrapped the orb. Engraving it in an unfit state could lead to contamination. I planned to attempt the engraving after returning to the waiting room and making adjustments.
 </p>
 <p>
  Holding the wrapped orb, I walked through the exit that had appeared at the back of the field.
 </p>
 <p>
  [How was it, Loki? Huh? Huh?]
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as I stepped into the plaza, Iselle followed me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I handed the cloth-wrapped orb to Iselle.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Give it to me tomorrow evening. I’ll engrave it then.”
 </p>

 <p>
  [Okay! Let’s see, wow, it’s an A-rank! As expected of Loki. You’re amazing…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Chattering away, Iselle glanced at my expression and hesitantly spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Did something bad happen?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not really.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I frowned as I climbed the stairs to the next floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even after returning to the waiting room, the aftermath of the battle lingered, with my whole body aching and tingling.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Damn.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if it wasn’t an S-rank engraving, I could still become stronger depending on growth and combinations, but the result was definitely not satisfactory.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was far from a fair deal.
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering the investment.
 </p>

 <p>
  For my level and grade, this engraving was a blessing, but still.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It has synergy.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The damage immunity was a perfect match for Ascend and Soulblade Fusion.
 </p>
 <p>
  But I wanted something… stronger. After all that show, it was just an A-rank. What a stingy bastard.
 </p>
 <p>
  I decided to test the engraving starting tomorrow.

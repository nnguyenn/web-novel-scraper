  “Alright, Goo Goo Con.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Damn it! I’m Halkion Syraos, the primordial…&gt;

 <p>
  I moved my foot.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Call me whatever you want!!!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like we finally had an understanding.
 </p>
 <p>
  I slumped onto the straw heap and started asking the questions I was curious about.
 </p>
 <p>
  When it spouted nonsensical answers, I dunked its head in the barrel for a minute, and it obediently confessed the truth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, the Black Dragon Blood wasn’t in a complete state.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;…That’s right.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Goo Goo Con answered resignedly.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Unlike the other heroes I met, you had a distinct nature. I thought you could be more than just a borrower of power; you could be my vessel.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The test he mentioned must have meant something entirely different from what I thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So you pretended to go along and then betrayed me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Goo goo…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Goo Goo Con’s head drooped.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to its explanation, the Black Dragon Blood engraved on me was incomplete.
 </p>
 <p>
  To transfer his body, he removed the necessary elements for engraving and inserted a special magic.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why did you do that?”
 </p>

 <p>
  &lt;I was trapped there for tens of thousands of years. I wanted to get out. And then, you, a peculiar human, appeared before me. How could I not be tempted?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;I never want to go back.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Goo Goo Con shook its head several times.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;I know the situation you heroes are in. I know what happened to Townia, and what the goddess did. That woman accomplished something remarkable.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you talking about selling this place to another dimension?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Yes. It wasn’t easy.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Judging by its tone, it seemed to know the truth of this world inside out.
 </p>
 <p>
  No need for tedious explanations.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So… what use are you to me?”

  “Goo? Goo!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I grabbed Goo Goo Con by the neck and twisted it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Explain how you can be of help to me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Wa, wait!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t care if you’ve been there for thousands or tens of thousands of years. If I’m going to spare a backstabbing bastard like you, there better be a good reason. Are you planning to live here eating grain?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Guook!”
 </p>
 <p>
  When I let go, Goo Goo Con opened its beak.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;If I’m by your side… you can unleash the true power of the Black Dragon Blood!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really? Besides resistance, what else is there?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;The Black Dragon Blood isn’t just about resistance. It’s a blessing passed down from the beginning of time. It’s the providence and the dominion power that pierces the essence of the universe.&gt;

 <p>
  Goo Goo Con limped and stood on the straw, spreading its wings to the sides.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the same time, its eyes flashed with the pupils of a dragon.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;The half-breed Black Dragon you faced only possessed a fraction of the full power.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  So, it’s really powerful.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;That’s right. You’ve already inherited my blood. Even without me, you can use part of the power. But without my help, you can’t fully harness the true power.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “The true power?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;The ability to rule the movement of the universe and stars.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Goo Goo Con flapped its wings.
 </p>
 <p>
  A dark red lightning sprang from its back, forming the shape of a dragon.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then it extended its wings forward.
 </p>

 <p>
  Ziiiing.
 </p>
 <p>
  A branch from the stable door was sucked into Goo Goo Con’s wings.
 </p>
 <p>
  Goo Goo Con handed the branch to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;That is gravity.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;The Black Dragon Scales are just a byproduct. If you gain the qualifications later, you will be able to handle that great power.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “And for that, I need you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;That’s right! It can’t be done without me! It’s a very difficult and complex task!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Goo Goo Con puffed out its chest toward me.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;On the oath of the ancient pact, I swear everything I said is true.&gt;

  “……Hmmm.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I knew something was off.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it was just immunity, I wouldn’t have been able to penetrate its defense. But it didn’t sustain a single scratch in the midst of numerous attribute-infused slashes. It meant some other power was at play.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It is indeed an incredible monster.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t even bring out its original form as a dragon.
 </p>
 <p>
  This creature was one of the top-class monsters among the Advent Monsters I’ve encountered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;What is it?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “There are three others like you, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Since he was said to be from one of the four great families.

 <p>
  “Let’s start by restoring the engraving. You said you deliberately left it out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Hmph. Prepare to be amazed.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Goo Goo Con extended its front wing toward me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Zap! The dark red lightning began to seep into my left arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, there was no ominous feeling like before.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ba-dum!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Engraving complete.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han(★★★★)’ has been engraved with a special ability!]

  [Proof of pure bloodline of the ancient black dragon.]

  [Effect: All attribute defense +20%]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Unique Skill: 1. Black Dragon’s Scales (Duration: 1 second)]
 </p>
 <p>
  [※ There are numerous other undisclosed skills.]
 </p>
 <p>
  I skimmed through the engraving description.
 </p>
 <p>
  There wasn’t much added. Just a line saying there were undisclosed skills.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It has risen to S-rank.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It might not make much difference now.
 </p>
 <p>
  But as the imprint’s level and specs rise, gradually hidden abilities will be unlocked.
 </p>
 <p>
  That must be the ‘qualification’ it mentioned.
 </p>
 <p>
  I rotated my left arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  It didn’t seem much different, but at the end of the movement, there was a strange sensation.
 </p>
 <p>
  It felt like I had an extra arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  Would this be how it feels to grow a tail?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;What is it?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “You said there are three others like you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Hmph, those bastards. Don’t even get me started.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Goo Goo Con clicked its tongue in displeasure.
 </p>
 <p>
  If this creature is the ancestor of one of the four great families, then there must be similar entities in the other three families.
 </p>

 <p>
  ‘So, there are at least three more S-rank engravings in Townia.’
 </p>
 <p>
  This is quite a fortune.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just like the affiliated heroes, engravings also differ depending on the account.
 </p>
 <p>
  But there are many places without even an A-rank, let alone an S-rank engraving.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I can get all three…’
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s like some kind of Dragon Ball quest.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having multiple engravings isn’t necessarily good.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s a matter of how you develop and utilize them.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If the opportunity arises, I should give them to the others.’

 <p>
  There’s no point in just raising my own specs.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;If you fully utilize my power, you can become invincible.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “With all the monsters around, it’s hard to say. Anyway, having you around should be helpful, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Indeed. Just by having me, the source of power, near, you can awaken hidden abilities. I will help you.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I smirked and looked at my left arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  I held the sword in my right hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s test it out.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I instinctively knew how to use it.
 </p>
 <p>
  It felt similar to when I used a skill. I took a deep breath and drew out that feeling.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Engraving activated!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Shwooosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  In an instant, scales sprouted all over my left arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  The black scales tore through my left sleeve, protruding sharply.
 </p>
 <p>
  Without hesitation, I stabbed my forearm with the sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This hero is immune to physical damage!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang!
 </p>
 <p>
  As it repelled the blade, the scales quickly disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  For now, that’s all it was. It only lasted for one second. There seemed to be quite a gap before I could activate it again.
 </p>
 <p>
  It felt like my body was getting tired.
 </p>
 <p>
  I need to practice consistently.
 </p>
 <p>
  To use it in actual combat, I needed to train to combine it with Ascend and the Soulblade Fusion
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Hahahaha! How does it feel? Do you sense my infinite power?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  Splash!
 </p>
 <p>
  I grabbed Goo Goo Con by the neck and dunked it into the water barrel.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ku, Kururur!”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Why?!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your tone is annoying.”

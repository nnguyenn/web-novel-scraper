 <p>
  Several days later.
 </p>
 <p>
  Early in the morning, in the private training room of the training ground, I was catching my breath.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-1" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  In front of me stood a row of dummies resembling humans. They were made of solid steel, tough enough to withstand most attacks without a scratch.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it were the old me, I wouldn’t have dared to challenge them.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But now…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Sreung!
 </p>
 <p>
  In an instant, I drew my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Simultaneously, I lowered my stance and switched on.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★★★★)’ has entered Ascend mode!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Before the searing pain spread throughout my body, I swung my sword, scraping the floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Skill ‘Soulblade Fusion’ activated!]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Here.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [Unique Skill ‘Black Dragon Scales’ activated!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Dragon scales sprouted all over my left arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  The whip-like sword cut through the foremost dummy. The blade, slicing through steel as if it were tofu, continued to leave a mark on the metallic wall of the private training room before disappearing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack!
 </p>
 <p>
  As I sheathed my sword, the shattered steel fragments fell in a heap.
 </p>
 <p>
  The recoil that used to torment me whenever I used Soulblade Fusion was completely gone.
 </p>
 <p>
  All I felt was a slight stiffness in my left arm. I sat on the iron chair and murmured.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Status window.’

  [Unique Skill: 1. Black Dragon Scales (Duration 1 second)]
 </p>
 <p>
  The description of the status window had become quite long.
 </p>
 <p>
  Currently, my level is 40. Recently, I completed my promotion to Fighter. Although my weapon skill levels increased only by 2, the growth of Ascend and Soulblade Fusion was significant. Well, it’s because I practiced them intensively.
 </p>
 <p>
  Additionally, I gained an engraving slot and a new skill.
 </p>
 <p>
  I touched the holographic graphic labeled ‘Dragon Slicer.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dragon Slicer (Lv.1)]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Grade: C+]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Type: Unique, Link]
 </p>
 <p>
  [A linked skill combining Soulblade Fusion and Black Dragon Scales. It nullifies the recoil damage of the Soulblade Fusion. However, it can only be cast with the left hand, and its power is significantly reduced.]

  [Attribute: Fixed Damage]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Note: Exclusive skill for ‘Han Istrate (★★★★)’]
 </p>
 <p>
  Dragon Slicer.
 </p>
 <p>
  A skill that nullifies the recoil of Soulblade Fusion using the damage nullification property of Black Dragon Scales.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the result of my all-night effort to make use of the engraving. However, it wasn’t without its drawbacks.
 </p>
 <p>
  For one, it could only be used with the left hand where the scales appeared, and the skill’s power was considerably reduced.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soulblade Fusion is a skill that utilizes the entire body, while Dragon Slicer only amplifies the power of the left arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  The dragon scales only sprouted up to my left shoulder.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had no particular complaints.
 </p>
 <p>
  The piercing attribute remained, and even with the reduced power, it was sufficient as a finishing move.

 <p>
  There was no need to use Soulblade Fusion in useless places and end up exhausted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Phew.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I wiped the sweat off my forehead with a towel.
 </p>
 <p>
  To acquire this skill, I had to synchronize the activation times of Ascend, Soulblade Fusion, and Black Dragon Scales within one second. Repeating the activation and deactivation of Ascend, I had endured hellish pain.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Goo Goo!”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt; Hmph! Pathetic power. &gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked under the chair.
 </p>
 <p>
  A chubby pigeon was looking up at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt; I brought you the pure Black Dragon Blood, yet you can’t even use it properly. The vessel is good, but you’re just subpar. If it were me… &gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack!

 <p>
  I stomped on the pigeon’s neck.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kuack?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t get cocky.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Crunch.
 </p>
 <p>
  Twisting my foot on the pigeon’s neck, I said.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt; S-stop! Listen till the end. I was trying to say it was decent for the first time! &gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sure you were.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When I lifted my foot, Goo Goo Con rolled on the floor, coughing several times.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took him out of the stable because he didn’t want to stay there, and he was wandering around the waiting room as if it were his own home. It had become a routine for him to intrude into my private training room where even Jenna couldn’t enter.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt; It’s decent for the first time. If you get more familiar with it, you might be able to cover your entire body with scales. Of course, you’ll need me for that! &gt;
 </p>

 <p>
  I nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  So far, the scales only sprouted from my left arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, the duration was less than a second. Once used, it couldn’t be used again for at least an hour. I hadn’t yet discovered what the hidden engraving skill was.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt; You have an unusually high synchronization rate. Normally, when different blood is mixed, one would be in agony at first. It’s fascinating no matter how many times I see it. &gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s probably thanks to the seven-star constitution mentioned by Yurnet and Ridigion.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s likely the reason this guy could enter my body even for a short while.
 </p>
 <p>
  After tidying up the training equipment, I started to loosen up my body.
 </p>
 <p>
  The maintenance after the mission had been long completed. The facilities of the waiting room had been expanded once, and the construction of the second airship was successfully underway. The promotions and job changes of the combat personnel, including mine, as well as the engraving events, had been safely completed.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was time to go on a mission again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yesterday, Anytng distributed consumables to the heroes.

 <p>
  So, it was likely that the mission would start this evening.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt; Ahem. Han, I also want to go on the mission… &gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stop with the nonsense.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt; I can be of help too! I’ve honed my beak attack! With one strike of my beak…! &gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Gu gu gu gu gu!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Goo Goo Con pecked the floor fiercely.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt; Everyone is finished. &gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Iselle.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle appeared, scattering stardust, and looked at Goo Goo Con with disdain.
 </p>
 <p>
  [ Is it you again? ]
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt; You rascal! Call me with respect. I am… &gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  [ Quiet. I heard you tried to backstabl Loki! Just follow quietly without disturbing! ]
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt; Wait! Ugh! &gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle took Goo Goo Con away.
 </p>
 <p>
  Left alone, I started stretching again. The penalty of Ascend doesn’t disappear easily.
 </p>
 <p>
  I needed to return to normal condition by the evening when Anytng was logged in.
 </p>
 <p>
  And that evening.
 </p>
 <p>
  [ Welcome to Pick Me Up! ]
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng connected.
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  Entering the main menu, Anytng opened the item window.
 </p>
 <p>
  He then touched the rainbow-colored ticket at the top, and the antique-patterned ticket enlarged.
 </p>
 <p>
  [5-Star Guaranteed Summon Ticket]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Grade: S]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Use to summon a natural 5-star (★★★★★) hero.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Note 1 – Grand prize of the World Raid Festa]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Note 2 – Congratulations on winning the event!]
 </p>
 <p>
  After scrutinizing the ticket for a while, Anytng closed the item window and started the schedule.
 </p>
 <p>
  He received the operation report from Neryssa, the deputy sub-master, the training report from the training director, Roderick, and the equipment manufacturing report from the representative of the equipment manufacturing facility. Anytng quickly skimmed through the reports filling the screen and continued giving instructions.

 <p>
  ‘…He’s not using it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He didn’t use the 5-star ticket.
 </p>
 <p>
  I thought he would use it immediately upon arrival, but he just stashed it in the warehouse.
 </p>
 <p>
  The reason wasn’t hard to guess.
 </p>
 <p>
  He probably wants to prepare thoroughly for growth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Until now, Anytng has summoned heroes and left them on their own to grow.
 </p>
 <p>
  In other words, he didn’t manage them at all. However, as the training ground level increased and instructors appeared, he became able to designate training methods directly. It seemed he wanted to nurture a hero with his own hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  It will take some time before the 5-star arrives.
 </p>
 <p>
  But…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s suspicious.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Originally, there was no item called a 5-star summon ticket in Pick Me Up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even I, who memorized thousands of items, had never heard of it, and it was suddenly released in this event.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Tell said there are no natural 5-stars in Niflheimr.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If Niflheim obtained a 5-star summon ticket and used it?
 </p>
 <p>
  Would it end up as a failure?
 </p>
 <p>
  Surely not.
 </p>
 <p>
  “….”
 </p>
 <p>
  Maybe it’s fortunate that the 5-star summon is delayed.
 </p>
 <p>
  I strapped my sword to my belt, donned my armor, and left the training room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just in time, Anytng was selecting the party for the mission.
 </p>
 <p>

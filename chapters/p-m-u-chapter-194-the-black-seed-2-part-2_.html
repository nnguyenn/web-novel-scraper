 <p>
  After finishing my meeting with Delphin, I left the barrack.
 </p>
 <p>
  The place where we were summoned was the main camp of the Assinis dispatch troop. The sight of hundreds of barracks spread across the vast plain was quite spectacular. In the distance, at what seemed to be a port, airships carrying troops and supplies were busily coming and going.

 <p>
  ‘So we have allies now?’
 </p>
 <p>
  In the next mission, we will fight shoulder-to-shoulder with them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, that doesn’t mean the difficulty will decrease.
 </p>
 <p>
  I smirked and walked to the place Delphin had mentioned.
 </p>
 <p>
  The floating island Asrank.
 </p>
 <p>
  A small continent floating thousands of meters high.
 </p>
 <p>
  No wonder the air felt thin.
 </p>
 <p>
  The third key is said to be kept deep underground in Asrank by the Joiners.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the Cult’s army has built fortresses along the path leading to the underground. In this segment, we will deal with them and retrieve the key.
 </p>
 <p>
  I walked down the path leading below.
 </p>
 <p>
  The scenery gradually changed. A whitish fog blocked my view.
 </p>
 <p>
  In fact, it’s not fog.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Clouds.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I pushed through the clouds and moved forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  At some point, the clouds disappeared, and I reached the edge of an endless cliff.
 </p>
 <p>
  Beyond it, the faint landscape of the continent came into view.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…You’re here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria, standing at the edge of the cliff, turned to look at me.

 <p>
  Wearing a fur coat, she somehow had a pale expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you doing? It doesn’t suit you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was thinking for a moment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thinking?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria handed me a brooch engraved with a feather pattern.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you know what this is?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have no idea.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I picked it up next to the corpse of Sir Darkhan, who ambushed me at dawn today.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He was appointed as my guard knight when I was five. He always protected me.”

 <p>
  Pria bowed her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can’t understand…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I kept my mouth shut.
 </p>
 <p>
  She doesn’t remember anything.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria smiled bitterly.
 </p>
 <p>
  I stood beside Pria and looked down the cliff.
 </p>
 <p>
  The appearance of the Townia continent was starkly revealed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Where is it?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I quickly scanned the landscape.
 </p>
 <p>
  Delphin had said it. They found a ‘reason’ to help Pria, even while antagonizing the entire empire.
 </p>

 <p>
  My eyes passed over cities and towns, forests and swamps, seas and rivers. Before long, I found that reason.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…This is crazy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It was true.
 </p>
 <p>
  I held my forehead.
 </p>
 <p>
  A headache developed out of nowhere.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Pria.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “When did that appear?”
 </p>
 <p>
  When I pointed to it, Pria answered with a hardened voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It was about a week after we found the second key.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Quite some time has passed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, you can tell just by looking at it.
 </p>
 <p>
  I scanned the bottom again.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Seed of Chaos Lv.???]
 </p>
 <p>
  Estimated size of hundreds of meters.
 </p>
 <p>
  It had taken the form of an egg, sprouting in the middle of the forest.
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the glossy shell, countless black eyes squirmed constantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is insane…’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the so-called Fragment series.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  The culprit that made the 80th floor and above of Pick Me Up a hell.
 </p>
 <p>
  That thing was one of the boss-class… ‘Crystal of Chaos.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Estimated level in the 300s.
 </p>
 <p>
  An attribute-less monster appearing on the 80th floor and above.
 </p>
 <p>
  It had immunity to physical and magical attacks, and other patterns so vicious that it could toy with 6-star max-level heroes.
 </p>
 <p>
  The fact that it hadn’t hatched yet was at least a relief.
 </p>
 <p>
  If that thing appeared right away, it would be the end of us.
 </p>
 <p>
  But looking at its condition, it wasn’t long before it hatched.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That thing…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria spoke with a determined expression.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-7" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  “That thing is what will bring Townia into ruin.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Probably.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If such a thing appeared in the middle of the continent, one’s perspective would change.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to Delphin’s explanation, the Assinis family sent an expedition to deal with it, but the cult’s army and the imperial army blocked their way. They even issued a decree calling the seed a gift from the goddess that would bring peace to the continent.
 </p>
 <p>
  A gift from the goddess.
 </p>
 <p>
  What nonsense.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There’s no time.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I bit my lip.
 </p>
 <p>
  If that thing hatches, the missions’ success rate will drop exponentially.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s like having the final raid boss monster appear in a newbie zone. With our current skills, we wouldn’t inflict any damage on that thing.
 </p>

 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  The egg, filled with flesh, shook violently.
 </p>
 <p>
  Black blood poured out of the holes in the shell like a waterfall.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It looks even worse in person.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing it in person made it even more daunting.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sighed and looked back at Pria.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria was staring at the egg with a firm expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can you stop that thing?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priy nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If we complete the key, we can tear open the rift in the dimension. We intend to send it back to where it originally came from before it hatches.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But, there are many disruptors, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Unfortunately.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The wraiths of Townia.
 </p>
 <p>
  These monsters seems to have a purpose.
 </p>
 <p>
  Through numerous missions and analyses, I could tell. Unlike other accounts where missions were sporadic, Townia had a clear direction.
 </p>
 <p>
  They seem to be scheming together for some trivial purpose.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anyway, the task remains the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Destroy them all.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I gripped my sword hilt.

  I wiped my cheek.

 <p>
  “……”

 <p>
  Blood splattered from Delphin’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  The one Adele praised as the strongest in the Empire had become a bloody mess with just a wave of that woman’s hand. She died, without any proper resistance.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You worm-like b$tch.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Perseine looked at Delphin’s corpse with disdain before shifting her gaze to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  A soft smile appeared on her lips.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You are worlds apart from that trash who moved without any thought or belief. It was impressive how efficiently and effectively you killed our comrades.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  Judging by her speech, she seemed beyond the usual category of monsters.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you think we wouldn’t realize that we were mere sacrifices for the growth of you heroes? Did you really think we’d quietly die by your hands?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Perseine smiled brightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “In other worlds, it might be different, but here, we have our great Prince.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I lowered my stance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ready to move at any moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  The creature before me had ground Delphin to pieces in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  Using some unknown magic.
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t let my guard down even for a moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh my, there’s no need to be so wary.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Perseine laughed gracefully, covering her mouth.

 <p>
  ‘…This is bad.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I never expected things to turn out like this today.
 </p>
 <p>
  Right now, neither Jenna, Velkist, nor Anytng were here.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was just me.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to buy time.’
 </p>
 <p>
  We’re supposed to contact the waiting room periodically.
 </p>
 <p>
  If they don’t hear from us by morning, they’ll send reinforcements immediately.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is your goal?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I opened my mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is it revenge?”
 </p>

 <p>
  Perseine laughed bitterly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m not really interested in revenge. We’re already done with that. We’re just remnants now, just like the current Townia.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then what is it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “First, we want to return the humiliation we suffered, not just equally, but a hundred, a thousand times over.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She said she wasn’t interested in revenge.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perseine threw Delphin’s bloody horn to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  “And second…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is it liberation?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t like men who interrupt. But fine. Liberation, yes, that’s part of it. Ever since this happened…”
 </p>
 <p>
  A bulging black vein throbbed next to Perseine’s eye.

  She gritted her teeth as if in considerable pain.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Every moment feels like madness, every day like hell.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But revenge or liberation, those are just secondary objectives. We don’t cling to such trivial things. We only follow the Prince.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Perseine cradled her cheek with her hand, mumbling with a dreamy expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, Prince…”
 </p>
 <p>
  She seemed out of her mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  I spun my sword. I intended to cut her neck if I saw an opening, but even while she was dazed, her fingers were pointed at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We will… transcend.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……?”
 </p>

 </p>
 <p>
  Transcend.
 </p>
 <p>
  Liberate.
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, a thought struck my mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  What these lunatics aimed to achieve.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They’re aiming to overcome the shackles of the missions, fields, heroes and monsters.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Is that even possible?
 </p>
 <p>
  “You figured it out, didn’t you? As expected, you’re smart, Hero. It’s worth having an eye on you. You’d be perfect as the Prince’s left arm. I’m the right arm, so that’s out of the question.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you recruiting me right now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that a problem?”
 </p>

 <p>
  Perseine winked at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve heard about your exploits. It would be a shame to waste your abilities. Haven’t you had enough of playing the hero? Join us. We’ll treat you well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I see.
 </p>
 <p>
  So she hadn’t picked a fight with me right away and had explained their goals in detail to recruit me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anyway, there’s only one thing to say.
 </p>
 <p>
  “My answer is…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Screw you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The next moment, her finger pointed at my heart.
 </p>
 <p>
  I threw myself flat on the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>

 <p>
  With a deafening roar, one side of the barracks flew away like a torn sheet of paper.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hahaha!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A cheerful laugh flowed from the dust.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Disadvantageous.
 </p>
 <p>
  I threw myself into the hole outside.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, spinning my body once in mid-air, I landed on the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;I’ll make you understand how foolish your choice is!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  A massive vortex erupted from the roof of the barracks, shattering the three-story building to pieces. Soldiers scurried about in panic, screaming.
 </p>

 <p>
  “What the hell is that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t that the captain’s barracks?”
 </p>
 <p>
  A blue shadow jumped out from the rubble of the building.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perseine. She was floating in the air, humming a tune.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You bastard! Who are you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  A knight drew his sword and shouted.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perseine laughed joyfully and pointed at the knight.
 </p>
 <p>
  Slash!
 </p>
 <p>
  The knight was turned into a chunk of meat in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perseine’s deep blue robe fluttered wildly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon, magical spheres began to float around her robe.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dozens of magical spheres gradually transformed in the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  They burned or froze, spinning fiercely and sending lightning bolts in all directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;I am Perseine Riedel von Strabern, the rightful heir of Shutenberg, the forebear of magic!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Therefore, I command you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Unleash!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The soldiers didn’t even have time to react.
 </p>
 <p>
  The magical spheres launched from Perseine’s robe began to bombard the camp indiscriminately.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Argh!”
 </p>

 <p>
  A man’s flesh was torn apart.
 </p>
 <p>
  The magical spheres incinerated several meters radius wherever they fell.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flesh flew, barracks burned, and the ground was upturned.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hahahahaha!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom! Boom boom boom boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  Perseine fired magical spheres with catastrophic power like a machine gun.
 </p>
 <p>
  I dodged the bombardment points and ran towards the barracks.
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s a dimensional gate connected to the waiting room there.
 </p>
 <p>
  I needed to call the first party members.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, by the way, Hero.”

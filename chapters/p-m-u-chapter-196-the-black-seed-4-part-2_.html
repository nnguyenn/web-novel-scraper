  “You seemed quite fond of one of my disciples.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  「La Grand Sedus.」
 </p>
 <p>
  This crazy bastard…
 </p>
 <p>
  「Ignite!」
 </p>
 <p>
  A spark ignited in front of my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  I slid down as if performing a slide tackle.
 </p>
 <p>
  「Explode!」
 </p>
 <p>
  I threw myself.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  An explosion with flames erupted behind me.
 </p>
 <p>
  「Sublimate!」
 </p>
 <p>
  A pillar of flame soared from the epicenter.
 </p>
 <p>
  The last one…
 </p>
 <p>
  「Fuse!」
 </p>
 <p>
  I kicked off a broken pillar of the barracks and jumped up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking back, a small sun was sucking in surrounding objects like a black hole.

 <p>
  “Oh my, I’m so scared. Eolka, that fool had no talent but was full of greed! Good thing she’s dead!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Grinding my teeth.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had to endure.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s not time yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where is the captain? Where is the captain?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Find the commanding officer! Who’s giving the orders?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ambush! It’s an ambush! Run!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The expedition camp was in chaos.

 <p>
  Arrows and ballista bolts were bouncing off the barrier, and the bombardment from the sky was relentless. Moreover, the personnel to command the troops had been massacred in the meeting hall.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was exactly like when I annihilated the cult’s high command on the 40th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  Each explosion sent a dozen soldiers flying.
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s no match. That mage was like a fallen disaster.
 </p>
 <p>
  I reached the barracks.
 </p>
 <p>
  I ran inside, almost flying, and pulled aside the cloth to enter.
 </p>
 <p>
  The dimensional gate should be in the corner of the left wall…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s not here?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t see it.

  The mission objective window floating in front of me began to shake violently.

 </p>
 <p>
  A personal mission?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘F$ck…’
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s no time to waste.
 </p>
 <p>
  I hurried out of the barracks.
 </p>
 <p>
  More than half of the expedition camp was in ruins.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Keep your wits about you.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I gritted my teeth.

 <p>
  This mission is an escape one.
 </p>
 <p>
  A personal mission that only I can carry out, with additional conditions.
 </p>
 <p>
  I and Pria must survive.
 </p>
 <p>
  First of all…
 </p>
 <p>
  I need to find Priya.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her barracks were located quite far outside the camp. I turned and ran. The magical bombardment from Perseine was still raining down from the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Does that bastard have infinite mana?’
 </p>
 <p>
  She fired at least a thousand magic spheres, yet she was still humming.

  “What are we supposed to do…”
 </p>
 <p>
  A knight was flustered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Behind him, soldiers in similar states were hesitating.
 </p>
 <p>
  They had gathered at the assembly point according to the emergency protocols, but there was no commander to give orders. I approached them abruptly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You are…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Listen to me. All the expedition officers are dead. That so-called strongest in the Empire is the same.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What! The captain? That can’t be…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shut up. Gather the scattered troops and get out of the camp. Save as many people as you can.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But, the captain’s orders…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I frowned as the knight hesitated, biting his lip.

 <p>
  “Good. Once you gather enough, head to the landing zone and secure an airship.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Move! Gather the troops and escape!”
 </p>
 <p>
  He followed orders fairly quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  He must have plenty of experience in battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  I patted the knight on the shoulder and ran toward Pria’s barracks.
 </p>
 <p>
  About a minute passed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  From beyond the barracks, soldiers were flung several meters into the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  They flew up together like jacks.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moments later.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud. Thud thud thud.
 </p>
 <p>
  The soldiers who had been thrown up fell back down in a mass.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There’s someone there.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I gripped my sword tightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Something appeared in front of me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instinctively, I raised my left arm.

  My body flew at high speed and crashed into a mixture of stone and wood debris.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……Ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  What kind of insane strength is this…
 </p>
 <p>
  Not even the Black Dragon Scales could completely nullify it?

 <p>
  “Ho.”

  A middle-aged man walked out.

 <p>
  With a lion-like mane of brown hair and an upper body bursting with muscles, the man looked at me with interest.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You endured my punch. Impressive.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You… bastard…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I wiped the blood from my mouth and staggered to my feet.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;How about this?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then I fell to my knees again.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……Ugh?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  My right hand clenched my throat on its own.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack. The grip tightened.
 </p>
 <p>
  My left hand moved on its own and pulled a dagger from my belt.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is this…’
 </p>
 <p>
  My body was no longer under my control?
 </p>
 <p>
  The blade in my left hand pointed toward my heart.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kneeling, I barely managed to move my eyes.

  A small girl stood before me, wearing a white nun’s habit, her left eye barely open.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Hero, you will die here.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “……Screw you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At this point, there’s no need to hesitate.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before the dagger in my left hand could reach my heart,
 </p>
 <p>
  I bit my tongue hard.
 </p>

 <p>
  Pria’s face turned pale.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That is…….”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Glad to see her again?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The calm and composed Sir Persene is acting like…… Mm!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I covered Pria’s mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  The church’s soldiers were blocking the exit leading outside the camp.
 </p>
 <p>
  In front of them stood a stout middle-aged man. The Beast King, Kiadni.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Damn it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I changed direction again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Back to the left exit.
 </p>
 <p>
  A saintess in white stood at the left exit.
 </p>
 <p>
  Behind her, I could see the splendidly armored Holy Knights.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;There’s nowhere to run, Hero.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Persene descended from the sky to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  The left, right, and front were all blocked.
 </p>
 <p>
  Behind the camp was a cliff leading to the ground far below.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What should…… we do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria gulped, looking at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Break through the front?’
 </p>

 <p>
  Not a chance.
 </p>
 <p>
  The chance of success was too low.
 </p>
 <p>
  It might be possible alone, but Pria was with me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, was there another way?
 </p>
 <p>
  “……Damn.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I closed my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Last night, I stared at the map of the floating island all night.
 </p>
 <p>
  It didn’t take long to come to a conclusion.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Pria, follow me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where are you planning to go?”

  “To the cliff.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But there…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t say anything.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria, looking up at me, nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it. I trust you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t trust me too much.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria and I headed for the cliff behind the camp.
 </p>
 <p>
  The church’s forces knew our location, so there was no need to hide.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whooosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  The wind pushed against us.

 </div>
 <p>
  I firmly planted my feet and looked back.
 </p>
 <p>
  Beyond the sheer cliff, I could see the distant ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria clung tightly to my coat.
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled and spun my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hundreds of soldiers and dozens of knights.
 </p>
 <p>
  Three leaders were approaching me from different directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hero, if you were going to run, you should have left her behind. We might have let you go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Persene smiled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I wanted to fight you fairly as a warrior, but it’s a pity.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kiadni walked over, arms crossed.
 </p>

 <p>
  &lt;…….&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The saintess approached silently with her eyes closed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is just.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A solo mission that can only be accomplished by one person.
 </p>
 <p>
  The difficulty was skyrocketing, enough to break through the graph.
 </p>
 <p>
  No conscience at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not that it’s the first time.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hand over that woman.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Persene said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sir Persene!”

 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait, please listen! I…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I told you to shut up!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Persene shouted, her bloodshot eyes glaring at Pria.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria closed her mouth with a painful expression as if she had been slapped.
 </p>
 <p>
  Persene looked back at me and smiled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hero, let’s talk again. Do you really think you can win? If you want to keep your life, make the right choice.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;The Crown Prince values you very highly.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The saintess stepped forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You, a warrior of such excellence, are worthy of joining our great cause. Hand over that girl and join us, warrior.”

 <p>
  Next, the Beast King added.
 </p>
 <p>
  I thought for a while and then spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If I hand over Pria, what will happen to her?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  Persene raised her right hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh! A blade-like wind whirled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll repay her suffering many times over. We’ll make it so she can’t live or die. We’ll make her taste every pain in the world. She’ll beg for death, crying for us to kill her.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A traitor deserves a fitting punishment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;I agree.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned and looked back.
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  “……Han.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria was looking at me with teary eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no sense of grace as a princess in her gaze.
 </p>
 <p>
  She was just a scared girl, terrified of what was to come.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If, if you survive, it’s o, o, okay. You, you can hand me over…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re stuttering.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I gently tapped Pria’s forehead.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then I faced forward again.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Hero, we have a great cause. To save everyone suffering in this world. You know that what’s happening in this world is wrong.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The saintess’s voice echoed in my head.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her voice itself contained magic.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, a great cause. To destroy this twisted world and bring peace to everyone. I’ll tell you a truth you didn’t know. What we’ve been through, why we’ve become like this. The true nature of that traitorous b$tch, the unknown truth, the ugly reality…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Utter bullshit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Persene’s face hardened in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The unknown truth? The ugly reality?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I laughed.
 </p>
 <p>
  I tried to hold it in, but I couldn’t.
 </p>
 <p>
  Laughter burst out.
 </p>
 <p>
  I don’t know what they were like before.
 </p>
 <p>
  But now, they’re just.

  “Why should I join a bunch of pathetic bastards?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……What did you say?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I twisted my mouth into a smirk.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you think you’re the only ones who’ve had it tough? Do you think you’re the only ones who have been through this crap?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There are many people who get dragged into things they didn’t have anything to do with in the first place, they bleed, and nearly died multiple times, and still crawled through the dirt.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Every day was a battle and a living hell.
 </p>
 <p>
  Days of agony, hovering between life and death.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ve killed countless enemies and watched comrades die countless times.
 </p>
 <p>
  But I.

 <p>
  “I don’t take out my anger on others.”
 </p>
 <p>
  They probably figured it out.
 </p>
 <p>
  That Pria was just being used by Tel.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Repaying the pain you’ve received?’
 </p>
 <p>
  They’re talking nonsense.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though I’ve been in this shitty situation, I haven’t dragged others down with me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I end the misfortune with me.
 </p>
 <p>
  And I overcome it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Tell your boss. Stop bullshitting and keep washing his neck until the day he dies.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  The three didn’t say anything.
 </p>
 <p>
  They just stared at me with cold eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  I grinned.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s obvious what kind of cause these guys are talking about.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Was that your last words?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Persene muttered.
 </p>
 <p>
  In an emotionless tone devoid of any inflection.
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t respond and turned around.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Pria.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I whispered softly, and Pria nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hold on tight. Don’t let go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “O, okay.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria clung to my sleeve tightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  I spun my sword once and faced forward again.
 </p>
 <p>
  The three were slowly approaching me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You guys should think about it too. What kind of scream you’ll make when your heads fly off.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Crazy bastard.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Persene reached out to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I responded by extending my middle finger and grabbed Pria.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then, I threw myself over the cliff.

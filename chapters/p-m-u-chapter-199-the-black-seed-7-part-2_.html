 <p>
  I looked down.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sparrow was pecking at small pieces of meat.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  &lt;You have three paths.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The sparrow spoke while diligently pecking.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;The first is to report this to the goddess. More precisely, your master can submit a bug report. Executors will likely be dispatched.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;If that happens, the monsters will return to where they came from. The mission might be corrected in a normal direction.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng hasn’t logged in yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  If Anytng logs into Pick Me Up and sees the current situation, he’s likely to report it. Even without sending a bug report, just posting a video on the official forum would force Möbius headquarters to address the issue.
 </p>
 <p>
  This method had the highest survival rate if analyzed coldly.
 </p>
 <p>
  After taking a position, I just need to hold out until headquarters takes action.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, if that happens.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Tell will have room to intervene.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The same would apply if another executive came.
 </p>
 <p>
  If they analyzed the game logs in detail, they’d find several suspicious points about me. In the process…….
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘My identity will be revealed.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The heroes belonging to Townia would find out too.
 </p>
 <p>
  If that happens, I won’t be able to stay in Townia.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’d be forced to return to Niflheimr.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before that, the operators might impose sanctions.

 <p>
  ‘The penalty is too big.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Unless it’s the worst of the worst, I don’t want to use this option.
 </p>
 <p>
  What I’ve built up could collapse in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s the second?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I muttered, making sure Pria couldn’t hear.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Solve it yourself. You’ve done well so far, haven’t you?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “……Ha.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;You’ve handled such complex missions before. You’ve come up using all sorts of extraordinary methods. Just do the same this time.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Easy to say.
 </p>
 <p>
  Solving it alone, as I’ve done so far.

 </div>
 <p>
  Not wrong.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ve cleared numerous bug-like missions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just because another one appeared doesn’t mean I should hesitate.
 </p>
 <p>
  Trusting my judgment and overcoming it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if the raid party is just me, even if there’s a burden attached, and even if various penalties pile up, there is always a strategy for the mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s the rule of Pick Me Up.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But I can’t just forget what happened on the 35th floor.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s the third?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;If that kid uses interference power, we can respond in the same way.&gt;
 </p>

 <p>
  I frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t tell me to use that power. I don’t know how.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;I’m not expecting you to.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then what?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;There’s another of the golden bloodline.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The sparrow spread its wings.
 </p>
 <p>
  Following its wing, I saw Pria with a troubled face.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Use that girl.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “How?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;That’s for you to figure out.&gt;
 </p>

 <p>
  I thought the third option was some kind of secret plan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because they transcended monsters using the prince’s bloodline, so, now we should awaken the princess’s bloodline?
 </p>
 <p>
  What would happen then, would NPCs transcend?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Are 7-star heroes, monsters, and NPCs going to run wild in Townia?’
 </p>
 <p>
  That would be a complete mess.
 </p>
 <p>
  I scoffed. What a ridiculous idea.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it provided a specific method, maybe. But telling me to figure it out?
 </p>
 <p>
  The third option suggested by the sparrow was a gamble.
 </p>
 <p>
  The success rate was close to zero.
 </p>
 <p>
  If there were no other options, I’d consider it, but it’s still a no.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-6" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 </div>
 <p>
  ‘Actually, there’s one more thing we could do.’
 </p>
 <p>
  There was a fourth option the sparrow didn’t know about.
 </p>
 <p>
  Calling in my backup.
 </p>
 <p>
  In other words, bringing Niflheimr into full-scale involvement.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  I fiddled with the ring on my left hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  The three weapon summoning chances were exhausted, but the transdimensional communication still worked.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet always told me to ask for help whenever I needed it. If I ask for help, she will appear with a smile, as always.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If that happens…….’
 </p>
 <p>
  I can no longer stay as ‘Han Israt.’
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-7" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  With the bug spanning across all mission areas, it would be impossible to handle it discreetly.
 </p>
 <p>
  It would inevitably reveal my connection with Niflheimr.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I would have to leave.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The first option might be brushed off.
 </p>
 <p>
  But this method was almost 100%.
 </p>
 <p>
  From then on, I have to live as Loki from Niflheimr, not Han Israt from Townia.
 </p>
 <p>
  Life would become more comfortable, and the survival rate would increase.
 </p>
 <p>
  There would be more opportunities to become stronger.
 </p>
 <p>
  I would practically be a king there.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…….”
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-12" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 </div>
 <p>
  I closed my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  If I borrow Niflheimr’s power to deal with the prince and then leave, Townia would return to normal.
 </p>
 <p>
  The difficulty graph, which had been rising steeply, would drop.
 </p>
 <p>
  The heroes who struggled with every mission would be able to fight more easily.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Still.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It wouldn’t last long.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whatever account, at a certain point, the difficulty rises insanely.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether Townia or Niflheimr, it doesn’t matter. The increased difficulty never drops.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once at the 50th floor, once again at the 60th floor, and one more time at the 70th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the process, only a few hundred out of tens of millions of masters survive.
 </p>
 <p>
  I slowly calculated.
 </p>
 <p>
  How far the current Townia can go without me?
 </p>
 <p>
  The survival rate of the rankers.
 </p>
 <p>
  The conclusion came soon.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Less than 10%.’
 </p>
 <p>
  That was reality.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s not just about skill.
 </p>
 <p>
  Luck is also crucial for climbing. During a mission, you might be backstabbed by a PK user or encounter a boss with extreme antagonism to your main party.
 </p>
 <p>
  If so,
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna dies.

 <p>
  So do Velkist, Kishasha, Edis, and Katiio.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hundreds of heroes in the waiting room would be slaughtered, and Iselle would disappear too.
 </p>
 <p>
  The master might quit the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  For Anytng, Pick Me Up would become a bitter memory.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ultimately…….
 </p>
 <p>
  I sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite all the fuss about having multiple methods, the only choice I could make was just one.
 </p>
 <p>
  If I were my old self, I would have chosen the fourth option without hesitation, but things have changed a bit now.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Sigh.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I opened my eyes.

  “Zeeth (★) is bleeding. His stamina decreases at regular intervals.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Switch!”

 <p>
  “Zeeth, Are you okay?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I said switch! Don’t worry about him! Block those goblins!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The passage on my left is completely blocked.
 </p>
 <p>
  Goblin bodies are propped up against the wall, serving as a temporary barricade. It should hold them off for a while.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jenna, treat to Zeeth’s wounds and stop the bleeding.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What about the goblins?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll handle them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Without hesitation, I dashed towards the open space.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as I reached the area, I caught a glimpse of one attempting to leap off the roof. In the midst of the desperate act, their head was severed and fell to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna tore her sleeve with a dagger and swiftly wrapped Zeeth’s wounds, applying pressure to stop the bleeding.
 </p>
 <p>
  “My hand, my hand!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The goblin threat is eliminated!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I dragged Zeeth away from the fight.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Pull yourself together, kid! Do you want us all to perish? It’s only your left hand that’s injured. Wield your sword with your right hand!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m sorry… You’re right…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Quickly stop the bleeding and collect yourself. If you don’t switch with Hanson, he’ll meet his demise.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, understood!”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Jenna, return to your position once the bleeding is under control.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I will!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, three goblins scrambled over the wall and stumbled into the open space.
 </p>
 <p>
  Reacting swiftly, I swung my sword, cleaving through the air. The upper torsos of two goblins within reach tilted and fell askew. The remaining goblin met its end as my shield connected with its neck, thanks to its sharp edge.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, the makeshift barricade made of goblin corpses started to crumble on the left.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some goblins even attempted to clamber over the mound of bodies.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No time for cursing.” I pressed my sword against the face of a goblin descending from above. The goblin met its fate, skewered on my blade, frozen in mid-air. On the other side, two goblins were making their way over the wall once more.
 </p>
 <p>
  Using a sword is not ideal. The distance I need to cover is too great. But I refuse to halt. If those creatures make their way towards Aaron or Hanson, our troubles will multiply. With determined steps, I closed in on the two goblins, swiftly severing their throats. This time, three goblins emerged from various hiding spots.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aren’t you over yet?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re finished here!”

 <p>
  “Kiiiiii!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The goblin corpses barricading the left passage collapsed, causing a flood of goblins to pour out.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m heading back. Deal with those wretches!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna rose to her feet and unleashed her arrows without delay. Three goblins stood frozen, struck simultaneously by her lightning-like triple shots.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, goblins that had broken through the barricade were pouring out from the left.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Back inside, you scoundrels!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I exerted all my strength as I struck the foremost goblin. The creature staggered, and like a line of dominos, fell, taking down the goblins behind it. I thrust my sword forward without hesitation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our efforts to defend the open space had consumed valuable time. Paradoxically, the left side had become the most perilous. A goblin’s dagger, slipping through the gaps between the corpses, grazed the elbow of my leather armor. Had the dagger been slightly sharper, it would have pierced my bone. Swiftly, I severed the goblin’s wrist.
 </p>
 <p>
  If there was an enemy still standing, I dispatched it. I refused to allow any advance. I pushed back with my shield and thrust my sword forward. One goblin fell, impaled through the chest, as I continued to drive it in. The goblin horde, consisting of dozens of them, relentlessly pushed forward.

 <p>
  ….
 </p>
 <p>
  “My sword won’t penetrate!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, Hanson’s urgent cry echoed through the chaos.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Zeeth, can you switch out?” I shouted
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m… I’m okay! I can keep fighting!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Switch with someone else. Hanson, step back and repair the sword!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [14:35]
 </p>
 <p>
  Hanson withdrew to the open space and vigorously wiped the blood-stained blade with his sleeve. Soon, its true condition became apparent, prompting a deep groan from Hanson.
 </p>
 <p>
  The blade was worn down. It was to be expected. It fared better than the old, grade F iron sword, but in the end, it was just an ordinary piece of iron.
 </p>
 <p>
  I faced the same situation. Although the performance difference hadn’t affected me yet, I could feel the stiffness in my blade.

 <p>
  “Even without a razor-sharp edge, I can take down goblins!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I struck a goblin with my shield, snapping its neck and causing it to collapse lifelessly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Taking advantage of the brief pause, I surveyed the open space. Dozens of goblin corpses lay strewn about, and there seemed to be no immediate influx of intruders.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron wasn’t faring well either. The barricade had long crumbled, and the goblin ranks were steadily advancing. Our thrusting speed had noticeably slowed a visible sign of fatigue.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jenna, switch with Aaron.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But I’m not tired yet…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Step aside!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna swiftly leaped forward and slit the goblin’s throat.
 </p>
 <p>
  A gush of blood erupted, staining Jenna’s clothes, but she paid it no mind as she continued to wield her dagger.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Rest when you can. Don’t be stubborn about it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, understood…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron slumped against the open space’s wall, gasping for breath. His spear was splattered with blood, the stains reaching even the handle.
 </p>
 <p>
  [12:35]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Only three minutes left, just hold on for three more minutes!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Had 30 minutes ever felt so long?
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, I could gradually sense the fatigue creeping in. However, I couldn’t afford to switch out just yet. I kept thrusting and jabbing at the advancing goblins.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aaron, switch with Jenna!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron swiftly rose to his feet, clutching his spear, and dashed to the right.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron hadn’t even had a minute of rest. The goblins started scaling the wall again, forcing him back into the fray. Jenna had to leave the open space to deal with the goblins in her area.

  “Stop climbing up already! It’s so frustrating!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna grumbled as she drew her bowstring. More than half of the arrows in her quiver had been used up. While she managed to retrieve some, many had snapped or become damaged during the process.
 </p>
 <p>
  [11:22]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Whew, huff, huff, huff!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Zeeth struggled to catch his breath, his eyes sunken.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hanson, switch out!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, yes!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Hanson, gripping his sword and shield, hurried towards him, his complexion pale.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jenna, shoot arrows toward Hanson’s position.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What? But…”
 </p>

 <p>
  Jenna glanced at the quiver on her back.
 </p>
 <p>
  I knew. There weren’t many arrows left.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, if they break through there, we’re done for. Throw rocks at the goblins if you have to!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ping!
 </p>
 <p>
  An arrow pierced through a goblin’s throat. The goblin convulsed, clutching a knife in its trembling hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  That knife found its mark in Zeeth’s abdomen as he tried to switch out with Hanson.
 </p>
 <p>
  “….!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Zeeth’s pupils dilated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unintelligible groans escaped his gaping mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud.
 </p>
 <p>
  Zeeth collapsed, landing face-first.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crimson blood spilled from his abdomen.
 </p>
 <p>
  [“Geed (★)” has fallen into a critical state. His life is in grave danger!]
 </p>
 <p>
  I clenched my teeth.

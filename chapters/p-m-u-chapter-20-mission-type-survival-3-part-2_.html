 <p>
  This was no time for emergency treatment. If any one of us stepped out, the passage would be immediately breached.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hanson swung his sword, unaware of Zeeth’s fading life behind him.

 <p>
  Zeeth let out a faint gasp.
 </p>
 <p>
  Foamy blood mixed with his breath, trickling out.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna swiftly rotated her body and unleashed four arrows in quick succession. Each arrow found its mark on a different goblin vaulting over the wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, the quiver ran dry.
 </p>
 <p>
  [08:05]
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna rushed to Zeeth’s side.
 </p>
 <p>
  His eyes grew hazy, unaware of what lay before him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Damn it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As her dager came down, the goblin’s skull split vertically.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, ugh, ah…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if there was time for emergency treatment, there was no solution.
 </p>
 <p>
  To pull out the knife embedded in his abdomen? It would unleash a gush of blood like a fountain.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna knew there was nothing she could do. She slowly shook her head and rose again, gripping her bow.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Zeeth (★)’ has returned to the embrace of the goddess! His unwavering spirit will be forever remembered.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ze… Zeeth, just take over for a moment. I only need 30 seconds… Just a moment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Hanson gasped, his words trailing off.
 </p>
 <p>
  But there was no one left to listen.

 <p>
  A goblin thrust its spear. I caught it at my side and yanked it out. The long spear slid out smoothly. It had been a while since I wielded such a useful weapon. Gripping the spear with both hands, I thrust it forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  First one pierced, second one too, third, fourth, all the way to the sixth.
 </p>
 <p>
  I poured every ounce of strength into it. The muscles in my ankles and calves flexed with vigor.
 </p>
 <p>
  I pressed on. A powerful recoil surged back. I clenched my teeth, tasting the tang of blood. The goblins in the passage began to give ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  With unwavering resolve, I drove the spear into the goblin’s chest, piercing through to the handle.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kueeeek!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I must have pierced at least ten of them.
 </p>
 <p>
  A momentary pause befell the goblin advance.
 </p>
 <p>
  I dashed straight to the open space.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hanson, head to the left passage! I’ll handle this side!”

  “Hyung-nim? What about Zeeth…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He’s resting, exhausted. No time for words, just go!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, understood!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Hanson dashed off to the left.
 </p>
 <p>
  He seemed to have missed Zeeth’s lifeless body on the ground. The path was blocked by a heap of goblin corpses, granting us a brief respite of 30 seconds to a minute.
 </p>
 <p>
  I flicked my sword, wiping away the sticky blood and fat.
 </p>
 <p>
  [In the face of dire circumstances, the heroes’ spirits awaken!]

  Being hailed as a hero or sacrificing oneself meant nothing if it led to certain death.
 </p>
 <p>
  Without hesitation, I charged forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  The situation in this corridor was reaching a breaking point. Though trapped in a narrow passageway, the goblins were waiting for the balance to tip, ready to flood the open space in a relentless onslaught.
 </p>
 <p>
  I struck the foremost goblin’s head with force. Despite kicking their chests with all my might, they held their ground. The goblins behind them acted as a cushion, absorbing the impact. Well, then let them die right there. I kicked and struck them repeatedly until they met their end, blood spewing from their mouths.

 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna gripped her dagger tightly, swiftly maneuvering across the open space.
 </p>
 <p>
  The arrows had long been depleted. The goblins, undeterred by the towering wall, surged over it one after another.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aaargh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Hanson (★)’ is experiencing bleeding. Health decreases at regular intervals.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A cry echoed from the left passageway.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hanson’s right arm was drenched in blood, bearing the marks of a brutal slashing.
 </p>
 <p>
  The bleeding was severe, far from a clean cut.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…We no longer can fight back.’
 </p>
 <p>
  “Gather in the open space! Abandon the passageways! Strengthen the walls!”
 </p>

  The goblins had four entry points.
 </p>
 <p>
  The left, right, and lower alleyways, and finally, the stone wall surrounding the open area.
 </p>
 <p>
  To halt their advance, we needed a minimum of four people.
 </p>
 <p>
  Remaining in combat readiness were myself, Jenna, and Aaron.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hyung-nim, save me! Please, save me!”
 </p>
 <p>
  If I went to his aid, I would be putting myself in jeopardy.
 </p>
 <p>
  I clenched my teeth, I really had no choice.
 </p>
 <p>
  I made my way towards the open space.
 </p>
 <p>
  Goblins poured out from the lower passage like an unstoppable wave.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where should we regroup? Where?”

 <p>
  Aaron seemed flustered.
 </p>
 <p>
  His leather armor was unrecognizable, soaked in blood from head to toe. I likely didn’t look much better.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jenna, Aaron, stick close to me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Hanson (★)’ has returned to the embrace of the goddess! His unwavering spirit will be forever remembered.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What about Zeeth and Hanson… Are they dead?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you want to mourn, do it after we’ve survived!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The path was open. Goblins flooded out onto the open space, resembling an army of ants.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna, Aaron, and I positioned ourselves with our backs against the northern wall. I took the center, Aaron on the right, and Jenna on the left.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are we going to die here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t speak such nonsense.”

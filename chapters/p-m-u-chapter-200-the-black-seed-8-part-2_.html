  The scales didn’t disappear even after a second had passed.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a result of risking my life and training for a week, I had mastered the second stage of the Black Dragon’s Blood.

  &lt;Don’t overuse it! It’s too much power for you!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yadda, yadda, yadda. So noisy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The dragon scales sprouted over my left arm, extending to part of my chest.
 </p>
 <p>

 <p>
  A warning message popped up on Anytng’s screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng quickly closed the window and zoomed in on the play screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…….’
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  I drew my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  The massive iron gate, several meters high, was right before my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Up to this point, the activation time of the Black Dragon’s Scales was 5 seconds.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The maximum is 10 seconds.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I adjusted my grip on the sword with my left hand and took a powerful step forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Combined Skill, ‘Dragon Slaycer’ activated!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  A huge crack appeared on the front of the gate as if it had been hit by a bomb.

  By the third strike, the sword couldn’t withstand it anymore and shattered into pieces.
 </p>
 <p>
  I extended my left hand towards the deputy on the wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Unique Skill, ‘Absorb’ activated!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Dark red lightning sprang from my left hand, and the sword the guy was holding flew towards me as if sucked in.
 </p>
 <p>
  Absorb.
 </p>
 <p>
  A second ability was gained when the Black Dragon Blood level rose to 2.

 </p>
 <p>
  By the fifth strike, a large hole was punched through the front of the iron gate.
 </p>
 <p>
  I threw away the shattered sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Up to this point, 10 seconds.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment, the scales that had sprouted to my left chest disappeared.

  I never intended to climb the wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  As if they expect me to climb the wall, with hundreds of soldiers swarming up there.
 </p>
 <p>
  I kicked away the fragments of the broken gate and stepped into the fortress.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;You won’t last long.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “I know.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The pounding of my heart became intense.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how much training I’d gone through, maintaining the Ascend state for long was a huge burden.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I have to do it as fast as possible.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I swung a jab.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a sound like fireworks going off, the body of a soldier who was staring blankly at me was pulverized and vanished.

  Soldiers gathered like ants within the fortress.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was also within the expected range.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Where is it?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Somewhere in here, there was an entrance leading underground.

 </p>
 <p>
  The arrow pointed to a corner of the fortress.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Good.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The target was set.

 <p>
  I pulled out a potion from my pouch, drank it in one gulp, and threw the bottle away.

 <p>
  The enemies kept swarming in.
 </p>
 <p>
  The number of troops shown on the status window was two to three times, no, even more.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soldiers of the Church kept appearing from all over the fortress.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is this a suicide mission?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed, it was a risky strategy.
 </p>
 <p>
  I would never have chosen it in a normal situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  The survival rate was extremely low.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But…….’
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s no other way.

  Except to fight with my body.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kill him!”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a shout, they charged at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  After cutting down one of them, I leaped off the ground. I jumped a few meters up and landed on the wall. Soldiers were approaching in a line on the narrow wall path.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…….’
 </p>
 <p>
  I spun my sword around.
 </p>
 <p>
  And poured the boiling power into my whole body.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crunch!
 </p>
 <p>
  With each strike, two or three soldiers died.
 </p>
 <p>
  Their armor and swords shattered and broke.
 </p>
 <p>
  Weapons lost their edge every ten seconds.
 </p>
 <p>
  When my sword broke, I grabbed another soldier’s sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  When that broke, I used spears or axes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What… What kind of monster is that! Archers, prepare! Shoot in unison!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But our allies…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s an order!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thunk!
 </p>
 <p>
  I flinched.
 </p>
 <p>
  An arrow had struck my back.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…….’

 <p>
  Well, dozens of archers were continuously shooting.
 </p>
 <p>
  I broke the arrow shaft and used a corpse as a shield to advance along the narrow wall path.
 </p>
 <p>
  Papapapapap! Dozens of arrows quickly turned the corpse into a porcupine.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is that the entrance?’
 </p>
 <p>
  There was a passage inside the fortress that seemed to lead to the cave.
 </p>
 <p>
  Various barricades and obstacles were set up, with spearmen and knights taking positions.
 </p>
 <p>
  I clicked my tongue.
 </p>
 <p>
  I can’t afford to linger any longer.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ascend was already reaching its limit.

 <p>
  [Danger!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [High Inquisitor]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Noble Raskandar Lv.53]
 </p>
 <p>
  A knight stepped forward from the barricade.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I acknowledge your strength. But it seems you can’t go any further. Surrender.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I threw away the corpse full of hundreds of arrows.
 </p>
 <p>
  I pulled a large steel halberd from the pile of corpses.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re bluffing. If you want to die, I won’t stop you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I smirked and gripped the halberd tightly with both hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then I bent my waist and knees.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  I took off with a leap.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You foolish bastard!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The knight, shouting loudly, drew his sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I am Raskandar Izeral! A senior paladin who has dedicated his life to justice, I will exterminate you! Let’s fight fair and square!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The knight performed a grand stance and charged at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flutter!
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, the sparrow flew out in front of the knight’s eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Take this! My surprise beak attack!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “……?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thunk.
 </p>
 <p>
  The guy clutched his face where he was pecked on the nose.
 </p>
 <p>
  Immediately, my halberd cleaved the knight in half along with his armor.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What a joke.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Amidst the falling piles of blood, I laughed.

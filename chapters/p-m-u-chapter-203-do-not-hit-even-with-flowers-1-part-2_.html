  [Welcome to Pick Me Up!]
 </p>
 <p>
  In the evening,
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-1" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  [Loading is complete.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [T O U C H! (Select)]
 </p>
 <p>
  As usual, Anytng logged in.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, there is an unread report. Would you like to check it?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Writer – ‘Han (★★★★)’]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes (Select) / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  The report I had written appeared on the control screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  It detailed how the heroes Anytng had recruited last night were training and that the second airship was successfully built.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Beep!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Sub Master ‘Han (★★★★)’s suggestion]
 </p>
 <p>
  [It is recommended to build a new airship.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng immediately entered the warehouse to check the items.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, there were hardly any materials left. After closing the warehouse, Anytng paused at the main screen for a while. He seemed to be contemplating what to do.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I miss the old days.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked to my side.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist, who had taken off his shirt, was swinging a sword at a steel dummy.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The old days?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s so annoying to care about others. Back then, I only had to think about myself.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Why, you don’t like teaching?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t make me laugh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist pulled out a blue dagger and slashed his forearm.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a special paralyzing drug made by Neryssa.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a paralyzed state, Velkist continued to swing his sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Wild Mode.
 </p>
 <p>
  A skill that converts status ailments into strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  That guy had learned a battle method as reckless as mine.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t like fighting in groups. I also dislike pretending to be friendly and sticking together.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Crash!

 <p>
  The upper body of a steel golem was shattered and flew away.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a strength that surpassed human limits.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hero or whatever, I can’t stand complicated situations. It’s either kill or be killed, nothing more.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re a scary guy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re not one to talk, senior.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist threw away the steel sword with the blade all broken.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then he put on a robe and walked towards me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, what’s up? When I asked you to fight before, you brushed me off saying you were busy. Have you changed your mind?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I crossed my legs while sitting on a steel chair.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was Velkist’s private training room located on the fourth floor.
 </p>

 <p>
  “…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  As I remained silent, Velkist furrowed his brows.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re not going to tell me you came here just for chit-chat.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can’t I come for chit-chat?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t be ridiculous.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist snorted and gulped down water.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked up. It seemed like Anytng had made up his mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was searching for help in the menu at the bottom.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment, the door of the training room opened and someone walked in.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oppa, you called for me?”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Hmm?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist’s eyes widened.
 </p>
 <p>
  Everyone had gathered.
 </p>
 <p>
  I stood up from the chair and closed the door of the training room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna tilted her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oppa Vel is here too. Are we going to reminisce about the old days?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is not the time to chit-chat.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You guys, you know the situation, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you mean the current situation… you mean preparing for war?”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Yes. The Master is selecting heroes and making weapons and airships.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even heroes who were unaware of the details could sense the changed atmosphere in the waiting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You mentioned there would be a large-scale battle on the 50th floor. So I’ve been honing my skills too! It seems like Oppa Vel is doing the same.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But you see, we’re short on resources.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It thought we had a lot. Do you mean we need more?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course. We need to double it. Only then can we manage.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But we don’t get much material from the weekly dungeon. What exactly are you suggesting…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna, who had been deep in thought, stiffened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oppa, don’t tell me… you’re suggesting we raid other waiting rooms’ storage?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If necessary, we might have to.”

  “That’s a bit…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m saying keep it in mind as the worst-case scenario. Piracy isn’t that efficient anyway.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I never claimed to be an honorable player.
 </p>
 <p>
  I discarded any users that interfered with my play.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Raid.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s not incorrect.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you lack something, you have to take it from others.
 </p>
 <p>
  But piracy doesn’t only involve other users.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are ruins.
 </p>
 <p>
  They are special places that appear in sectors where masters of similar levels reside.
 </p>

 <p>
  It’s simple.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you occupy those places, you can scoop up resources.
 </p>
 <p>
  And, naturally, there…
 </p>
 <p>
  Numerous masters are engaged in a free-for-all.
 </p>
 <p>
  “A war for the sake of war, huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As I finished explaining, Velkist laughed and threw away the empty water bottle.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sounds good.”

 <p>
  And the next afternoon.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Slowly! Come out slowly!”

 <p>
  From the hangar installed on the left side of the Dimensional Rift, the airship was moving.
 </p>
 <p>
  Radi, dressed in a yellow maintenance suit, was waving a signal stick, guiding the newly constructed airship, Lucette, towards the exit.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t be nervous. Breathe comfortably. Relax your hands!”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Yes, sir!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  The left wing of the Lucette hit the corner of the hangar and crumpled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Is it really safe?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna looked at me anxiously.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist, with two swords on his back, had his eyes closed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It will be safe. Probably.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Probably? I hate the idea of dying in a crash.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a loud noise, the Lucette came to a halt.
 </p>
 <p>
  A small airship, two levels smaller than Capitalism.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since we were going out in small numbers, this would be sufficient.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s gotten noisy here too.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was completely silent when it was first being made.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked to the right. Under Katiio’s command, the third airship was being built.

 <p>
  Dozens of technicians were assembling the basic frame of the airship with wood and metal.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;You can board now!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Clank. Clank.
 </p>
 <p>
  The stairs descended from the railing of the Lucette.
 </p>
 <p>
  I firmly gripped my spare sword sheath and stepped on the first step of the stairs.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Take care of the waiting room while I’m away.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa bowed politely.
 </p>
 <p>
  Beside her, Kishasha waved her hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Have a good trip, Han. I wanted to go too, but Goo Goo Con keeps begging me to play with him…”

 </p>
 <p>
  “No, Goo Goo! Stay still!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Guoo!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Kishasha strengthened her grip, the pigeon dangled from her fingertips.
 </p>
 <p>
  I laughed lightly and finished climbing the stairs.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Traitor! After I saved you, you abandoned me here!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Noisy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Someone seemed to be nagging, but I decided to ignore it.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Jenna finally boarded, the stairs went up and folded.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Lucette departing! Hold on tight!&gt;

 <p>
  Wooong.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Lucette, half-lifted from the ground, began moving toward the dimensional vortex.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha, holding the wriggling Goo Goo in her arms, exited the Dimensional Rift.
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa was watching me from inside the railing.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Get ready.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I whispered to Neryssa.
 </p>
 <p>
  She nodded lightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  5-star summon.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a big fight ahead, there was no time to delay.
 </p>
 <p>
  After the occupation battle, we planned to start immediately upon returning to the waiting room.

 <p>
  As the airship exited the tower, I gathered Jenna and Velkist in the cabin to begin the briefing for the occupation battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  When the fight begins, tens to hundreds of people will engage in a chaotic battle on the Ruin field.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We need a formation, right? It’s a triangle formation, isn’t it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Each of us has to handle a sector. Didn’t we practice this to death before?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Recently, I’ve been training alone a lot.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, that’s fine. There will be constant fighting, I mean.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Clank!
 </p>
 <p>
  The airship swayed sharply to the right.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Terrible piloting.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “She’s a novice.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The current pilot of the Lucette was Radi’s assistant.
 </p>
 <p>
  His current position was assistant mechanic. Since Radi couldn’t leave the waiting room due to airship construction, we had to bring along such a guy for navigation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t let your guard down just because we have time. Even approaching the Ruin could get us attacked.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Almost all Ruins had small or large battles.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether skirmishes or full-scale wars.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even briefly occupying it could yield great rewards.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s about time.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It had been several hours since the Lucette departed.
 </p>
 <p>
  It would take 30 to 40 minutes at most to reach the Ruin.

 <p>
  From my memory, this was a chaotic area where battles occurred simultaneously.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Hey!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  A hurried voice echoed through the ship’s speaker.
 </p>
 <p>
  I listened closely to the broadcast.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;We have spotted an approaching airship ahead!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna and Velkist’s expressions changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  I signaled to the two and went out to the deck.
 </p>
 <p>
  Half-drawing my sword from its sheath.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I reached the deck, a white dot was approaching from beyond the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  An airship from another faction.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-12" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  As I squinted, I could roughly see its outline.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A small, no, an ultra-small one?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The airship was getting closer.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ready for battle, I had to let go of my sword’s handle.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What is that.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Rumble.
 </p>
 <p>
  A tiny boat, like a fishing boat, was flying toward us.
 </p>
 <p>
  It didn’t have a cannon or even a ballista, and only one shabby-dressed woman was standing on its deck. In the corner, items that looked like supplies were piled up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The woman’s eyes met mine.
 </p>
 <p>
  She glanced at me indifferently and then turned her gaze away.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ultra-small airship passed by the Lucette.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What is that.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was definitely headed in the direction of the Ruin.
 </p>
 <p>
  On a battlefield, such an unarmed airship flying peacefully here?
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, in the corner of the boat, there were materials presumed to be loot.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Uh, well…&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ignore it and keep going.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The short girl in the cockpit nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…No way.’
 </p>

 <p>
  Several uneasy premonitions surfaced.
 </p>
 <p>
  That feeling intensified as we approached the Ruin.
 </p>
 <p>
  All the airships we encountered on the way were unarmed merchant ships.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though they must have seen us, they passed by without any combat posture.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some even greeted us.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Didn’t you say there would be constant fighting?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist looked back at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sky was clear, and airships were floating in the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no sound of cannon fire anywhere.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is it already solidly occupied?’
 </p>

 <p>
  Even so, there were no surveillance ships from other factions.
 </p>
 <p>
  In Niflheimr’s territory, surveillance airships could be found frequently.
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally, the Lucette approached right in front of the Ruin.
 </p>
 <p>
  A huge island floating in the sky. On top of it, a giant crystal dozens of meters in size was standing.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the Ruin field’s scenery.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, there were no high walls, no tight cannon networks, and no airships preparing for bombardment. Merchant ships were just coming and going along the harbor.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ding!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Lucette’ has arrived at Medium Ruin (847D)!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Ruin is currently occupied by the ‘Silver Star’ Guild. Would you like to check the guild details?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  What a sight.
 </p>
 <p>
  I laughed and said ‘Yes’.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Welcome to the healing and flower-scented paradise for light users!]

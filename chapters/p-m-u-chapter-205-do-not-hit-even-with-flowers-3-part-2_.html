  Anytng typed again: We need a lot, not a little.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng added that if they make an exception for me, he will repay them after clearing the 50th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Saechoom&gt; That’s quite a lot. ㅠ.ㅠ
 </p>
 <p>
  Saechoom&gt; It’s okay! I’ll talk to our guild members. They are all kind and not greedy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Saechoom&gt; However, there are reservations, so it might take some time for your turn to come!

 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng&gt; Hello! I’m a temporary guild member, nice to meet you.
 </p>
 <p>
  Saechoom&gt; This is the new member, Anytng! Please welcome him warmly~
 </p>
 <p>
  Nuruha&gt; Nice to meet you!
 </p>
 <p>
  MeowBark&gt; Hello~ Please take care of me~
 </p>
 <p>
  BlueRose&gt; Welcome.
 </p>
 <p>
  With this, there was no need to watch any further. I closed the chat screen in front of me and finished my tea.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, this…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna and Velkist were looking into the air. They could figure out the situation as well. We had steadily raised the research levels.

  Clunk.
 </p>
 <p>
  The door to the accommodation opened, and Adilung entered with a broad smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Welcome to the family, everyone!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It feels a bit awkward now, but with time…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We can’t stay long.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s okay! Please feel at home.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Adilung placed a tray with three sandwiches and milk in front of us, bowed, and left.
 </p>
 <p>
  He seemed to be treating us to a meal.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna looked between me and Velkist.

 <p>
  “If they were going to attack, wouldn’t they have done it already? I think it’s safe to trust them. Not everyone is bad.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Calling us family is ridiculous.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist scoffed.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “As you can see, the master has made a decision.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “To compromise?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not a compromise, it’s goodwill! We don’t have to kill unnecessarily.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s better not to fight. Well, we need time, so we’ll wait and take what we can.”

  According to the chat between Anytng and Saechoom, there’s a queue for distributing resources from the ruin. Of course, since Anytng was the last to join, we were at the bottom. The resources in the ruin are restored every few days, so in real time, we’d have to wait at least a month.
 </p>
 <p>
  A month of waiting.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is that your choice?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I decided not to give any opinions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Adilung offered us accommodation in the villa. We could train in the outer ruins while waiting.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if we get resources, it will not be enough. To increase the number of heroes by hundreds and produce airships, we’d need to sweep all the resources from the ruin.
 </p>
 <p>
  This, the 50th floor is going to be tough.
 </p>
 <p>
  The next morning.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was drinking tea on the first floor of the villa.
 </p>
 <p>
  Outside, heroes were gathering resources.

 <p>
  They were materials obtainable from the weekly dungeon. The important rare items could only be obtained from the crystal over there.
 </p>
 <p>
  Slurp.
 </p>
 <p>
  I drank half of my green tea and looked ahead.
 </p>
 <p>
  Adilung was having a conversation with a middle-aged man at the counter.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s our turn this time. Please check the ledger.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, confirmed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  The door burst open, and someone entered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Adil!”

  A woman with brown skin and a blue ponytail walked in. She had a well-balanced figure and a sword at her waist.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We need to get a compromise this time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Men armed with weapons followed her.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What? You guys got a concession last time!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The master needs it, what can we do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Excuse me, but we’ve been waiting for three months…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sir, be quiet for a moment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The woman placed her arms on the counter.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You know, our ‘Silver Star Vigilantes’ maintain the peace here. What if we weaken and an enemy invades? We can’t let 24, or rather 25 masters, end up on the streets. Isn’t that right, weak sir?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well…”

  “Your turn will come soon. We just need a concession this one time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Alright.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The middle-aged man lowered his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, it’s a concession. Let it be our turn this time. Put a stamp on the ledger. Got it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t forget who shed the most blood during the liberation war. While we were fighting, your master was just sitting behind, twiddling his thumbs. And now…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The woman’s lips moved quietly.
 </p>
 <p>
  She didn’t say it out loud, but I could tell.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Parasites.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I finished my tea.
 </p>
 <p>
  The shoulders of the middle-aged man slumped.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I know… We did nothing, so… we will wait for our turn.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The man left the villa.
 </p>
 <p>
  The woman smiled thinly, handed the ledger to Adilung, and winked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then again next time!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As she was about to leave, her eyes fell on me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh, that man…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The new family member I mentioned yesterday.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Family, my ass.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Watch your language!”

 </p>
 <p>
  “That man looks familiar. Was it in Dimension City… Maybe not, never mind.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The woman and her group left the villa.
 </p>
 <p>
  Adilung looked at me with a bitter expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m sorry. You had to see such an ugly scene. They weren’t like this before…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They’ve changed, then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. But we can’t protect this ruin without them. They are necessary members.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Necessary people.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled.

 <p>
  Anytng&gt; Hello! I’m a temporary guild member, but please take care of me.
 </p>

 <p>
  Saecheorom&gt; Welcome ^^.
 </p>
 <p>
  YaoingMeongMeong&gt; Nice to meet you~
 </p>
 <p>
  Ggalkkemi&gt; Welcome, newbie!
 </p>
 <p>
  That evening.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Anytng logged into Pick Me Up and greeted, a few guild members welcomed him.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were genuine herbivore users.
 </p>
 <p>
  They had minimal combat ability since they had climbed to the 40th floor, but they had now given up climbing and were focused on running the waiting room, nurturing heroes, and decorating.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were various reasons for giving up the missions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because it was not fun. Because they felt the limits of climbing. Because they felt sorry for the heroes dying. Because decorating was fun…
 </p>
 <p>
  Anyway, they were also among the diverse users enjoying Pick Me Up.
 </p>
 <p>
  BlueRose&gt; By the way, did you see the new flower decoration in the shop? It’s so pretty.
 </p>
 <p>
  MilkLove33&gt; You mean the daffodil?
 </p>
 <p>
  BlueRose&gt; Yes, that one. It would look perfect in the garden! It’s only 300 gems per tile. My heroes love it ^^;
 </p>
 <p>
  300 gems per tile is ridiculously expensive.
 </p>
 <p>
  If they feels it’s cheap, then so be it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lakshumi&gt; Does anyone have the 5-story circular waiting room model? I want to expand and follow it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Saecheorom&gt; I have it. Give me your email, and I’ll send the file.
 </p>
 <p>
  The guild chat was constantly filled with such conversations.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  There was hardly any combat-related information.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mostly, it was about decorating the waiting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since Pick Me Up has a well-set system for customizing the waiting room, diving into it can be as fun as combat.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the other hand, there were a few members who differed from this atmosphere.
 </p>
 <p>
  The vigilante members. They never greet when they log in. Even if someone asked a question about heroes or missions, they ignored it or brushed it off.
 </p>
 <p>
  Occasionally, their conversations went like this:
 </p>
 <p>
  Melt&gt; Hey
 </p>
 <p>
  DyDie&gt; Yeah
 </p>
 <p>
  Melt&gt; Come in
 </p>
 <p>
  DyDIE&gt; Yeah
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  They would throw out cryptic messages in the guild chat.
 </p>
 <p>
  Probably, “come in” meant a private chat channel for a smaller group.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, whatever happens with the Silver Star Guild or whatever they do, I don’t care as long as we get our share.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng seemed to think similarly, as he rarely participated in guild chat except when logging in or out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then one day.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Edis was about to send me an update report.
 </p>
 <p>
  Melt&gt; Anytng, are you there?
 </p>
 <p>
  A core member of the vigilante team called out Anytng in the guild chat.
 </p>
 <p>
  I stopped writing the letter to Edith.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng&gt; Yes.
 </p>

 <p>
  Melt&gt; Sorry, but I have something urgent to tell you. Can you come over?
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ding!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Melt’ has invited you to the private chat channel ‘Silver Star Vigilante’. Do you accept?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  I put down the pen.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like something was happening.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you there?”
 </p>
 <p>
  There was a knock on the door.
 </p>
 <p>
  Followed by the sound of someone pacing outside.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna and Velkist had gone out for evening training, leaving me alone in the room.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  “Isn’t this Israt of Townia? I have something to say. Can you open the door?”
 </p>
 <p>
  When I opened the door, a brown-skinned woman dressed in leather armor appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  She was the female warrior who had pushed aside the middle-aged man a few days ago, claiming priority.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her name was Sijar Mekne.
 </p>
 <p>
  She was the sub-master of Melt, the leader of the vigilante team.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Phew, lucky you were here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sijar strode into the room and sat on the sofa.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then she looked up at me and spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You are the winner of the Dimensional City, right? The so-called mad dog who swept through dozens alone. I also participated in that tournament. I didn’t do well… but I saw you fight in the battle royale and solo matches. Cracking the ground with a single strike.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So what?”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Join the vigilante team. No, to be precise, the guild we are about to form.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sijar began to speak.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Our master also recognized your value. He’s probably talking to your master about it now. Honestly, aren’t you tired of playing nanny to weaklings and cleaning up after them?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “At first, I thought it was okay. But as time went by, I realized this wasn’t it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sijar’s blue eyes darkened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just before you guys arrived, this place was attacked. Twenty-three Silver Star members died. But all the dead were from the vigilante team. Do you know why? Because no other masters sent reinforcements!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Bastards. Do they even know how many died to capture this place? Many more died protecting the ruin afterwards. Weapons, troops, airships. We provided everything. They just sucked their thumbs and whined about the resources we took to make up for our losses, saying it was unfair.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed.

 <p>
  I stroked the warhorse statue.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed I didn’t have to wait long.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re going to topple them all.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sijar said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The ones who only want to take advantage while claiming weakness. Those who refuse to take on any dangerous tasks, shaking their heads. The bastards who bow in front but stab us in the back. These the ones we’re against. So, help us.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No thanks.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No thanks.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Simultaneously, Anytng responded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng&gt; No, thanks.
 </p>

 <p>
  I understood the situation well.
 </p>
 <p>
  Being weak doesn’t necessarily mean being good.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some people mistake kindness for entitlement.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the water bottle on the desk.
 </p>
 <p>
  A flower was stuck in it. It was a gift from a hero of some master as a joining present.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then… you’re willing to give up resources for such guys despite having the strength?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What nonsense.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then why?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Go back. I’ve heard enough complaints.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you join us, we will give you priority for resources.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Leave.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I reached for the sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sijar’s expression hardened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Take your lackeys hiding behind the door with you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…You’ll regret it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s not your concern.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sijar glanced at me and then left.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng exited the Silver Star vigilante’s private chat immediately after.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Ridiculous.’
 </p>
 <p>
  To drag us into such petty political fights.

 <p>
  I looked out the window. Sijar and the vigilante members were leaving the quarters.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oops!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The window suddenly opened, and Jenna nimbly jumped in.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, that’s what was happening!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “When did you come?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve been here for a while. I saw some suspicious people heading this way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna walked over to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I guess I had false hopes. It would’ve been easier to fight from the start.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Indeed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, what will you do, Oppa?”
 </p>

 <p>
  I threw the letter I was writing to Edis into the trash can.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then I picked up the flower on the water bottle.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a slight force, the flower’s stem snapped.
 </p>
 <p>
  I threw the broken flower into the trash as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, I figured it would come to this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There will be a vigilante stronghold near the crystal.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll find out the structure.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Inform Velkist too. Get ready.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aye aye!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I clicked my tongue.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Annoying bastards.’
 </p>
 <p>
  They’ve just wasted my precious time.

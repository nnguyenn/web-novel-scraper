 <p>
  The second-floor lodging of the villa.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was looking out the window.

 <p>
  Two young girls were playing with flowers in the meadow, where various flowers were in full bloom.
 </p>
 <p>
  The girls, who looked to be in their mid-teens at most, were throwing flowers at each other and laughing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Behind them, a young man from the vigilante team, carrying a spear, was watching over them.
 </p>
 <p>
  A dramatic, peaceful moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  I shifted my gaze to the desk.
 </p>
 <p>
  A withered flower was floating in a water bottle.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s a dream.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Adilung had said.
 </p>
 <p>
  He wanted to protect this paradise forever.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was willing to make any sacrifice for it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A dream, huh.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s good to have a dream.
 </p>
 <p>
  Life without a dream is too bleak.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially in a place as crazy as this.
 </p>
 <p>
  Most of the masters in the Silver Star Guild had given up climbing the tower.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were focusing on decorating their waiting rooms, enjoying the game in their own way.
 </p>
 <p>
  In fact, there were more of this type in Pick Me Up. As you climbed the tower, the waiting room got bigger, and there were dozens of things to manage. Hardly anyone studied thick books just to play the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Are you happy?’
 </p>

 <p>
  I looked at the two girls laughing.
 </p>
 <p>
  They must be happy.
 </p>
 <p>
  They don’t have to fight monsters.
 </p>
 <p>
  They don’t need to do harsh training.
 </p>
 <p>
  The risk of synthesis is almost nonexistent.
 </p>
 <p>
  To them, this world would appear as a paradise on a higher dimension, not a hell where life and death come and go several times a day.
 </p>
 <p>
  Come to think of it, I remember Jenna’s words when Anytng hadn’t logged in for a long time.
 </p>
 <p>
  She said it wouldn’t be bad even if the master didn’t come.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Does she still think that way?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled lightly.

 <p>
  It was the afternoon, not long before evening.
 </p>
 <p>
  The twilight was faintly shining over the towering crystal.
 </p>
 <p>
  It had been a few days since then, and our turn was still the last.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng logged in early for the first time in a while, and the guild chat was still buzzing with conversations from the pacifist users.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They’re here.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Footsteps were heard coming down the wooden corridor.
 </p>
 <p>
  I closed the curtain.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  The old wooden door was roughly opened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I need an answer today.”
 </p>

 <p>
  A woman with a single-edged sword slung diagonally across her body stood at the door.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sijal, the captain of the vigilante team.
 </p>
 <p>
  She kept coming here, despite being rejected.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aren’t you tired of this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Think of it as sincerity.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Isn’t the atmosphere a bit too rough to call it sincerity?
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked past Sijal. Several armed members of the vigilante team were glaring at me in the hallway.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed they wanted to intimidate me. It was rather cute.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you join the vigilante team, I can guarantee you a good position. I know you’re strong. We don’t plan to stay on the 40th floor. We’re going higher. If you join us, you’ll receive a lot of help. I can guarantee it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Such noisy nagging.
 </p>

 <p>
  I toyed with the wooden horse figurine on the desk.
 </p>
 <p>
  I wanted to draw my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  But it’s not the time yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You are… Ha, forget it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After babbling alone for about ten minutes, Sijal looked at me with weary eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stay here for the rest of your life. Let’s how long will it take for your turn to come.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sijal snorted and left with the vigilante team.
 </p>
 <p>
  If she wanted to conquer this place so badly, she had plenty of chances before.
 </p>
 <p>
  She seemed reluctant to do it, despite her disgust.
 </p>
 <p>
  *Trickster93&gt; Why are you rejecting it?*
 </p>

 <p>
  Meanwhile, a noisy master had intruded into Anytng’s chat.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was a member of the vigilante team and had been incessantly chatting after Anytng refused to join.
 </p>
 <p>
  *Trickster93&gt; Your hero is super strong. Isn’t that Israt guy famous? You don’t need to help much. Just lend us that guy, and we’ll handle the rest.*
 </p>
 <p>
  *Anytng&gt; Sorry, I’m not interested.*
 </p>
 <p>
  *Trickster93&gt; Are you scared?*
 </p>
 <p>
  *Anytng&gt; Yes. I can’t afford to get hurt here.*
 </p>
 <p>
  *Trickster93&gt; LOL, unbelievable.*
 </p>
 <p>
  The chat continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  *Trickster93&gt; You’re a girl, right?*
 </p>
 <p>
  *Anytng&gt; What?*
 </p>

 <p>
  *Trickster93&gt; You’re a girl? You seem super scared. I’ve seen your videos on MyTube, and you didn’t do much. Your hero is carrying you. Aren’t you just a typical girl gamer who got lucky? I didn’t expect to find one even here, LOL. You even get carried by a virtual character, LOL.*
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng didn’t respond.
 </p>
 <p>
  I started rolling the wooden horse figurine in my hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  *Trickster93&gt; Do you think you amount to anything because your hero wins events? Have you done anything properly? If I were that hero’s master, I would already be a ranker.*
 </p>
 <p>
  *Trickster93&gt; Stop rejecting and lend him to us. LOL. We’ll show you how to use him. You can’t handle him with your skills.*
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang.
 </p>
 <p>
  The closed door opened again.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t Sijal, Jenna, or Velkist who appeared, but a skinny, bony man.
 </p>
 <p>
  The man, with a gaunt appearance, had two daggers at his waist.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This must be Trickster93’s hero.’

 <p>
  Perfect timing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The master has a message for you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll get straight to the point. Your master is incompetent. Join us. Don’t you want to work under a capable master?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The paint on the wooden horse figurine chipped a bit from my grip.
 </p>
 <p>
  *Trickster93&gt; If you’re a girl, you should just play with flowers like the others. Why pretend to be a ranker? You’re in the perfect place, so why act different? You’d get along well with that flower maniac Blue Rose.*
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng remained silent.
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t speak to the man in front of me either.
 </p>
 <p>
  “At least pretend to listen when someone talks. You have no manners. Even though you’re the winner of a major tournament, you’re just a coward.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stop fiddling with that useless figurine!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The man knocked the figurine out of my left hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crash.
 </p>
 <p>
  The head of the wooden horse figurine smashed horribly as it hit the floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ding!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have blocked ‘Trickster93’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you ready to talk now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s good…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Before he could finish, the blade of my sword was driven into his left shoulder.

 <p>
  A man clumsily thrust a spear at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I easily deflected the spear and plunged my sword deep into his abdomen.

 <p>
  His eyes widened in disbelief. Kicking him, he tumbled backwards and soon stopped moving.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There sure are a lot of them.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a guild with 24 masters.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if each user sent five heroes, there were well over a hundred.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Pacifist users sure are stingy with their troops.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Most of those blocking our way seemed like they had never held a sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Who knows what they were told, but even heroes outside the vigilante teams had started to step in. They were probably told that they couldn’t protect it alone and would lose everything if they didn’t join in.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You evil bastards!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Another similar guy charged at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I stabbed my sword into one fallen man while simultaneously pulling out a dagger with my left hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The swiftly thrown dagger pierced his throat.
 </p>
 <p>
  He collapsed, clutching his neck.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dead.
 </p>
 <p>
  From level 40, PVP protection does not apply.
 </p>
 <p>
  In other words, dying here meant it was truly the end.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nevertheless, Silver Star’s heroes kept swarming in.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, our task was clear.

 <p>
  We just had to deal with the moths that were rushing at us.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why are you doing this! Is there some special reason!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I heard Adilung’s voice from beyond the screams and shouts.
 </p>
 <p>
  A special reason.
 </p>
 <p>
  Why don’t you look for it in your grave?
 </p>
 <p>
  [There are 211 unread guild chat messages. Would you like to check them?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes / No (select)]
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng ignored the guild chat completely.
 </p>
 <p>
  Negotiations were already over.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t let them into the fortress! Stop them by any means!”

 <p>
  “Geez, just barking orders from behind.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist chuckled as he slit the throat of a swordsman.
 </p>
 <p>
  A silver flash, and the two men awkwardly standing beside him met the same fate.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were cut down without even having the chance to swing their swords properly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s a lot of them, but they’re just a messy rabble.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They’ve never fought properly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna twirled the dagger in her left hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Blood from the corpses below splattered on the blade.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Die! Please!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A disheveled woman rushed at me.

  She was holding a broken dagger in a torn dress.
 </p>
 <p>
  I dodged her thrust by turning to the left.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We were living peac…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud.
 </p>
 <p>
  The woman collapsed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Pathetic.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In a siege, you should concentrate your firepower.
 </p>
 <p>
  This isn’t a tournament, yet they come at us one by one.
 </p>
 <p>
  Those in the distance just watched, only a handful actually approached.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you don’t want to fight, move aside!”

 <p>
  Sijal and the vigilantes pushed through the spectators.
 </p>
 <p>
  Their well-fitted armor straps and gleaming blades marked them as Silver Star’s elite.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite facing a battle, they showed no signs of panic.
 </p>
 <p>
  It meant they had quite a bit of combat experience.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just over 50.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna whispered in my ear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sijal bared her teeth at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I should have known you I verified that you were really the Mad Dog.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It would be troublesome to fight here.
 </p>
 <p>
  These weren’t all the heroes in this place.

  I signaled Jenna and Velkist with my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  They seemed to understand my intention and nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, why are they coming here!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Slash.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist, leading the charge, beheaded one of them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gripping his sword long, Velkist swung it mercilessly left and right.
 </p>
 <p>
  Limbs of the heroes caught in his trajectory flew into the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This… this madman…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Breakthrough! Head for the fortress!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [A siege has begun!]

 </p>
 <p>
  The left side of the encirclement was breached.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were just clueless amateurs; this was simple.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not so fast!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  A transparent wall blocked my path.
 </p>
 <p>
  Adilung’s defensive magic.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not really.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I gathered my strength and swung my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crash!

 <p>
  The sound of breaking glass accompanied the shattering wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  I discarded the broken sword in my hand and took a spare one from Velkist.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We take the fortress. Velkist, lead the way. I’ll be in the middle. Jenna, cover the rear.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, sir!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna’s hand moved, leaving an afterimage.
 </p>
 <p>
  From her short bow, arrows rained down on the vigilantes at the rear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ping! Ping ping ping!
 </p>
 <p>
  Several heroes struck by the blind arrows fell to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Contact the fortress! Lock the gates and send up the troops!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yaaargh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I punched a guy who charged at me with a scream.
 </p>
 <p>
  He fell, blood pouring from his nose.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They’re coming!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I know.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Heroes of Silver Star were descending the slope leading to the crystal.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dozens of them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not just that.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They’re totally pissed off.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked around.
 </p>
 <p>
  Heroes were moving from the harbor on the outskirts of the field.

 <p>
  The pilot’s voice echoed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Lucette was docked there too.
 </p>
 <p>
  I brought my hand to my ear.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Launch the airship and send it this way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;But what’s happening? They seemed like nice people!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Leave the driving to the autopilot. Load the cannon and shoot anyone who approaches.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Huh? What kind of crap…!&gt;

 <p>
  Vroom.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Lucette began to lift off from the dock.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  Fire spewed from the Lucette’s cannon.
 </p>
 <p>
  Several heroes heading towards the dock turned to ash.
 </p>
 <p>
  The bodies Velkist had dealt with rolled down the hill.
 </p>
 <p>
  Beyond the hill, the huge crystal and surrounding walls came into view.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They’ve already fortified it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Cannons and ballistae atop the fortress walls were aimed our way.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ready to fire the moment we were in range.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, Oppa! This is strange! They’re heading somewhere else!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna pointed to the dock.
 </p>
 <p>
  Three medium-sized airships were rising into the air from a corner of the dock.
 </p>
 <p>
  Armored and armed with cannons, they were warships.
 </p>
 <p>
  But their prows were facing the opposite direction.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were moving outside the ruins.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They’re heading to attack the main base.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The target was the waiting room of Anytng.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is why I hate Pacifist.’
 </p>
 <p>
  They should just fight for the ruins, but they insist on turning it into a full-blown war.
 </p>
 <p>
  This fight won’t end with just capturing the ruin.
 </p>
 <p>
  They’ll come after our main base for revenge or whatever.
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s only one way.
 </p>
 <p>
  As always, we have to annihilate them,
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom! Boom boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  One of Silver Star’s airships heading out of the fortress burst into flames and crashed. It wasn’t the Lucette’s doing.
 </p>
 <p>
  They came after all.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bandits circling the ruin waiting for an opportunity.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a fleet of PVP users.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  Silver Star’s second airship exploded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Caught off guard, they had no chance to resist.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were indiscriminately bombarding even the evacuation airships fleeing the ruin.
 </p>
 <p>
  The left gate of the fortress opened, and cavalry rushed out in a panic.
 </p>
 <p>
  They didn’t even glance our way, heading straight for the harbor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course.
 </p>
 <p>
  If those guys land, things will get ten times more complicated.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s no longer one-on-one.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a one-on-one-on-one, it’s impossible to tell front from back.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But that’s their problem.’
 </p>

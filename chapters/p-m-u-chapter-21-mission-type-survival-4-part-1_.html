 <p>
  Zeeth and Hanson’s lifeless bodies were buried among the horde of goblins, concealed from sight.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hundreds, even thousands, of pairs of crimson eyes, stared menacingly in our direction.

  “Jenna, do you see the wall behind us?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, I do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Climb that wall.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Getting pressured by the waves of beasts, we find ourselves pressed against a towering barrier, with the building’s roof sprawling above.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna stole a quick glance behind her.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But if I climb up, I’ll be running alone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who said you would? Once you’re up, I’ll follow. Then it’s Aaron’s turn. You go first, and extend your hand to help.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron’s condition was beyond words.
 </p>
 <p>
  He wanted to say something, but he was denied the breath to speak, so he gasped for air.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They’re coming! Aaron, hold your ground!” I shouted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll lead go first!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna begins her ascent up the stone wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kyaaaah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A swarm of goblins descended upon us. I swung my weapon in an arc, revealing the vulnerability of their chests, while Aaron wielded his spear with rugged determination.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Avoid thrusting! One at a time!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I parried their attacks with my shield, then stroke back.
 </p>
 <p>
  The number of goblins we had to face multiplied significantly. Despite my best efforts, I couldn’t block or evade them all. Wounds begin to appear, marking my body.

 <p>
  “I’ve made it up! Hurry!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m going!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Exerting every ounce of strength, I deliver sweeping strikes. The goblins were torn asunder.
 </p>
 <p>
  Without delay, I hinged and climbed up the stone wall. There were crevices scattered about, offering footings.
 </p>
 <p>
  [03:12]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aaron, follow up!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, Aaron! Can’t you hear me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, Aaron snapped back to reality and turned toward me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, I’m sorry. I-I’m coming, I’m coming!”

 <p>
  “Give me your hand.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna reaches out her hand. I grasp her hand, stained with both blood and weariness and ascend onto the roof. Aaron hurried to climb up below.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Take my hand.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I extend my hand from the rooftop.
 </p>
 <p>
  In that fleeting moment when Aaron seized my hand and attempts to ascend…
 </p>
 <p>
  “AAAUGH!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron lets out a pained groan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “….”
 </p>
 <p>
  A blade embedded itself in Aaron’s calf.
 </p>
 <p>
  The blade was deeply lodged within a crevice of the wall.

  “I… I can’t…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jenna, hold onto Aaron.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I grabbed the edge of the roof and descended to the wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you trying to do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m cutting off his foot. If I cut it off, we can pull him up right away.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “….Got it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With my left hand holding onto the roof, I swung my right sword forcefully.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s not a comfortable position to put strength into, but I have to cut it in one strike. I recalled the feeling of cutting down a straw scarecrow with a single blow.
 </p>
 <p>
  “AUUUUGHHHH!”
 </p>
 <p>
  One of Aaron’s legs, splattering blood, fell to the ground.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Pull him up!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna held Aaron’s right hand with both hands and pulled him up.
 </p>
 <p>
  The hot blood flowing from the severed leg stained her face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Phew.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I spat out the blood that entered my mouth and climbed back onto the roof.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Aaron (★)’ has suffered bleeding. His stamina decreasing.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron seemed to have no strength left, and he collapsed on the roof.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had no time to waste, I quickly stood up and looked below the roof.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You got to be kidding me?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Countless goblins had gathered below the roof.
 </p>

 <p>
  When our eyes met, the goblins looked up at us and chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are they giving up?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You think they would?”
 </p>
 <p>
  One goblin toppled over. Another goblin climbed on top of it. The goblins started building a pyramid.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow, they’re smart.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They’re smart my ass!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The goblin at the very top managed to find a foothold in the crevices of the stone wall. Gradually, step by step, the goblin that constructed the makeshift stairs climbed up the wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  I surveyed the roof, its worn surface strewn with broken bricks. Without hesitation, I hurled a brick at the goblin below.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kuaaack!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The goblin took a direct hit to the face and plummeted to its demise.

 </p>
 <p>
  [01:58]
 </p>
 <p>
  …
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon we even ran off bricks to throw.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, goblins were emerging from all directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna tightened her grip on her dagger.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Aaron (★)’ has entered a critical state and is at risk of losing his life!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron was laying limp, his condition worsening.
 </p>
 <p>
  He wasn’t dead yet, but it wouldn’t be long. The bleeding was severe.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Use Aaron’s spear. Stab them as they come!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna held the dagger’s blade between her index and middle fingers, launching it at a goblin. The dagger found its mark, piercing the goblin’s forehead.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seizing the spear, Jenna began thrusting downward. I, too, raised my sword and mercilessly struck at the climbing goblins.
 </p>
 <p>
  The goblins at the top used those beneath them as stepping stones to descend. However, there were more goblins climbing up than falling down.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Nowhere else to run…’
 </p>
 <p>
  I kicked away the goblin trying to grab my hand, scanning the surroundings.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Damn it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Other rooftops had already been seized by the goblins. They glowed with crimson eyes, fixated on us.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kiyaaaa!” Jenna shouted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What happened? Did you get stabbed?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I quickly looked back.
 </p>
 <p>
  It would be dangerous if Jenna fell here. I couldn’t fend off the enemy on my own.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna was clenching her right hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  She wasn’t injured, but she had lost her grip on the spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I lost the spear.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll make them regret it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do we do now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What can we do? Kick them and knock them down!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna leaned her body against the sloping rooftop, delivering powerful kicks to the approaching goblins’ faces. With cries of pain, they tumbled to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  [01:24]

 <p>
  “Eeek! Eeek!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dozens of hands surged from beneath the roof, grasping their weapons. Green flesh was sliced, blood flowed, yet the goblins paid no heed as they climbed higher, and pulled their weapons closer.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Clang!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Unfortunately, I lost my sword. The weapon vanished, consumed by the sea of goblins.
 </p>
 <p>
  Only a blood-stained shield remained.
 </p>
 <p>
  I struck at the hands reaching onto the roof with the edge of the shield. Severed goblin fingers sprayed blood as they flew through the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There are too many! How much longer? I can’t hold on any longer!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “30 seconds, just 30 seconds!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It feels like an hour has passed!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s true, trust me, and hold on a little longer!”

  [00:32]
 </p>
 <p>
  My vision grew hazy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Blood covered my right eye, impairing my sight.
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t distinguish whether it was my blood or the goblins’.
 </p>
 <p>
  My body pleaded for rest.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Now, take a moment to rest. You’ve given your all and more.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I had to bite down hard to come back to my senses the moment I heard this whisper in my ear.
 </p>
 <p>
  I summoned all my remaining mental strength, refusing to succumb to weakness.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dying here was not an option. I had my own sense of pride. I had to at least clear the 5th floor, just a little longer!
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally, a goblin managed to set foot on the roof.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swiftly, I struck its temple with the edge of my shield. It tumbled down, swinging its sword, and deeply cut my right arm, blood splattering out.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★)’ is bleeding. Stamina decreasing.]
 </p>
 <p>
  It was senseless.
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t understand why I had to endure such hardship in this place. Back on Earth, none of this ever happened. I slept in a warm comfortable bed and enjoyed delicious meals.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then why is this happening now?!
 </p>
 <p>
  Why did I come here?!
 </p>
 <p>
  Why did they summon me to fight monsters?
 </p>
 <p>
  Why me?
 </p>
 <p>
  Why Me?!
 </p>
 <p>
  WHY ME?!!!!

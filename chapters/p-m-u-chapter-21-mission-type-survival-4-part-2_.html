 <p>
  “You damn bastards!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I hurled my shield at the goblin climbing up.
 </p>

 <p>
  A weak scream came from beside me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kiyaa!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Jenna (★)’ is bleeding. Stamina decreases at regular intervals.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re still alive?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m okay, I can hold on.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A dagger was lodged in Jenna’s side.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her dress was stained red.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron showed signs of shock. His body was trembling, and blood intermittently spurted from his severed leg.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wouldn’t be surprising if he didn’t make it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t die! Just hold on until it’s over! Then we can go back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But… I think this is as far as I can go…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shut up! We won’t lose!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t hold them off any longer.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dozens of goblins swarmed onto the roof.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Retreat! Inside the roof, go inside!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But there’s no space inside!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just go!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sensation faded from my right arm.
 </p>

 <p>
  I felt light-headed, the world spinning around me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ker-ker, kerlarlak!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you want to kill me? Come on, come in, all of you, you bastards!”
 </p>
 <p>
  No sword, no shield.
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t even tell how many seconds were left.
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t spare a thought for Jenna’s situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kyaaah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dozens of goblins charged at me simultaneously.
 </p>
 <p>
  Their blood-soaked blades aimed to tear me apart.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then…
 </p>

  [00:00]
 </p>
 <p>
  As if time had frozen, the goblins’ movement broke as well as their blades pointed at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stage Clear!]
  <br/>
  [‘Han (★)’, ‘Jenna (★)’, ‘Aaron (★)’ level up!]
  <br/>
  [Reward – 30,000G, Iron Ore (B) x3, Leather (B) x2, Cardboard (B) x2]
  <br/>
  [MVP – ‘Han (★)’]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The decimated cityscape, the horde of goblins, and the lifeless bodies of Zeeth and Hanson all vanished in a radiant beam of light.
 </p>
 <p>
  A gentle white light enveloped my entire body, healing my wounds. Sensation returned to my arm, my lungs regained their rhythm, and torn muscles repaired themselves.
 </p>
 <p>
  The dagger embedded in Jenna’s side fell to the ground, and fresh flesh sprouted from Aaron’s severed leg.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, ahahahat.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna let out a hollow laugh, sinking to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can you hold my hand? My legs won’t support me.”
 </p>

 <p>
  I wordlessly extended my hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna grasped it, wobbling a few times before managing to rise.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did… we make it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a familiar room.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Climb the Tower, Save the World!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Main Dungeon: Current Floor – 5]
 </p>
 <p>
  The message on the left mirror signaled our clearance of the floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  The familiar hum filled the air as the waiting room began to rise.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron was still laying on the floor.

 <p>
  Though unconscious, his breathing remained steady.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had made it through.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is it like this from the 5th floor onward? If so, this is…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This time was different.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I reflected on the battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  Three divided passages. Swarming goblins.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a structure where the failure of even one person would lead to total annihilation. If only we had trained Zeeth and Hanson a bit more, we wouldn’t have had to fight so desperately.
 </p>
 <p>
  Surviving the mission wasn’t too difficult once a good party was formed. It was just unfortunate that we got caught in such a vulnerable moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  I picked up the iron sword and shield lying on the floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even the blood-soaked equipment had been miraculously restored.

 <p>
  “This is just too much! If I had known it would be like this, I would have trained harder!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna muttered, hanging her bow and quiver on her back.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her voice sounded cheerful, but her face told a different story.
 </p>
 <p>
  She got stabbed and almost died.
 </p>
 <p>
  Zeeth and Hanson had perished.
 </p>
 <p>
  And I ended up cutting Aaron’s leg.
 </p>
 <p>
  …
 </p>
 <p>
  As we emerged into the square, Deca rushed over as if he had been waiting.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hyung-nim, well done!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Silently, I made my way to the lodging.
 </p>

  “Are Zeeth and Hanson inside? Chloe said she had prepared something delicious.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They’re dead.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They’re gone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Deca stood frozen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ignoring him, I entered the lodging.
 </p>
 <p>
  A few people in the lobby glanced at me. I gently laid Aaron on the sofa and placed the spear beside him. His wounds had healed, but he didn’t regain consciousness immediately.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Master is calling. The chosen one shall come forth!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle’s voice echoed through the square.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed Anytng was trying to form a sub-party for the lower floors.

 <p>
  “My head is pounding.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I had no intention of dwelling on the loss of someone in the waiting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a place like this, especially for someone like me at the forefront of the Tower, death was a daily occurrence. But the throbbing in my head couldn’t be ignored.
 </p>
 <p>
  I opened the door at the end of the corridor and stepped inside. It was my assigned room in the lodging. I had grown accustomed to this place, even though it was far from a modern home.
 </p>
 <p>
  I collapsed onto the bed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Congratulations, Master! You have successfully cleared the 5th floor. The Weekly Dungeon is now open. Gather various materials to strengthen the waiting room and heroes.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A message appeared, announcing the opening of the Weekly Dungeon after clearing the 5th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come to think of it, I acquired the Fury skill…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Composure and Fury couldn’t coexist.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was an evident bug.
 </p>
 <p>
  Composure kept me rational in any situation, while Fury sacrificed rationality for heightened combat prowess.
 </p>
 <p>
  It must be linked to my unique nature as a Master and a Hero.
 </p>
 <p>
  I still didn’t have all the answers. At least for today, I didn’t want to dwell on it.
 </p>
 <p>
  From tomorrow, things would get busy again.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had reached level 10, the limit for a 1-star rating, and the Weekly Dungeon, where I could obtain valuable materials, had opened. It was time to aim for a 2-star promotion.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, let’s take today off.
 </p>
 <p>
  I closed my eyes.

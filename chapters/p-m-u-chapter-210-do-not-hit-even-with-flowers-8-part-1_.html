 <p>
  I was sitting on a large rock.
 </p>
 <p>
  The backlash from the Soulblade Fusion had turned the sword into powder, and even the sturdy leather armor was in tatters.

 <p>
  My body was in a terrible state as well. Even with the defensive effects of the Black Dragon Scale, I had suffered penalties from Ascend and the Soulblade Fusion, and had fallen from a height of several tens of meters at super speed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Still…’
 </p>
 <p>
  I had achieved the goal of drawing attention and causing a disturbance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna and Velkist had entered the underground of the ruins.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked down.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ground of the field, which was once lush with grass, was overturned.
 </p>
 <p>
  The place where I had fallen had turned into a small crater as if a meteor had struck, and fragments of shattered rocks were scattered around it.
 </p>
 <p>
  This wasn’t just a disturbance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even finding a corpse was difficult.
 </p>
 <p>
  Human flesh would likely have turned into ashes and disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What the hell…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned to the side.
 </p>
 <p>
  Far off, the heroes who had been squabbling near the barricade were now staring at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  They had even forgotten to swing their weapons.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Eek…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The man who made eye contact with me turned pale.
 </p>
 <p>
  He started to back away slowly, then turned and fled in a panic.
 </p>
 <p>
  His companions did the same. Dozens of heroes who had been attacking the Silver Star’s guild fled towards the fortress en masse.

  I sighed and got up from the rock.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then I walked slowly towards the crystal where the barricade was set up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Like ants scattering, people backed away from the direction I was heading.
 </p>

 </p>
 <p>
  I cleared the chat window once more.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though I had pushed it to the corner, dozens of lines of chat appeared simultaneously, blocking my view.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Everyone, prepare for battle!”
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the vigilante members hastily drew his sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  He pointed his trembling right hand with the sword at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t be scared! It’s just one enemy! Don’t let the ruins be taken!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But, Sijar-nim is…”

  “He’ll be alright!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Come to think of it, I don’t see that woman.
 </p>
 <p>
  She was in the center of the blast zone, so she probably turned to powder and disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  The others who had picked a fight with me probably met a similar fate.
 </p>
 <p>
  They should have listened to Jenna.
 </p>
 <p>
  The heroes of the ruins who had gathered to attack me were annihilated all at once.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were the leaders of the Ruin occupation force and elite heroes from each master.
 </p>
 <p>
  A significant gap had formed in the battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Wow.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The Lucette ship hovered above me.
 </p>

 <p>
  The other airships had disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;That’s amazing.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not really.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It was clear that I was a 4-star.
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to high-level heroes, my stats were average, but the level of my skills and engraving, and my proficiency, were on a different level. The best I could achieve with the engraving in this section was to make my body became slightly faster, tougher, and stronger.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, it was not enough to overturn a battlefield alone.
 </p>
 <p>
  This skill had great destructive power, but the movement was big, making it easy to predict the landing point.
 </p>
 <p>
  Furthermore, once used, Ascend and Black Dragon Scale could not be used for a while, so it was hard to call it a perfect skill.
 </p>
 <p>
  If they had moved out of the way as soon as I jumped, the damage would have been much less.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is the difference in experience. The heroes here probably had little experience fighting enemies with superhuman strength.
 </p>

 <p>
  ‘…It’s funny.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s like fighting a monster, indeed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Large movements and predictable landing points?
 </p>
 <p>
  Easier said than done. A 80-ton object falling at supersonic speed.
 </p>
 <p>
  I clicked my tongue.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a single show of force, the battle had come to a halt.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked around the outskirts of the ruins. Most of the ones who had landed to take the ruins were fleeing. With the death of the leader-level heroes, they probably thought continuing to fight would result in greater losses.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed they thought I could use that technique several times.
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned my eyes to the Silver Star’s barricade.
 </p>
 <p>
  The vigilante members with drawn weapons were facing off against me. But they had no intention of charging at me. They watched me with frightened eyes from a distance.

 <p>
  One familiar young man stepped forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even with such power… you had…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Adilang Rizos, the leader of the Silver Star heroes.
 </p>
 <p>
  His neat outfit was dirty with dust and blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  His lips were blue as if his magic had backfired.
 </p>
 <p>
  Adilang looked at me with vacant eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “From the beginning, were you playing with us?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you talking about.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We just…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Enough of your nonsense. I’m sick of hearing it.”

 <p>
  I scoffed.
 </p>
 <p>
  This guy was no fool.
 </p>
 <p>
  He must have known that the vigilante group was going to stab the Silver Star in the back.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re finished, aren’t we?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seems so.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I answered emotionlessly.
 </p>
 <p>
  All the Silver Star heroes in the fortress were dead.
 </p>
 <p>
  There weren’t many left near the barricade, and the elite heroes had been annihilated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if we retreated now, others would soon come to take the ruins.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Innocent people were killed too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The entire ruins had become a battlefield.
 </p>
 <p>
  Most of the non-combatants of the Silver Star here would have died.
 </p>
 <p>
  PVP users indiscriminately bombarded airships carrying refugees.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  I had other options.
 </p>
 <p>
  I could have helped the Silver Star to drive out the vigilante group and received the resources I needed.
 </p>
 <p>
  There would have been no need for such bloodshed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Adilang showed no will to fight.
 </p>
 <p>
  By now, he must have heard that Jenna and Velkist had approached the goddess statue.

 <p>
  But he said nothing, only showing a bitter smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you don’t want to fight, then stay in the waiting room and never come out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Live self-sufficiently with the kids in the waiting room. Don’t instill weird ideas in others. It will never go the way you want.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Silver Star guild was already in ruins.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even without me, it would have soon disbanded.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had just accelerated the timing.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is this rationalization?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, it doesn’t matter.
 </p>
 <p>
  I leaned against the rock behind me.

 </p>
 <p>
  Flash.
 </p>
 <p>
  The crystal beyond the barricade turned blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a notification of a successful occupation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Han.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked back at Adilang.
 </p>
 <p>
  His body was faintly shimmering.
 </p>
 <p>
  Reverse summoning. He was returning to the waiting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We will not forget today’s events.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do as you wish.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Adilang disappeared into the light.
 </p>
 <p>
  The other heroes who had been pointing their swords at me awkwardly disappeared one by one.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eventually, no one was left here but me.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Congratulations, Master, on your successful occupation of the ruin!]

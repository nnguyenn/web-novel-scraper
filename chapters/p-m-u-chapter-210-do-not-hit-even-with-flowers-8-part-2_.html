  [Congratulations, Master, on your successful occupation of the ruin!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tips/ A ‘Ruins’ tab has been created in the menu. In the Ruins tab, you can check the resource status and the date of the next occupation battle. Strengthen your defenses and replenish your troops. We wish you victory in the next battle as well!]

 <p>
  A victory message appeared on Anytng’s screen with fanfare.
 </p>
 <p>
  I grabbed my throbbing head and walked toward the barricade.
 </p>
 <p>
  The aftereffects of Ascend and Black Dragon Scale, and the aftermath of the contamination.
 </p>
 <p>
  My body was in shambles.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Hmph, saying they won’t forget. I’ve heard that thousands of times.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Don’t mind it. Heroes carry thousands of grudges and hatreds on their backs as they move forward.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  This guy is spouting nonsense again.
 </p>
 <p>
  If I cared, I wouldn’t have done this.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was tired of the talk about heroes and whatnot.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anyway, the ruin ended with Townia’s victory.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng moved to the next stage immediately.
 </p>
 <p>
  After setting up a dimensional gate connecting the waiting room and the ruin, he summoned the workers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then he ordered the collection of rare woods and ores scattered throughout the ruins.
 </p>
 <p>
  These resources would be used to make equipment and airships.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’ll be just take and leave this time.’
 </p>
 <p>
  There was about a week left until the next occupation battle in reality.
 </p>
 <p>
  If we gathered resources by then, it would be enough to increase our strength.

 <p>
  The enemies would probably form alliances and attack in the next round.
 </p>
 <p>
  Attacking with a few and defending with a few were completely different matters.
 </p>
 <p>
  It would be better to take and leave.
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t afford to deplete the waiting room’s strength here.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Black Dragon Strike!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Townia’s 4th floor office.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle, wearing a black dragon mask, was flapping her wings.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle spun around and fell quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hahahaha!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Laughing heartily, Iselle took off her mask.

  [Above Heaven and Earth! I Alone Am Supreme! Invincible! I am the unparalleled Loki! This is the prelude to the legend… Gah!]
 </p>
 <p>
  I grabbed Iselle’s cheek and stretched it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her soft cheeks stretched like clay.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Why, why? I stayed up all night preparing to show you!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s with the Black Dragon Strike?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s Loki’s skill name. How is it, isn’t it super cool?]
 </p>
 <p>
  I grabbed one of Iselle’s wings and spun her around.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle’s body spun like a windmill.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Gyaaaah!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stop it.”

  While spinning Iselle with my left hand, I moved the hologram cursor with my right hand.

 <p>
  The official Pick Me Up cafe screen appeared on the window before me.

 <p>
  [I’m writing this to inform many PeacfulCity users, pacifist users, and friendly users who enjoy Pick Me Up about an incident that occurred in our guild.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, there was.
 </p>
 <p>
  I increased Iselle’s spinning speed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Gyaaaa!]

  Seachorom, Adilang’s master, had posted on the incident board.
 </p>
 <p>
  The post, with several attached screenshots, detailed the circumstances of Anytng joining the guild and the start of the occupation battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, it cleanly omitted what Anytng had heard from the vigilante group members and what had happened during the resource distribution process.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Comments 548&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Hundreds of comments were attached.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed to have drawn quite a bit of attention.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a good post for community users, always hungry for stimulation, to grab popcorn over.

  The comment section was a mess.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were occasional users defending Anytng, but they were soon buried under the barrage of criticism.

  [Waaaaaaaah!]
 </p>
 <p>
  I increased Iselle’s spinning speed even more.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to Iselle, Anytng had seen this post too.
 </p>
 <p>
  But he hadn’t posted a rebuttal.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yes. That’s better.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ve gone through similar situations.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once a public opinion campaign starts in a community, rebuttals rarely work.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here and there, IDs belonging to the Silver Star guild were noticeable in the comments.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were pushing with numbers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if Anytng posted what kind of messages he had received, they would spin it and paint him as bad-mannered.
 </p>
 <p>
  A witch hunt doesn’t end until the target is completely vilified.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was how pacifists took revenge on carnivores.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s okay.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng, who had logged into the game, was staring blankly at the main screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Don’t mind them.’
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter what they babble, do as you wish.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s why I’m here for.

 <p>
  “I’m Jenna Shirai! From Townia… huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna furrowed her brows.
 </p>

 <p>
  Her dark eyes blinked endlessly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You look… bizarre.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna smiled awkwardly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first-born 5-star hero summoned in Townia, Wiryung, looked at me sitting on the bench.
 </p>
 <p>
  Black hair and black eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  She was wearing a wide and fluttering martial artist’s robe,
 </p>
 <p>
  And a scabbard with tassels hung at her waist.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Excuse me, where are you from…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jenna.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I interrupted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “She’s not from Townia.”
 </p>
 <p>
  You can tell at a glance.
 </p>
 <p>
  From hair color to facial features, body type to attire, everything was different.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…This place.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The woman opened her mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a voice with no emotion.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This place is called Townia.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Wiryung looked at the floor with hollow eyes.
 </p>

 </p>
 <p>
  [Tips / Heroes in ‘despondency’ cannot be deployed on missions. Console and cheer them up to relieve despondency!]
 </p>
 <p>
  I held my forehead.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course. The head office wouldn’t easily release a 5-star.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seems we’ve been thoroughly played.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jenna, go upstairs first. I’ll talk to her.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shouldn’t I stay?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s okay.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Fine. See you later, sis.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna glanced at Wiryung, who was standing still, then climbed the stairs to the upper floor.

  “How long are you going to stay dazed?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I… couldn’t protect…”
 </p>
 <p>
  She mumbled to herself as if she had gone mad.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What a nuisance.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I grabbed Wiryung’s wrist roughly.
 </p>
 <p>
  If I remember correctly, there was an empty room in the left corner of the first floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I grabbed her wrist and led her, she staggered and followed me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clunk.
 </p>
 <p>
  After entering the room, I locked the door and sat Wiryung on the steel chair in the middle of the room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then I sat on the chair opposite and faced Wiryung.

 </p>

  “Aren’t you going to answer?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It wasn’t a dream…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I grabbed Wiryung’s chin and lifted it towards me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Answer my question. If you don’t want to die.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…You.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You, what.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you the lord of this place?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Lord?”

 <p>
  What kind of word is that?
 </p>
 <p>
  After thinking for a moment, I recalled that ‘lord’ was similar to ‘sub-master.’
 </p>
 <p>
  “Maybe.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Wiryung gave a bitter smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then she fell silent again.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is infuriating.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked ahead with my legs crossed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Wiryung was still lowering her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Unique attire. Strange words. Peculiar accent.’

 <p>
  I could understand her words, but her tone was subtly different.
 </p>
 <p>
  It felt like a foreigner speaking Korean.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘An East Asian out of nowhere, huh?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I scratched my head.
 </p>
 <p>
  The worlds belonging to Mobius were almost Western in style.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each world had knights, warriors, archers, rogues, mages, and elementalists,
 </p>
 <p>
  With medieval castles, monsters, dragons, and magic.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Status window.’

 </p>
 <p>
  I had no choice but to click my tongue.
 </p>
 <p>
  This girl was just level 1.
 </p>
 <p>
  But her strength was 36, health 38, agility 41.
 </p>
 <p>
  At level 1, she was comparable to a level 20 hero. She came out with highly efficient skills like advanced swordsmanship, and had two rare B-grade or higher imprints.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No wonder people risk their wealth for such a draw.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The starting line was different.
 </p>
 <p>
  I tried all sorts of things to get a born 5-star, but never succeeded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, even born 5-stars had their drawbacks.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s hard to trade between users.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was possible to trade.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I was transporting resources from the ruins, I bought a 5-star hero with gems.
 </p>
 <p>
  But I couldn’t use the guy I bought properly.
 </p>
 <p>
  He pined away and died.
 </p>
 <p>
  Born 5-stars could hardly exert their power if their affiliation changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The current training center head of Niflheimr was a very rare case.

 <p>
  So to use a 5-star properly, you had to summon and use it yourself.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Oath of the Sworn, huh.’
 </p>
 <p>
  She came out with an obviously annoying penalty.
 </p>
 <p>
  Abilities of the engravings are halved in ‘other places’?
 </p>
 <p>
  Bet it would apply in Townia too.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at Wiryung again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Going over what I knew about Pick Me Up.
 </p>
 <p>
  I seemed to know where that woman came from.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There’s only one place.’

 </div>
 <p>
  I smiled bitterly.
 </p>
 <p>
  That woman wasn’t from Server 2.
 </p>
 <p>
  In other words, she came from the overseas server of Pick Me Up.
 </p>
 <p>
  No wonder I was confused.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Korean server didn’t have that kind of world setting.
 </p>
 <p>
  It must be Server 3.
 </p>
 <p>
  Server 3 covered the whole of East Asia, including China and Japan.
 </p>
 <p>
  In other words, she came from abroad.
 </p>
 <p>
  In red, (Lotus).
 </p>
 <p>
  The character was embroidered on the left chest of her clothing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Muryeon, huh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Wiryung, who had her head bowed, raised it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How do you know…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, you’re a second-hand good.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if the server was different, it was unmistakable.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was that famous and powerful.
 </p>
 <p>
  Account name: Muryeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  The user at the top of the millions of Pick Me Up accounts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Currently ranked 2nd.
 </p>
 <p>
  The problem was, that a hero from Muryeon was now in front of me as an event prize.
 </p>
 <p>
  This could only mean one thing.
 </p>
 <p>
  I closed my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The second ranker is dead.’

 <p>
  Wiryung nodded and drew her sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  A silver-white longsword as thin as a paper.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  The sword tip trembled, perhaps due to the rebound of drawing it from its scabbard.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ve become pitifully weak.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Wiryung sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Weakened.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If this girl had originally been a core executive of Muryeon and was repackaged during its fall, her level and skills were likely reset.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Wiryung took a deep breath.
 </p>
 <p>
  I picked up an iron sword from the side of the duel area.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though she was a 5-star, it was a battle between level 1 and level 40.
 </p>
 <p>
  I decided to play along moderately, adjusting my level.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s see how it goes.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s similar to the feeling when using Ascend.
 </p>
 <p>
  The difference is that instead of increasing output, I was intentionally lowering it.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a method Ridgion used when sparring with me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thanks for the consideration.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Wiryung, perhaps understanding my state, spoke up.
 </p>
 <p>
  I nodded and loosely gripped the iron sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wiryung of Muryeon, captain of the Heavenly Seamless Squad, Red Sword Wiryung.”

 <p>
  Wiryung, who had tied her black hair, bowed to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her eyes sank.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please take care of me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just fight.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You are a master, so I’ll let you take the first move!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Wiryung’s body vanished in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  Without looking, I swung my sword backward.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang!
 </p>
 <p>
  The sound of metal clashing.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  I took a step back.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was because the tip of the flexible sword had dug into the blade.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Soft sword technique.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A rarely used weapon technique even in ‘Pick Me Up.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If I hadn’t experienced it in a sparring session with Ridigion, I might have bled just now.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why can’t you wield your sword properly?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang! Clang! Clang-clang-clang!
 </p>
 <p>
  I blocked the continuously wriggling soft sword strikes and asked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Oath of the Sworn is a vow to dedicate oneself to justice and righteousness.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Cut the nonsense.”

 <p>
  “In Muryeon, you can’t reach the pinnacle without making a vow.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s a kind of self-imposed penalty.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How can a 4-star reach the state of sword and body becoming one already?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you even trying to make me understand what you’re saying?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Wiryung, changing her stance three times in a row in midair, launched an attack.
 </p>
 <p>
  A triple slash aiming for the chest, waist, and thigh. I swept my sword upward to block the attack and then switched to offense.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What a pity. If you were from Muryeon, you could have achieved great things…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Wiryung was moving freely in the air.
 </p>

 <p>
  As if running through the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Muryeon, huh.’
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s some connection with Niflheimr.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had even interacted with Muryeon’s master during the server unification war that happened every few months.
 </p>
 <p>
  Muryeon’s heroes, except for a few non-combatants, were mostly masters of martial arts. They focused on honing their weapon skills and added Muryeon’s unique engraving, and qi techniques, to further enhance their strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  Estimated heroes: 50,000.
 </p>
 <p>
  In terms of numbers, it’s nearly double that of Niflheimr.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Why did they fall?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I thought while exchanging blows with Wiryung.
 </p>
 <p>
  Muryeon was the undisputed ruler of the Asia server.

 <p>
  Especially the sub-master, Dan Jaheum, was one of the level 400+ 7-star heroes who had mastered 17 types of martial arts.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Did they fail a mission?’
 </p>
 <p>
  No.
 </p>
 <p>
  I shook my head.
 </p>
 <p>
  After reaching the 89th floor of the tower, Muryeon officially declared they would stop climbing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You are strong.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stop acting funny.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If this girl’s abilities hadn’t been reset, I might have lost.
 </p>
 <p>
  The captain of a Muryeon subsidiary.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the past, she would have been a max-level 6-star.
 </p>

 <p>
  ‘Internal strife?’
 </p>
 <p>
  No way.
 </p>
 <p>
  Muryeon’s unity was formidable.
 </p>
 <p>
  They would swarm like bees even if you touched a small merchant ship.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I remembered. I devoted my soul to the priestess to avenge and set her will straight. If necessary, I will gladly face millions of sabre forests.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Wiryung’s sword movements became lighter.
 </p>
 <p>
  I gradually lifted my restrictions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Otherwise, I wouldn’t be able to keep up.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was hard to believe she was level 1.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ding!]

  [The despondency status of ‘Wiryung (★★★★★)’ has been lifted!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You can now dispatch her on missions!]
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the penalty of the engraving remains.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is your request?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There is a place I need to go in the second zone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Tacheonhyang (The Fallen Heaven).”
 </p>
 <p>
  Holly shit.
 </p>
 <p>
  I should ask Katiio to prepare a translation spell or something.
 </p>
 <p>
  I can’t understand what she’s saying.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s called Niflheimr in this place.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I stopped my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Wiryung, who was thrusting her soft sword, also stopped and looked at me as if asking what was wrong.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why do you want to go there?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can’t tell you the reason… But it’s a mission tied to my duty. Please help me just once. I must convey a message to the lord there.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Say it here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Wiryung bit her lip in frustration.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sorry, but it’s a message that the likes of you, the lord of a smaller place, wouldn’t understand.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then I won’t help you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh…”

  “Tell me as much as you can. Why is Niflheimr involved? I’m curious.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this a sect affiliated with Tacheonhyang?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not, but there is some relation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I sheathed my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hearing an unexpected word dampened my enthusiasm.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at Wiryung.
 </p>
 <p>
  Wiryung seemed to be pondering.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, as if understanding, she muttered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s alright. Not many know that profane name.”

 <p>
  Wiryung stiffened her flexible sword and sheathed it in the white scabbard.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve learned a lot.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  It was an ambiguous sparring session where neither of us showed our cards, but Wiryung bowed to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What I say now is an absolute secret. If it leaks, I have no choice but to take responsibility.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sure, sure.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I am a member of Muryeon and came to the second zone under the special order of the lord.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Wiryung took a couple of deep breaths.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then she spoke again.
 </p>
 <p>
  “El Cid, mobilize…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stop.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I waved my hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I haven’t finished speaking yet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You don’t have to. I understand.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;This is interesting.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  An all-too-familiar voice echoed in my head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Have you been listening?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Of course. I always watch over you, Master. Anyway, I didn’t expect to hear that name again. I thought he was dead due to the lack of news.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “He wouldn’t die.”
 </p>
 <p>
  That monstrous guy.

  Yurnet pulled out the chair at the head of the table.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  And she patted the cushion, signaling me to sit.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “….”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, it’s not the first time.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  I sighed and sat down.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait a moment, isn’t that the seat for the lord? How can you….”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mind your words. This person is Loki, the master of Niflheimr and commander of all civil and military officials.”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “What?”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Wiryung’s expression changed rapidly.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>

  From bewilderment to confusion. From confusion to shock.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you… making fun of me?”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course not. This is the ruler of Tachunhyang you’ve been searching for.”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet smiled faintly.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  I clicked my tongue. Did she have to tease her like that?

 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s a special circumstance.”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  From the left corridor of the hall, a young man with a cold impression appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  It was Ridigion, the third ranker.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Given the hasty arrangement, it seemed they could only gather two members from the first party.

 <p>
  Ridgion knelt before me.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master, it’s an honor to see you again.”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t be so formal. It gives me chills.”

 <p>
  Ignoring my words, Ridigion stood up properly.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Switching his gaze between me and Ridgion, Wiryung spoke in frustration.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “The person I’m looking for is the ruler….”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “This person is the ruler of Tachunhyang.”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Wiryung’s mouth dropped open.
 </p>
 <p>

 <p>
  Yurnet whispered in my ear.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master, Ridigion has a special connection with Muryeon.”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “I know that without being told.”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  About three months ago, I had sent Ridgion to Muryeon.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  The purpose, of course, was to elevate Ridigion’s swordsmanship to a higher level.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>

 <p>
  Looking at me with bewildered eyes, Wiryung bit her lip tightly and then,
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “I, Nam Wiryung of Muryeon, have a request to ask from the ruler of Tachunhyang!”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Wiryung knelt before me.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please eliminate that tyrant who broke the peace pact and destroyed our Muryeon!”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Wiryung’s forehead touched the ground with a thud that echoed through the hall.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>

  “….”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  I had anticipated this.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Leaving him alone will bring great disaster not only to Tachunhyang but to the entire world. I beg you, ruler, to subdue him and raise the will of all heavens!”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Subdue, huh.”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet muttered.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  It was an oddly emotionless voice.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you asking us to erase the current number one ranker?”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Indeed. He launched a surprise attack on our Muryeon, killing civilians without any declaration of war. He is utterly ruthless….”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Interesting.”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet stepped forward.
 </p>
 <p>

  Her face had turned cold.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let me handle this.”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridgion stopped Yurnet.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Raise your head, Lord Wi.”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Wiryung lifted her head.

  Her white forehead was now red.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Explain what happened.”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright.”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Wiryung stuttered as she described the events of Muryeon’s downfall.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  While practicing martial arts in the auditorium with her subordinates, a loud noise suddenly erupted, and suspiciously dressed figures stormed in. Their leader killed the martial master Dan Jahm and massacred many Muryeon people.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “….”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridgion closed his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s unfortunate that the master died. He was a remarkable person.”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Indeed. Those people…!”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master.”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridgion turned to me.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  I nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  He spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sorry, but we cannot help Muryeon.”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wh-why not?”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Tachunhyang indeed had a connection with Muryeon. I also learned a lot from there. But we cannot intervene in a situation we do not fully understand. Isn’t that right, Lord Wi?”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “That man…!”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “What you saw were suspicious people storming in, killing the master, and massacring Muryeon people. That’s all.”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridigion continued.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Golden Village is a place even we rarely see. Are you asking us to risk everything to avenge your anger?”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “….”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Calm your mind first.”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Lord Ri, how can you say that! Master respected you so much…!”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nisled.”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  At Yurnet’s brief command, a black figure descended from the ceiling.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Escort her to his room.”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Nisled took the seated Wiryung away.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  The hall became silent.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master.”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m thinking.”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridgion’s words were not wrong.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Wiryung’s testimony did not explain why Muryeon was attacked.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  If Niflheimr was involved, we’d have to take action, but we couldn’t know the situation now.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  One major question remained.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Muryeon and Dorado are from different servers.’
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  They belonged to servers 3 and 4, respectively.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Without a cross-server event, it was impossible to interact with users from other servers.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Mobius is a mess.’
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Until recently, it was known for being bug-free with great servers, but the evaluation changed dramatically.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  The various communities were in an uproar about the chaos.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What is he thinking?’
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  El Cid was not a PvP user.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  He was similar to me, or even more of a hardcore strategy enthusiast than I was.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Did Muryeon provoke him first?
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  That seemed unlikely. Muryeon also refrained from PvP.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Of all times, something like this happening now.’
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Normally, I would leave it to Yurnet, but not this time.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  At least, I needed to understand what happened. Depending on the situation, El Cid might interfere with Niflheimr.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yurnet.”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, I will investigate.”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet bowed to me and disappeared behind the hall.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Only Ridgion and I remained.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “….”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridgion seemed deep in thought.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  He might be reconsidering Wiryung’s testimony or thinking about Dan Jahm, whom he had a master-disciple relationship with.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  He had changed significantly before and after his dispatch. He was already strong, but I felt Ridigion truly became a hero after returning from Muryeon.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He earned the title of Sword Demon from Muryeon, too.’
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps, our stay in Niflheimr would be more than a day or two.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  I quietly left the hall, leaving Ridgion alone.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>

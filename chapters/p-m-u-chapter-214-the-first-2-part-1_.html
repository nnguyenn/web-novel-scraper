  Although I said I would stay in Niflheimr until the investigation results came out, I couldn’t delay for long.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even now, the eggs of the fragments must be stirring in Townia. The maximum time I could stay in Niflheimr was three to four days. After that, I had to return immediately.

 <p>
  “It’s a mess in both places.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I sighed and continued to look through the documents on the desk.
 </p>
 <p>
  These were documents on power expansion brought from Townia.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since I had to start finishing the work as soon as I returned, there was no time to rest.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The target troop count is 400, with five medium to small airships. The heroes must be at least level 40, and the leader-level heroes must have suitable skills and engravings.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When I was the master of Niflheimr, I could delegate work to suitable people, but now it wasn’t easy.
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t pull the already busy Nerissa away for other things. There wasn’t anyone among the existing heroes who was suitable for administrative positions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please have some.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A steaming teacup was placed on the desk.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I turned around, Yurnet was standing there, having arrived unnoticed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The first results will come out by this evening at the latest. There’s no need to rush. We understand well that this is an important time for Townia.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I drank the hot tea and spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re not telling me to stay put like before.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I would like to, but I’ve realized that the master has an attachment to that place.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Attachment?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I clicked my tongue.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was more of a stubbornness than attachment.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a matter of whether I die or they die.

 <p>
  “Isn’t that a kind of attachment too?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet smiled faintly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “At first, I was uneasy about letting the master go alone, but now I’ve decided to just watch quietly. I’ve realized that it has meaning too. If the master had come straight to Niflheimr, it might have taken you a long time to adapt.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t it a bit of a stretch to call it meaningful? You know as well as I do that it’s a place where all sorts of people make a mess.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The gates of Niflheimr are always open, master. Please stay if you wish.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I kept my mouth shut.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was me who said I would stay in Townia.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No matter what crisis comes, I believe you will overcome it. We are just watching from afar.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s quite reassuring.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I gulped down the tea and continued to organize the documents.

 <p>
  Once this was done, the verification work that kept me up all night would almost be finished.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master, what do you plan to do with Wiryung?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have to take her to Townia. The master is watching.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t stay away for long under the excuse of the weekly dungeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  Besides, I found a way to use her. Someone had to do that job, and it was a role that was urgently needed in Townia.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood. I’ll prepare the airship for tomorrow morning.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I see that you want to get rid of me quickly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not that I want to get rid of you, master. I just want to see you finish your job there as soon as possible.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang.
 </p>
 <p>
  A black sheath was placed on the desk.
 </p>

 <p>
  It was made of a special metal, black iron, not wood.
 </p>
 <p>
  A long sword hilt peeked out from the sheath.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The repair of Bifrost is complete. It has been adjusted to fit the engraving you have, so it should be much easier to handle than before.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I hung Bifrost on my belt.
 </p>
 <p>
  It felt slightly heavier than before, but its unique weight was still there.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thanks, I’ll use it well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Knowing her personality, she must have added all sorts of functions to Bifrost.
 </p>
 <p>
  I decided to do a test run once I returned to Townia, in actual combat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sorry for showing such disgrace, lord.”

 <p>
  That evening, Wiryung came to me and apologized.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was overwhelmed with excitement and showed an unsightly appearance. I ask for your generous understanding.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You were speaking informally just a moment ago, and now you’re using honorifics. Just speak like before.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But you are the master of Toetianhyang…”
 </p>
 <p>
  When I glared, Wiryung flinched.
 </p>
 <p>
  I opened my mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If, as you said, Dorado attacked Muryeon without any reason, we won’t just sit back. We don’t know when we’ll get stabbed in the back too. We’re investigating now, so don’t make a fuss about revenge or righteousness, and stay quiet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Wiryung nodded awkwardly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fortunately, she seemed to have regained her reason. If she had continued to spout nonsense, she would have been disposed of by Anytng as soon as we returned to Townia. She barely escaped synthesis.
 </p>
 <p>
  I informed Wiryung of her role in Townia.
 </p>

 <p>
  Due to the Oath of the Sworn, she couldn’t exert her full power in the mission field. However according to Ridigyon, she won’t receive any penalties outside of missions, so there was only one role for her.
 </p>
 <p>
  “She will be in charge of external affairs.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Because of the recent gossip from the Silver Star Guild, public opinion about Anytng was not good.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sometimes, trash would attack. If such trash attacked while we were on a mission on the 50th floor, Townia could suffer devastating damage with only a small number of people left.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Someone has to stay.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If we properly raise Wiryung’s level, who was originally a six-star max level, she could handle dozens of heroes alone. I proposed this role to Wiryung.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is it a temporary job?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s best if you join the mission, but for now, do that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Wiryung immediately answered.
 </p>

  It was a waste to use a five-star hero for external affairs, but it was much better than discarding her through synthesis.
 </p>
 <p>
  That early morning,
 </p>
 <p>
  I stood alone in the annex on the 13th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet called me here, saying a special procedure was needed to receive the investigation report.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master, thank you for waiting. The investigation results are ready.”
 </p>

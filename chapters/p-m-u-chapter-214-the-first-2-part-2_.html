 <p>
  That early morning,
 </p>
 <p>
  I stood alone in the annex on the 13th floor.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  Yurnet called me here, saying a special procedure was needed to receive the investigation report.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master, thank you for waiting. The investigation results are ready.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet appeared from the other side of the annex.
 </p>
 <p>
  Wearing the white robe she wore when we first met.
 </p>
 <p>
  In her right hand was Naglfar, the Book of Illusions, open.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s more accurate to say it’s a reconstruction rather than an investigation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Reconstruction?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sssss.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mist began to pour out from Yurnet’s robe and filled the annex from floor to ceiling, covering every corner.
 </p>
 <p>
  The mist transformed into a different landscape.
 </p>
 <p>
  Numerous pavilions and buildings with pointed roofs. The roofs were covered with tiles, and underneath the buildings were ponds filled with countless blooming lotuses.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I decided not to be surprised anymore.
 </p>
 <p>
  They had this level of ability.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This video is reconstructed from Wiryung’s memories, the residual magic left at the scene, and the information from the informant we dispatched during the previous server merger. The accuracy is about 90%. The error value is less than 5%.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Human-shaped mist began to form all over the buildings.
 </p>
 <p>
  The mist then transformed into the appearance of Muryeon’s heroes, dressed in martial arts uniforms and armed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzzzzt.
 </p>

 <p>
  A static sound spread throughout the space, and they soon became corpses lying on the floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t just dozens.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hundreds. The blood flowing from their corpses fell from the buildings to the pond below.
 </p>
 <p>
  Like a waterfall.
 </p>
 <p>
  And, in the red pavilion in the middle of the pond.
 </p>
 <p>
  Two people stood.
 </p>
 <p>
  One was an ordinary-looking middle-aged man.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was wearing a plain, wide martial arts uniform. A broken sword lay at his feet, and red blood was dripping from his lower right abdomen.
 </p>
 <p>
  The other was a young man with ash-gray hair.
 </p>
 <p>
  The young man, wearing a wolf fur coat, was looking down at the half-collapsed middle-aged man.

 <p>
  “These are Dan Jaheum and Laskanda, the sub-masters of Muryeon and Dorado, respectively.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s over.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Due to the aftermath of the magic clash, we couldn’t reconstruct the battle process, but it seems it was one-sided.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I slowly walked toward the two heroes, looking at the corpses scattered everywhere.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are they all six-star max levels?”
 </p>
 <p>
  They must be the elite of Muryeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  They wouldn’t falter anywhere in the Pick Me Up world.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were massacred by that one person.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It wasn’t a total war.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t an ambush with a large army.
 </p>

 <p>
  The invader was alone. Muryeon was destroyed by a single hero.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet squinted her eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There were a few more companions, but the only one who participated in the actual battle was him.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked closely at the young man.
 </p>
 <p>
  Laskanda. The sub-master of El Cid.
 </p>
 <p>
  The man with the fluttering dark gray hair was called the strongest a year ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  But after a year of absence, that position was taken by Siris.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They said he became a seven-star…”
 </p>
 <p>
  If what I knew was correct, that hero absorbed the master of Dorado.

 <p>
  “Master, Master… Ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked to the side.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the path leading to the pavilion, a familiar woman was lying down.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was Wiryung.
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed.
 </p>
 <p>
  She must have seen it here.
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzzt.
 </p>
 <p>
  A loud static sound filled the space.
 </p>
 <p>
  And Dan Jahem’s mouth opened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why?”
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-6" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Laskanda remained silent.
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t see his face from where I was.
 </p>
 <p>
  I wanted to get closer, but a transparent wall blocked the way.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed to be the limit of the reconstruction magic.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master, we found out something during the reconstruction.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That hero is a bit different from the other seven stars. According to my investigation, the other seven stars have unstable magic patterns because they can’t suppress the surge of interference power, but he was completely stable, it reminds me of… It’s just like the current situation of the master.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Twisting her words again.
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-7" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  I laughed lightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had a feeling of what Yurnet’s words implied.
 </p>
 <p>
  “He’s like me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  No need to think too hard.
 </p>
 <p>
  The condition for advancing to a seven-star is the fusion of the hero and the master. However, considering the war events against the Union Guild, it seems difficult for a hero to handle the master’s power.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That guy is using it properly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t certain yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  But I had a strong feeling.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It wasn’t the hero who consumed the master…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Could it be the other way around?
 </p>

 <p>
  “Our Muryeon has done nothing to harm you. Why do such heinous acts…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dan Jahem half-knelt.
 </p>
 <p>
  His face was already pale, and blood was flowing from his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Joyful.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A slightly low tone.
 </p>
 <p>
  But a clear voice like a song.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It was a very joyful adventure.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you mean…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Everything was joyful since I came here. I had fulfilling experiences. I might have been the luckiest person in the universe.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Laskanda slowly opened his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But that’s all over now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Slicing.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was a sound of someone’s throat being slit, and mist swirled throughout the space.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The video ends here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good job.”
 </p>
 <p>
  An adventure, he said.
 </p>
 <p>
  That guy seemed to have a loose screw somewhere too.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master, this is the last report.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s more?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. In a way, you could say this is the core of the report.”

  Yurnet waved her hand, and a hologram screen appeared in front of me.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the main menu of Pick Me Up. Yurnet manipulated the menu in front of me and entered the help tab. When checking the account information, the account name “Loki” and its unique number, gameplay time, and achievements were listed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Didn’t Laskanda mention an adventure?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He did.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet clicked on the trophy-shaped icon in the corner of the account panel.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the achievement window.

  A feature that was practically ornamental in Pick Me Up, where no clear user had emerged.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What he meant by his adventure being over…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet scrolled down the screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems to be correct.”

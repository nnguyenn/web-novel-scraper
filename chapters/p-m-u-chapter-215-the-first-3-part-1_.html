  Ranking #1, El Cid.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first Master and the first ranker of Pick Me Up.

 <p>
  And just now, he became the first user to clear the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  After calculating the timing, it appeared that El Cid invaded Muryeon after clearing the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  What came next was crucial. To prepare defenses in advance, I needed to know the reason for his attack on Muryeon. As a Master who was not yet complete, with Seris absent, Niflheimr would have to brace for significant losses if he attacked. We could even be defeated.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Why?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The report from Yurnet contained only a recreation video of Muryeon’s destruction and the induction of the first ranker into the Hall of Fame. Other information was still pending, and they were investigating as best as they could.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, Yurnet mentioned that obtaining any more meaningful information would be difficult. Given the immense distance between servers, even the successful recreation of the video was considered a miracle.
 </p>
 <p>
  Should I take action proactively?
 </p>
 <p>
  Or should I wait and observe?
 </p>
 <p>
  There wasn’t much time to ponder.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was about to face the 50th floor, a core section of Townia.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You seem to be deeply troubled.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In the special room installed in Niflheimr’s 13th-floor castle, Yurnet handed me a cup of tea. The finest teacup made of pure white porcelain.
 </p>
 <p>
  As I took a sip, a sharp fragrance wafted to my nose.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry too much. Aren’t you about to face an important battle? The mission there must not be hindered by matters of Niflheimr.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yet you told me not to go before.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If it’s what the Master desires, I’m here to pave the way for you. Of course, it’s not like I have no desires myself. For instance… you’ve been distancing yourself from me lately, but it’s such a trivial thing. Now that I think about it, when was the last time I received a personal message from the master? I don’t remember.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet smiled faintly.
 </p>
 <p>
  I silently drank the tea.
 </p>

  “Anyway, even if we clash with them, it won’t be anytime soon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s still frustrating.”
 </p>
 <p>
  No theories fit the situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first theory was that El Cid, after clearing the tower, shifted his playstyle to PvP since he had no more goals. But that didn’t make sense.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although I didn’t know him well, we had talked a few times, and I had even received tips about the game from him.
 </p>
 <p>
  More importantly…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Why didn’t he return?’
 </p>
 <p>
  If he, like me, had become a hero and fallen into Mobius, he could have returned to reality after clearing the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  He could have left this chaotic world. If it were me, I would have headed straight back to Earth without looking back.
 </p>
 <p>
  But El Cid didn’t leave.
 </p>

  “Master.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We are gathering personal information on the current rank 1. You should have it by the time you clear the 50th floor.”
 </p>
 <p>
  So, we still don’t know why.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I don’t understand.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I recalled the conversation I had with Tel during the 2-star promotion ceremony.
 </p>
 <p>
  The purpose of Pick Me Up.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘To restore a destroyed world.’
 </p>
 <p>
  For that, the power of Earth, a higher dimension, was necessary.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hence, this place was designed like a mobile game to attract Earthlings.

  ‘If El Cid climbed the tower to the end…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Did the world of Dorado revert to its original state, free from the tower’s format?
 </p>
 <p>
  What is happening there now?
 </p>
 <p>
  That, too, is unknown.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…This is annoying.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I scratched my head.
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t want to dwell on questions with no answers.
 </p>
 <p>
  But it was too important to ignore.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed that he voluntarily gave up returning to Earth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps Tel betrayed him too…

  ‘I really don’t understand.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I scratched my head harder.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ll lose your hair like that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It won’t happen, so mind your own business.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I responded irritably and stood up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet was right. Even if we were to fight El Cid, it would be after clearing the 50th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s a sequence to everything. Dwelling on questions without answers yields nothing.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should visit Wiryung.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Wiryung had agreed to guard the waiting room while we were on our mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was as crucial a role as excelling in the mission itself. Nothing would be more demoralizing than returning to a ruined waiting room.
 </p>

 <p>
  I needed to check her condition and reaffirm her resolve.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry. I can do it. I won’t just sit around wasting food.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Wiryung answered with a smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though the shadow on her face had not completely lifted, she seemed much better than when she first arrived.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just one request. If the day comes when we fight him…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Wiryung looked down.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, it’s too shameful for someone who hasn’t achieved anything to ask such a favor of you. I’ll tell you when the day comes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If the day came for a fierce battle with him, I could listen to her then.
 </p>
 <p>
  Until then, she would act as a hero of Townia, not Muryeon.

  “I’ll find a way to use the Oath of the Sworn. It’s not the time to uphold pride.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I like that thought. The sooner, the better.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But why do you endure such hardships? The master of a great sect guarding a trivial border. Is it a form of training?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…You could say that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Explaining everything would be tedious.
 </p>
 <p>
  I gave her a vague answer.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Lord, can I ask one more question?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If it’s something I can answer.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you know what the First District is?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I narrowed my eyes.
 </p>

 <p>
  I couldn’t understand the intention behind the question.
 </p>
 <p>
  Why suddenly ask about the First Server?
 </p>
 <p>
  “I heard Laskanda mention the First District.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He did?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I asked again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps my gaze was intimidating, as Wiryung hurriedly responded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, it was very brief. I might have misheard.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The First Server is a test server. No one can go there.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The First Server was the place used during Pick Me Up’s beta test, where the main system overseeing all areas of the game was located. It was closed when the game officially launched.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, Laskanda mentioned the First Server.
 </p>
 <p>
  I hadn’t heard this information when the scene from Muryeon was recreated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, a premonition struck my mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  But I shook off that thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  I would ponder about him later.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, the 50th floor came first.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sorry for the unnecessary words. It was probably a mistake.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Wiryung bowed her head to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, that can wait for now.
 </p>
 <p>
  Next, I explained the schedule to Wiryung.
 </p>

  We would take an express airship back to Townia at dawn tomorrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once back in Townia, we would begin the final preparations for conquering the 50th floor.

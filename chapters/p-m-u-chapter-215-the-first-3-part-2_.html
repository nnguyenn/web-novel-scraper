 <p>
  Next, I explained the schedule to Wiryung.
 </p>
 <p>
  We would take an express airship back to Townia at dawn tomorrow.

 <p>
  Once back in Townia, we would begin the final preparations for conquering the 50th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Resource issues are resolved.’
 </p>
 <p>
  We had gathered the required number of troops and airships.
 </p>
 <p>
  But another challenge remained.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The level of our heroes.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Townia’s main attack force far exceeded the average 4-star hero level.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was evident from how they dominated large-scale events in 4-star dimensional cities.
 </p>
 <p>
  But it wasn’t enough.
 </p>
 <p>
  I anticipated a horde of named monsters on the 50th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Stronger than regular monsters by several magnitudes. To fight them properly, we needed to enhance our strength further.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If not me, then at least someone similar to me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Since Wiryung, bound by the oath, couldn’t be used in the mission,
 </p>
 <p>
  I had to choose and train one of the existing promising candidates.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Jenna or Velkist, one of the two.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Coincidentally, Goo goo Con mentioned wanting to increase his power.
 </p>
 <p>
  I should ask him immediately upon return.
 </p>
 <p>
  After parting with Wiryung, I prepared for the return to Townia.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, there wasn’t much to prepare. Just securing Bifrost’s sheath to my belt and taking the plan I wrote last night.

  It was time to go back.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whirrr.
 </p>
 <p>
  The makeshift dock on Niflheimr’s 13th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  A small high-speed airship was taking off.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I pray for your victory.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridgion bowed to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I silently nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was always a tacit greeting.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I will not forget your grudge, Lord Wir.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridgon clasped his fists towards Wiryung beside me.

 <p>
  “Thank you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Wiryung returned the gesture, then stepped ahead and climbed the stairs.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet, elegantly dressed in Niflheimr’s conquest attire, approached me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master, I believe you will win as always.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “As always?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aren’t you undefeated? No matter the enemy. Just like when you saved us from hell, save them this time too. And… please return safely.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet placed her hand on her chest.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Remember, if it gets tough, you can always come back. We’ll keep the throne of Niflheimr empty for you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That won’t…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I closed my mouth.

 <p>
  I might stop by briefly like this time, but if there ever came a day when I fully returned, it would be after clearing the 100th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  But it wouldn’t be fun to mention that here. I smirked and continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Count on it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I will.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet bowed to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t be too serious. I’ll stay in touch more often this time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you do that, I won’t ask for anything more.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet smiled playfully and slowly stepped back.
 </p>
 <p>
  I nodded to the two of them and boarded the airship.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Departing!&gt;

  “…”

  A holographic screen was floating.

  On the screen, awkwardly made paper dolls were clapping.

  Finally, after about 20 minutes, the long video ended, and the credits closed.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a sound effect, a message appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, the scenario ‘Dorado’ has concluded.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [But don’t forget.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The real adventure begins now!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Bzzz.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gray noise flashed across the entire screen, and the holographic window vanished.
 </p>
 <p>
  The man stood alone in the vast plaza.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon, darkness surrounded him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…This world.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He murmured.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is empty.”

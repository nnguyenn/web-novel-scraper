 <p>
  Muryeon and I returned to Townia.
 </p>
 <p>
  Due to Iselle’s manipulation of the log, it would have seemed to Anytng that we had been at the Weekly Dungeon.

 <p>
  Given that we were away for more than a day or two, there was enough room for suspicion, but without evidence, nothing happened. Anytng continued operations as usual.
 </p>
 <p>
  With resource extraction from the ruins, there were no longer issues in terms of quantity.
 </p>
 <p>
  If desired, we could recruit hundreds of lower-tier heroes. The third airship, Tia, was completed in the hangar, and now the fourth and fifth airships were under construction.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, as our power increased, Anytng dispatched Party 1 to the 46th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  The mission was to bring Pria, trapped on the floating island, back to the ground. It was as expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  I hijacked the Church army’s airship that was wandering the outskirts of the floating island and successfully rescued Pria to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  Up to this point, it was as smooth as other sub-stages.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some enemies appeared, but they were negligible, and we overcame them without significant difficulty.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the 50th floor would be different.
 </p>
 <p>
  It would probably be the largest mission since I started conquering Townia.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to Goo Goo Con, it was highly likely that named monsters like the Beast King and the Saintess, whom I encountered on the 45th floor, would appear simultaneously.
 </p>
 <p>
  Such monsters cannot be dealt with by sheer numbers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sending a bunch of underlings would only result in a massacre.
 </p>
 <p>
  We needed to confront them with elite heroes and end it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Elite heroes, huh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The heroes who could be considered elite in Townia were the members of Party 1 and Party 2.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were ten in total, and they had significantly higher growth rates than other heroes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among them, Party 1 stood out.

 <p>
  With top-tier 4-star Kishasha, the mage Katiio, the exceptionally talented Jenna, the fiercely competitive Velkist, and finally, myself. Even if transferred to a comparable high-level account, they were heroes worthy of being in the top tier.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The problem is…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The difficulty level of Townia is not ordinary.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition to being fundamentally difficult, a prince who can manipulate interference power is causing trouble.
 </p>
 <p>
  I have gotten stronger by obtaining the Black Dragon Blood, but it still feels lacking with just me alone.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, given enough time, the party members could catch up to me, but we didn’t have much leisure.
 </p>
 <p>
  We had to rapidly increase our strength in a short time.
 </p>
 <p>
  The easiest way to strengthen heroes quickly is to raise the level of their engravings.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re suggesting summoning another ancient species.”

 <p>
  In my private room on the 4th floor of the training center.
 </p>
 <p>
  Goo Goo Con was diligently pecking at the feed bowl.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha had set up a feed bowl and water bottle here because a pigeon was roaming around.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you could fully handle my power, it wouldn’t matter, but you’re still far from it. Tsk tsk, such lazy boy. With such potential, you can only use the third stage. If I had your body, by now… Ahem!”
 </p>
 <p>
  When I grabbed his neck, Goo Goo Con cleared his throat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anyway, look at this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Goo Goo Con held out something he was holding with his wings.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a small scale with a pale gray tint, an old, worn-out keratin.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was an item picked up by a hero who went on an exploration dungeon mission, called ‘Unidentified Shedding.’ With just the description, it was unclear what it was for, and Anytng had planned to discard it but left it as a junk item.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is the scale of that annoying guy,”
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 </div>
 <p>
  “Annoying guy?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The White Dragon Assinis.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Assinis was one of the four founding members of the Townia.
 </p>
 <p>
  A monster on par with the Black Dragon.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you use this as a catalyst, it seems possible to summon him through the summoning ritual.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Summoning an S-class summoning monster with just one scale?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I clicked my tongue.
 </p>
 <p>
  The reason I was able to summon this guy was because of the power of a top-tier summoning stone.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, there was no leftover. The one I won as a prize in the battle royale was all I had.
 </p>
 <p>
  Top-tier summoning stones don’t even come out of ruins.

  “I don’t have any summoning stones that can be used right now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No need for such troublesome items. Just let me enter the dungeon, and I’ll summon him.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Peck peck peck.
 </p>
 <p>
  Goo Goo Con spoke while still diligently pecking at the feed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Have you opened the second engraving?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I narrowed my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had an idea of what Goo Goo Con was talking about.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a 4-star, I could only hold one engraving.
 </p>
 <p>
  To add another engraving slot, I had to advance to 5-star.
 </p>
 <p>
  In other words, I needed to be 5-star to have two engravings.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-6" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  “Level 55.”
 </p>
 <p>
  That was the requirement to advance to 5-star.
 </p>
 <p>
  After clearing the 49th floor and using synthesis well, achieving level 55 with the current floor was not difficult.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you saying to use the White Dragon Blood as my second engraving?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you planning to give it to your subordinate?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Efficiency-wise, that’s correct.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If I obtained the White Dragon Blood now, it would be like wielding two weapons with one hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even using just the main engraving wouldn’t add to the combat efficiency, so it was more efficient to pass the White Dragon Blood to others.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you really think an ordinary human can handle that power? Foolishness. Even if they are blessed by the goddess, their vessel cannot contain us. If you try to force it, it will overflow and spill out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Goo Goo Con stopped pecking at the feed and looked at me.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Use it yourself. Our power is only granted to transcendent beings.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The higher the engraving grade, the higher the dungeon’s difficulty, and the higher the failure rate when engraved on a hero.
 </p>
 <p>
  The price of failure is contamination.
 </p>
 <p>
  In other words, it’s the same as the hero dying.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry. Unlike with me, there will be no trial or whatever to survive.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”

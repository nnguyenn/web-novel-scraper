  Preparations for opening the Descent Dungeon were progressing steadily.
 </p>
 <p>
  Obtaining the scale, a summoning catalyst for the ancient species that once ruled Townia, the White Dragon Assinis, was successful, but it was not the end. We had to create a dedicated summoning inscription stone based on it.

 <p>
  Here, I once again borrowed Iselle’s power.
 </p>
 <p>
  At first, Iselle opposed knowing that Velkist, not I, would gain the high-level engraving, but eventually, she was persuaded.
 </p>
 <p>
  [★!Super Success!★]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★★★★)’ has created ‘Advanced Descent Stone (White Dragon’s Soul)!’]
 </p>
 <p>
  I successfully made the summoning stone.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even without the top-grade descent stone, there were spare advanced descent stones obtained from events.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to the pigeon, while the Black Dragon was summoned through the method of secondary summoning, this time it would be different. He said that if he followed, he could summon it directly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is this why connections are important?’
 </p>
 <p>
  And so, during the early morning when everyone was asleep.
 </p>
 <p>
  A rift in the dimension on the first floor of the plaza was open.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked back.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist was sitting on a bench with his legs crossed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you ready?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist stood up from the bench.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clink. The scabbard hanging from his belt shook.
 </p>
 <p>
  Goo Goo Con, who was next to Velkist, jumped down to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Hmph, no matter how many times I think about it, this is a reckless act.&gt;

 <p>
  [Not sure if it will work out well, this is not even for Han.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle fluttered her wings.
 </p>
 <p>
  Without Anytng, we couldn’t open the dimensional rift without borrowing Iselle’s power.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle, still upset, puffed out her red-tinged cheeks.
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s a pity. If it were Han, he would use that power better. That fool with that head of him full of fighting… Wah!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t mind her.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I won’t.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Waaaaah!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Splash!
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle, who spun like a pinwheel, crashed into the fountain.

 <p>
  Entering the Descent Dungeon was again done without Anytng’s knowledge. If Anytng were here, he might have had other ideas. He might use the engraving on me or even on Jenna.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to what I heard from Goo Goo Con, the abilities of the White Dragon Blood were more suitable for a close-combat hero than an archer like Jenna. It’s no wonder the Assinis family uses swords.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmmm…’
 </p>
 <p>
  I thought of Delphine, the heir of Assinis.
 </p>
 <p>
  She died absurdly during a mission despite inheriting the White Dragon Blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  She couldn’t resist at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the 5-star summoning ticket prioritized summoning heroes from the same account, Delphine might have been summoned instead of Wiryung.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;That woman was also quite incompetent. If she had properly used the White Dragon Blood, that magician would be dead.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Goo Goo Con said that Delphine, said to be the empire’s strongest, could not fully utilize the power of the White Dragon Blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before the world transformation into a game, Townia’s military power seems to have lagged behind expectations.

 <p>
  “If you gain the favor of that White Dragon or whatever inside, shouldn’t that be better? Is it okay to just fight it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Foolish. How strong do you think you are? Everything about you is unsatisfactory.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  [It says you’d be useless in a fight, you will be crushed like a bug.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle, who had returned, translated Goo Goo Con’s complaints.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist frowned slightly but didn’t touch Goo Goo Con.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then he muttered with his eyes closed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m here to escape being a bug.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;No matter how much a bug grows, can it become a lion?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  I feel like I’ve heard this kind of dialogue before.

  “I don’t know what’s in there, but I don’t think you’ll fight. The rest is up to you. Do your best.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist jingled the pouch he held in his left hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside was the summoning stone I made.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m off.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist walked into the dimensional rift.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;I really don’t know about this. I take no responsibility. Don’t blame me later.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Goo Goo Con followed Velkist briskly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud.
 </p>
 <p>
  The door to the dimensional rift closed.

 <p>
  Soon, a faint light seeped through the crack in the door.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist and Halkion must be moving to the Descent Dungeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  [But Loki, isn’t a high-level engraving a bit tough for a 4-star hero?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle sat on my shoulder.
 </p>
 <p>
  She wasn’t lamenting that I couldn’t use the White Dragon Blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  She was simply curious.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Normally, yes. It’s tough for a 4-star.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle wasn’t wrong.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if one obtained a high-level engraving above grade A, using it on a low-level hero would likely result in failure.
 </p>
 <p>
  Adapting to high-level engravings required a process.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  Starting with lower-grade engravings, the hero had to grow.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the hero’s grade increased, gradually bestowing higher-level engravings would make it manageable up to the grade A engraving at the 6-star max level.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s a gamble.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I don’t like gambling.
 </p>
 <p>
  Minimizing variables and increasing opportunities to intervene with skill.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s also a basic condition for being a ranker.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But here, I can only gamble.’
 </p>
 <p>
  So far, most have worked, but I might fail someday.
 </p>
 <p>
  I just hope the cost isn’t too high.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m back.”

 <p>
  It was near dawn when I met Velkist again.
 </p>
 <p>
  I examined Velkist.
 </p>
 <p>
  He hadn’t changed outwardly.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was the same as when he went in.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How did it go?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It was nothing much. Just a few trivial questions and answers.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist handed me a leather pouch.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I opened the pouch, a white glowing bead was visible.
 </p>
 <p>
  The abilities of the inscription appeared right after.
 </p>
 <p>
  [True White Dragon Blood (S, Lv.1)]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proof of the pure bloodline of the ancient White Dragon. It contains unprecedented power.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Unique Skill: 1. White Dragon Horn]
 </p>
 <p>
  [※ Other unknown skills exist.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Like the Black Dragon Blood, the inscription window was simple.
 </p>
 <p>
  Only a few lines of description.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘S-grade.’
 </p>
 <p>
  An engraving grade sought after by many masters in Pick Me Up.
 </p>
 <p>
  S-grade engravings were difficult to obtain and had boundless potential.
 </p>
 <p>
  And Townia had already obtained two S-grade engravings with this.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The rewards match the difficulty level.’
 </p>

 <p>
  Knowing this, some hardcore users might deliberately try to increase the difficulty.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Tsk, tsk, a commoner gaining the Wave King’s power. The end of the world is nigh.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Goo Goo Con walked out.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wave King, huh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist murmured.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed he could hear Goo Goo Con’s voice during the descent process.
 </p>
 <p>
  Goo Goo Con continued in a bored tone.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Why do you think the Assinis family could reign as the empire’s strongest for thousands of years? If you can handle that power, you’ll be dozens of times stronger than now.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t care what that is. But… I like that I can become stronger.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;What confidence, without even completing the engraving ritual? It’s bound to fail anyway.&gt;
 </p>

 <p>
  “Can we start right away?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist looked at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I shook my head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We need preparation. You must be tired too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then I’ll go first. Thank you for your help.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After bowing his head to me, Velkist took the pouch with the engraving stone and went up the stairs.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Wave King? What a cool name. It should have been used on Loki.]
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Cool? He’s just full of hot air.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  [So, if you two fight, who would win?]
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Of course, I would… ahem!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s not a clear answer. Will you lose?]
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;You noisy fairy! There’s such a thing as compatibility in the world! And that guy’s skills are broken!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Leaving the two fools behind, I climbed the stairs.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’m curious about Anytng’s reaction.

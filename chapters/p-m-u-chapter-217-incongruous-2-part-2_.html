  The next day.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the evening, Anytng logged in and grasped the situation.
 </p>

 <p>
  Velkist opened the Descent Dungeon and brought back an S-grade engraving stone.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng seemed surprised for a moment but quickly composed himself, as this wasn’t the first time.
 </p>
 <p>
  He immediately checked the help tab for engraving.
 </p>
 <p>
  I suggested that Anytng use the engraving stone on Velkist.
 </p>
 <p>
  [※Warning!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Inscriptions can fail, and failed heroes will enter a corrupted state. Do you really want to attempt the inscription?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes / No (Choose)]
 </p>
 <p>
  But Anytng refused to engrave it.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s natural.
 </p>
 <p>

 <p>
  [Target hero – Velkist (★★★★)]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Success rate – 2%]
 </p>
 <p>
  2%.
 </p>
 <p>
  The cost of failure was hero corruption.
 </p>
 <p>
  No sane person would attempt such a gamble.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…It’s different from me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist’s success rate was clear.

  [Engraving can fail, and failed heroes will enter a corrupted state.]
 </p>
 <p>
  This was the log that popped up when Anytng tried to use the engraving stone on me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite having the same hero grade, the success rates were vastly different.
 </p>
 <p>
  If things continued, the White Dragon Blood would likely be engraved on me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng would engrave the White Dragon Blood on me as soon as a second engraving slot opened.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There’s only one way.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng would surely be angry at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because I acted against his will.
 </p>
 <p>
  Objectively, Anytng’s judgment was right.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The success rate is 2%.”

 <p>
  Early morning, in the private room of the training center.
 </p>
 <p>
  I told Velkist.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Fifty attempts for one success. I’m really weak.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist smiled bitterly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not about strength or weakness. You’re not ready yet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then what about you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “My case is different.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s not a matter of talent.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s more about the circumstances, I guess.
 </p>
 <p>
  Maybe such things are also considered talent.

 </p>
 <p>
  “I know. Training is required.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The pigeon’s words about dying… are not a joke.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I had faced corruption several times while learning Black Dragon Blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  This power is strong.
 </p>
 <p>
  But dangerous.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I know that too. As I requested, if it seems I won’t make it, please end me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist handed me his scabbard.
 </p>
 <p>
  He entrusted his weapon to me. His request to kill him was sincere.
 </p>
 <p>
  I accepted the scabbard.

  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aaron also broke through that wall. I don’t want to be miserable anymore. If I can’t get stronger through effort and talent, what else do I have? Only my life.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist gritted his teeth.
 </p>
 <p>
  As if recalling something.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I apologize. I must look really pathetic now. I have no excuse even if my head is cut off. But… I can’t bear it anymore.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why do you want to be strong?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Because this is all I have.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist said emotionlessly.

 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist had no family name.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having no family name was a mark of being below a slave in Townia.
 </p>
 <p>
  I don’t know his past, but I could guess the gist of it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright, alright.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle, fluttering beside me, nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  I reached for the window floating in my vision.

 <p>
  “Prepare yourself.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist placed his hand on the surface of the engraving stone.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes (Choose) / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  Buzzz.
 </p>
 <p>
  The white inscription stone began to vibrate.
 </p>
 <p>
  The white aura emanating from the engraving stone climbed up Velkist’s right arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eventually, it headed for Velkist’s head.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Engraving starts!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Instantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Gah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist knelt.

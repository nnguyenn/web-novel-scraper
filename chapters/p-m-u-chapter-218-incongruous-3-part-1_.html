 <p>
  Velkist lay flat on the floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  He clenched his hands into fists.
 </p>

 <p>
  He was straining so hard that his entire forearm was trembling.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Danger!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Velkist (★★★★)’ is beginning to become contaminated!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ka… hak…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A hissing sound escaped from Velkist’s gaping mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Black veins emerged beside his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clearly contaminated.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Not yet.’
 </p>
 <p>
  During the process of engraving a high-level imprint, it was inevitable to go through a state of contamination at least once.
 </p>
 <p>
  From now on, it was crucial. If he could overcome it, he would become the master of the imprint. If he couldn’t…
 </p>
 <p>
  Sreeung.
 </p>
 <p>
  I half-drew the sword from the sheath Velkist had given me.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He still has his reason.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Although his face was twisted in pain, there was still light in his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud! Thud-thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist slammed his fist on the floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  After a few more hits, blood began to seep through his clenched fists.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Danger!]

 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, be careful! A contaminated hero cannot be recovered.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Riiiip.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a tearing sound, black veins appeared all over his body.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist vomited black, viscous blood from his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;I told you so! Cancel it now! He hasn’t completely crossed over yet!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Goo Goo Con hurriedly approached Velkist.
 </p>
 <p>
  The pigeon tried to push away the glowing white orb near Velkist.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Stop, Ra.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist grabbed Goo Goo Con’s wing.

 <p>
  “It’s not… over yet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist brought the orb to his abdomen as if embracing it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then he muttered in a voice mixed with a metallic sound.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I… I need… to become stronger….”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;This madman! He’s lost his mind. What are you doing, Han?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The pigeon looked at me with fierce eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  I continued to watch Velkist, with my sword half-drawn.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t stop him.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist looked up at me with bloodshot eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is… my chosen path. I’ll take responsibility.”

  “Just dying won’t count as responsibility.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course….”
 </p>
 <p>
  Cough!
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist vomited black blood once more.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I decided to die on the battlefield.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So I won’t die in such a disgraceful manner.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The sound of Velkist gritting his teeth echoed throughout the room.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It wasn’t from the beginning.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I recalled Eloka’s precedent.

 <p>
  In terms of efficiency, she shouldn’t have participated in the Sea Dragon subjugation.
 </p>
 <p>
  But she begged me several times to let her fight with us.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is no different.
 </p>
 <p>
  A 2% chance gamble.
 </p>
 <p>
  I once again indulged a comrade’s whim.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, there’s no turning back now.
 </p>
 <p>
  If I stop here, Velkist will resent me for the rest of his life.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Thank you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist looked at me and managed a difficult smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sighed deeply.

 <p>
  Now, all I could do was watch to see what would happen to him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack!
 </p>
 <p>
  The sound of bones dislocating.
 </p>
 <p>
  The skin tore, and pure white scales emerged from the gaps.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist let out a silent scream.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack. From his temples, white horny growths started to emerge.
 </p>
 <p>
  They resembled those of the legitimate successor of Assinis, Delphine.
 </p>
 <p>
  I gripped the sword handle tightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The contamination was still progressing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Black blood flowed from his eyes down his entire body.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-7" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  The characteristic black veins of a contaminated person were so prominent they protruded outside the skin. The moment these veins invaded the heart, he would turn into a monster.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Not yet.’
 </p>
 <p>
  White dragon scales and horns continued to emerge.
 </p>
 <p>
  The jewel-like sparkling white scales gradually covered Velkist’s skin.
 </p>
 <p>
  The black veins receded as if pushed back by the white dragon’s aura.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Ha, this is….&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Goo Goo Con exhaled as if in disbelief.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is it a success?’
 </p>
 <p>
  But something was off.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was different from my experience. When I engraved the black dragon blood, it seeped in naturally.
 </p>

 <p>
  But the white dragon’s blood seemed to be rampaging inside Velkist.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist occasionally twitched his body, but showed no other reaction, as if he had already fainted.
 </p>
 <p>
  Through his torn clothes, his flesh and bones were exposed.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you didn’t look closely, you wouldn’t recognize who he was.
 </p>
 <p>
  “….”
 </p>
 <p>
  Twitch.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist, who was lying down, moved his fingers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, slowly, he began to rise.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;He’s here.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Goo Goo Con took a few steps back from Velkist.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist’s eyelids lifted as he stood still.
 </p>
 <p>
  Silver eyes that seemed to pierce through everything.
 </p>
 <p>
  His mouth opened and closed.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;This body is pathetic.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The first words from Velkist’s mouth were sincere complaints.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;It’s lacking in functionality, durability, and potential. It’s far from drawing out my power.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;I agree.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Goo Goo Con scratched his wing with his front paw.
 </p>
 <p>
  I laughed bitterly.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Are you Han of Islat?&gt;
 </p>

 <p>
  The ancestor of the four great families, Assinis, who had possessed Velkist, looked at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  A look of surprise crossed Assinis’ eyes as he scanned me.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;You have better qualities than I expected. I thought that swindler was lying again.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Who are you calling a swindler?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;But why… do I have to inhabit such a flawed person? There is a suitable body right in front of me.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s the difference between him and me? We are all the same.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The white dragon Assinis had an endlessly languid look in his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  I continued speaking.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sorry to say this at our first meeting, but help him out. He tries hard and won’t cause any trouble.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Again, this body is pathetic. It feels like I made a bad purchase.&gt;
 </p>

 <p>
  “So what.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;I want to change my master. Please release me.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s not possible.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;If I use my full power, this guy will die instantly.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Maybe now, but who knows later.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;I didn’t descend to play word games. To save Townia, I need a more efficient body.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “You won’t really know. He might become incredibly strong.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Assinis tilted his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;This is all in your favor, so why refuse? This guy can’t even properly contain me. Are you going to say he might change later too?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, so what?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Huh…&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Assinis smirked sinisterly.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;What a fool. You can’t even take what’s given.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “….”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Alright. If you want to make this guy stronger that badly, do as you wish.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Assinis lowered his eyes and said.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;From now on, the power of the White Dragon King, Deltaari Assinis, belongs to this guy.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack.
 </p>
 <p>
  The horn that had sprouted from his temple disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  So did the white scales and the black veins that signaled contamination.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Huhuhu… But, I wonder how far he can go.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Assinis’ eyes closed.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment, Velkist staggered and collapsed against the wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ta-da!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Engraving is complete.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [A special ability is inscribed in ‘Velkist (★★★★)’s body!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally, the engraving message appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no failure.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the subsequent explanation made me sigh.
 </p>
 <p>
  [True White Dragon Blood (S, Lv.1)]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Blood that proves the pure lineage of the ancient white dragon. It holds unprecedented power.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Unique Skill: 1. White Dragon Horn]
 </p>
 <p>
  [※ There are many unknown skills.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Note 1 – ‘True White Dragon Blood’ cannot be used for some reason.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The worst-case scenario of falling into contamination was avoided.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, it was hard to call this a success.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s sealed.’

 <p>
  The worst-case scenario of falling into contamination was avoided.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, it was hard to call this a success.

 <p>
  ‘It’s sealed.’
 </p>
 <p>
  When an imprint inappropriate for a hero’s level is bestowed, even if the engraving succeeds, the ability will be sealed.
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, the engraving was half-success, half-failure.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the visible chance was 2%, I predicted Velkist would not die.
 </p>
 <p>
  If Assinis had completely rejected Velkist, there would have been signs in the descent dungeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the white dragon entrusted him with the engraving stone. It was proof that he was willing to enter his body to some extent.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a gamble, but not a baseless one.
 </p>
 <p>
  “….”
 </p>
 <p>
  After a while, Velkist opened his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a hoarse voice, Velkist spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What happened?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You can see for yourself. You’re alive.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I tossed Velkist his sheath.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist caught it with his right hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t feel much.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Assinis is definitely within you. You just can’t sense it because it’s faint. You don’t have the same affinity as he does. Did you really think you could fully use his power?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Goo Goo Con approached Velkist.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If I can’t use it, what’s the point?”

 <p>
  &lt;That’s just for now.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can it be overcome through training?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Not with something like this. Can a human twist their neck 180 degrees no matter how much they train? It’s the same logic. You can’t handle the white dragon blood.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  “In that case….”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;There is a secret art passed down in the Assinis family. It’s called the Dragon Strength Technique. It’s a ritual that makes a human body closer to that of a dragon. Assinis successors have received the Dragon Strength Technique for generations.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the first I had heard of it.
 </p>
 <p>
  But it wasn’t an outlandish story. The Assinis successor Delphine didn’t have the appearance of an ordinary human either.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;You are on your own for the next part. I don’t know anything else! I’m out!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Goo Goo Con turned his back.
 </p>

 <p>
  And waddled his fat bottom through the slightly open door.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’m on my own, huh.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, considering everything, it’s clear what Velkist needs right now.
 </p>
 <p>
  “As you can see, you can’t use the engraving in your current state.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seems so. There’s no reaction.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Velkist.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I opened my mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “For the time being, step out of the first party. Don’t participate in missions. Don’t train either. Don’t even help the newcomers. Since you ate something so expensive, you need to make it worth it. Don’t come back until you can properly use the white dragon blood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “As Goo Goo Con said, if you undergo the Assinis secret art, you should be able to use the engraving.”
 </p>

 <p>
  Even if that happens, he won’t be able to use it perfectly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The rest will be up to Velkist himself. Just like when I practiced with the black dragon blood, he will have to become accustomed to the ability through trial and error. He will likely cross life and death several times during that process.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist, listening quietly to my words, muttered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, you’re telling me to stay in the exploration dungeon. How much time do I have?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not much. Come back before we go to the 50th floor.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s tight.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Currently, it’s unknown what state the Assinis family is in after their troops were annihilated.
 </p>
 <p>
  They might have been destroyed by the invasion of the Church’s army. Or, they might be unable to reach the area where Assinis is due to the exploration dungeon’s wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if Assinis is safe and Velkist visits them there, it’s obvious how they will react to Velkist asking them to hand over their special secrets.

 <p>
  But Velkist didn’t say he won’t do it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That guy said he was curious about how far you could go. This is the minimum condition you need to meet to use the engraving.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If I’m not with you, who will take my place?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There are many candidates. Don’t worry about it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist closed his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then he spoke as if spitting out the words.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So… I’ve finally stood on the same ground.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The same ground?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I also get to roll the dice now. Like you and that spear user.”

 <p>
  Velkist muttered, looking up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How far can I go? I was really curious about that too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Clack.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist, who had attached the sheath to his belt, stood up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll be back in two weeks.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you leaving right now? No goodbyes to the others?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that necessary?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Neryssa will be disappointed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist smirked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “As if.”
 </p>

 <p>
  Velkist left the room without hesitation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon after, I heard the sound of the training hall door opening.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Self-Action activated!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, the hero ‘Velkist (★★★★)’ has begun an exploration!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [A stipend has been automatically distributed to the hero. 10,000G has been spent.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tips/ If you want to stop the autonomous hero, turn off the ‘Self-Action’ function!]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Two weeks, huh.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s best to set the 50th-floor climbing date around that time.
 </p>
 <p>
  We should clear up to the 49th floor beforehand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Move faster! Quickly!”

 <p>
  “I’ll try!”
 </p>
 <p>
  On my way back to the dormitory from the private practice room, I suddenly heard unfamiliar voices from downstairs.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘….’
 </p>
 <p>
  There were stairs leading down to the lower floor of the training hall.
 </p>
 <p>
  I lightly stepped on the stairs and looked down.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good, just like that!”
 </p>
 <p>
  There, five men and women were sweating in a circle in an open space.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each held a practice weapon. They moved busily, drawing a large circle.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was formation practice.
 </p>
 <p>
  They swung their wooden swords and moved their feet as if there were monsters in front of them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though it was late at night, they were still practicing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Currently, we rarely do group training.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first party members had each established their own fighting style and surpassed the stage of relying on formations. The physical training we used to do every morning had slowed down as our physical abilities increased. Sparring had also become rare, and there were few opportunities to meet during training.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…This brings back memories.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If Velkist achieves his goal and returns, the training hall might once again look like it did back then.
 </p>
 <p>
  I watched them sweating and rolling in the open space and returned only when the morning dawned.

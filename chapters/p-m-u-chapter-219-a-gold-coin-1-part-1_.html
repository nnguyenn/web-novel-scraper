  Until Velkist returned from the exploration dungeon, his absence was filled by a hero named Bennick from the second party.
 </p>
 <p>
  Originally, Edis had volunteered to substitute after hearing about Velkist’s departure, but she was responsible for commanding all the heroes outside of the first party. Unless absolutely necessary, she couldn’t be hastily deployed for missions.

 <p>
  Bennick, who joined the second party after clearing the 20th floor, was a thief class known for his calm demeanor and cool-headed judgment. He was also someone Edis recommended.
 </p>
 <p>
  At least, he should be able to handle himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Though there might not be any fighting.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked up.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Floor 47.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Mission Type – Exploration]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Objective – Investigate an Unfamiliar Place!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The mission objective window was displayed.
 </p>
 <p>
  An exploration mission type I had experienced several times before.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nothing special.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So it’s a reconnaissance mission.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The current time was bright midday.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sun was shining from the clearing where we were first summoned.
 </p>
 <p>
  But now it was pitch dark. The branches of a gigantic tree extending a hundred meters up were blocking the sky. This place in the middle of the forest was as dark as night.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Quack! Quack-quack!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked to the side.
 </p>
 <p>
  Monsters were shrieking in the dark, dense forest.
 </p>
 <p>
  Their eyes glimmered ominously. If not for the transparent barrier between us, I would have been in a fierce battle with them by now.

 <p>
  Only observation.
 </p>
 <p>
  The monsters outside the barrier couldn’t touch the heroes, so the heroes could stroll along the inner paths of the field, easily assessing the enemy’s strength for the next mission. It had been a while since we had such a traditional mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It doesn’t look any different.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The leaves under my feet crumbled.
 </p>
 <p>
  The fallen leaves scattered throughout the forest path were pitch black, and the blackened trees were grotesquely twisted.
 </p>
 <p>
  And,
 </p>
 <p>
  Uooohhhh.
 </p>
 <p>
  An unidentified monster was wandering on the left side of the forest.
 </p>
 <p>
  Its body, extending above the trees, was at least 30 meters tall.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a large one.

 <p>
  ‘There are many.’
 </p>
 <p>
  They were hiding all over the forest.
 </p>
 <p>
  The lush branches were shaking in all directions, and the bushes were constantly rustling.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as I was watching them, they were also watching me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I narrowed my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hundreds of meters ahead, a rounded object resembling a high-rise building stood tall.
 </p>
 <p>
  Its shell pulsated as if it were about to hatch soon.
 </p>
 <p>
  The forest, once serene, had turned into a place of horror due to that egg.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It seems all the monsters in Townia have been mobilized.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Near the egg, shadows towering high swayed.

 <p>
  Dozens to hundreds of large monsters.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were eagerly waiting for intruders.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the sky visible through the gaps in the trees, numerous dots floated.
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, they were flying monsters.
 </p>
 <p>
  Known as the nemesis of airships.
 </p>
 <p>
  How many are there?
 </p>
 <p>
  I roughly counted the heads of the monsters I had seen while passing by.
 </p>
 <p>
  The number was not in the tens or hundreds.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thousands.
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering the hidden ones, it could be in the tens of thousands.

 <p>
  ‘Too many.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Since clearing the 45th floor, we have steadily increased its forces.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a result, Townia could muster a massive force unmatched to before.
 </p>
 <p>
  But even then, it was only a few hundred.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;The 50th floor is the turning point. If you win this battle, you can easily surpass the 60th floor. The enemy would have used all the forces from the upper floors.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Goo Goo Con had said.
 </p>
 <p>
  He speculated that the prince who could interfere with missions had used the monsters from the upper floors.
 </p>
 <p>
  If we could clear the 50th floor, the following missions would be easy.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s easier said than done.’
 </p>
 <p>
  This meant the mission difficulty on the 50th floor would be beyond imagination.

 <p>
  It’s not just the number of monsters. I recalled the two named monsters that had troubled me.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Beast King and the Saintess who were former heroes. They were likely to appear on the 50th floor. Considering the gravity of the situation, even the prince, the boss of the 80th floor, might show up.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No more.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even with resources, it’s impossible.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the current account level, we couldn’t increase our forces any further.
 </p>
 <p>
  Only after breaking through the 50th floor, conducting research, and significantly expanding our facilities once more could we manage thousands of heroes.
 </p>
 <p>
  The absence of the Assinis family was deeply felt.
 </p>
 <p>
  If they were here, they would have been excellent shields.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They said they were in seclusion.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria had told me after visiting the Assinis family.

 <p>
  Priasis, who succeeded in escaping to the surface with our help on the 46th floor, had visited the Assinis family again.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the head of Assinis, shocked by the loss of his heir, declared that he would no longer involve himself in the empire and the church’s affairs, effectively rendering Assinis out of our reach.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He said he was sorry.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t count how many times I heard that from Pria.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unable to persuade them, Pria had looked at me with a near-crying expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  And now, she was patrolling the forest outskirts with the other members of the first party.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kiiik! Kiiik! Kikik!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kang! Kangkang! Kang!
 </p>
 <p>
  Goblins that appeared on the forest path bared their teeth at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  They relentlessly stabbed their daggers into the transparent barrier between us.

 <p>
  It was a futile effort, but they didn’t stop. Blue sparks scattered from the wall where the blades were embedded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kaaaak! Kaakak!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Corrupted Goblin Lv.38] X 31
 </p>
 <p>
  Their once green skin had turned black.
 </p>
 <p>
  Their bodies were bulging with hideous veins.
 </p>
 <p>
  Level 38. The monsters here were not only numerous but also significantly stronger.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘……Sigh.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I could only sigh.

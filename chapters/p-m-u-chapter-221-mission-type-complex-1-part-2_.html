  [Han, we must win!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle, with a victory headband tied on her forehead, pointed at me.

 <p>
  [No matter who it is or what tricks they pull!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled.
 </p>
 <p>
  It had always been like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  Winning…
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Dimensional Rift’ and ‘Dimensional Gap’ are connecting!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Winning is what we do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis finished her speech.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Successful speech!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The raid’s morale increased!]
 </p>
 <p>
  For someone who said she couldn’t give a speech, she did quite well.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Everyone, board!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang.
 </p>
 <p>
  The stairs of the five airships descended simultaneously.
 </p>
 <p>
  The waiting heroes began boarding the decks.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s spectacular. Fighting with so many people.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s no need to worry. We just have to do our part.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s true, but still.”

 <p>
  Hundreds of heroes, each armed, boarded the airships in a rush.
 </p>
 <p>
  Their eyes showed determination, fear, and various other emotions.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a way, it was a magnificent sight, just like Jenna said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re fighting to save Townia and return home, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna took a deep breath.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright. Let’s go save Townia!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The airship we were boarding was Townia’s second airship and the lead ship of the fleet, the small-sized Lusette.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lusette was a transport-type airship built to deploy Party 1 in the operational area, enhancing its mobility and defense at the expense of armament.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Welcome aboard! We are ready to depart!&gt;
 </p>

 <p>
  As we boarded the deck, a lively girl’s voice echoed.
 </p>
 <p>
  We owed her a debt during the occupation battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s just us here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna looked around.
 </p>
 <p>
  This airship was scheduled to be deployed in the most dangerous part of the battlefield.
 </p>
 <p>
  The main force heroes were boarding the other four airships, excluding Lusette.
 </p>
 <p>
  The flagship of the raid, where Edis and the command staff would board, was Capitalism.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Open the Rift!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Not far away, light shimmered as a gigantic mirror the size of a building began to move.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then, letters appeared on the mirror.
 </p>

 </p>
 <p>
  Once we entered that mirror, the mission would begin.
 </p>
 <p>
  The airships, carrying around 400 troops, were checking their personnel and doing final inspections.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;This is Party 2. Is everyone okay? We’re about to depart.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis’s voice echoed.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no response on the communication channel.
 </p>
 <p>
  It meant there were no issues with personnel.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Then, let’s depart.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>

 <p>
  The Lusette, parked at the front of the airship fleet, began to float.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s starting.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I took a deep breath.
 </p>
 <p>
  I calmed the blood raging through my veins.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since falling into Townia, this was the largest mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  Vroom!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Lusette accelerated.
 </p>
 <p>
  The mirror, the portal to the mission field, was right ahead.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, starting the mission!]
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Let’s go!&gt;

 <p>
  Along with the lively voice of the mechanic,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Lusette plunged into the Dimensional Mirror.
 </p>
 <p>
  I squinted my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the light in front of me receded, a cold wind brushed my cheeks.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The field is…’
 </p>
 <p>
  A forest.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our starting position was in the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Lusette was cruising hundreds of meters above the forest.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, in the distance, a gigantic egg was spewing black blood non-stop.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash.

  As the light shimmered, one by one, airships belonging to Townia started appearing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So many damn monsters.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist muttered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking down over the railing,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Monster Army Lv.???] X 8325
 </p>
 <p>
  Throughout the forest.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were so many monsters that there wasn’t even a place to step.
 </p>
 <p>

 <p>
  [Use tactical tools to designate tactical targets for the fleet!]

 <p>
  &lt;It’s okay. Ignore the monsters below. We’re in the air. Just watch out for the ones that can fly and approach the egg.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis was communicating with the entire raid.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;But Han, didn’t you say the princess and the key are needed to handle the egg?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Pria will appear once the conditions are met.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;You mean through mission adjustment.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  We’ll find out the conditions for Pria’s appearance as we progress through the mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Alright, let’s go.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Vroom.
 </p>
 <p>
  The leading Lusette moved slowly.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Keep a certain distance between the airships to avoid friendly fire. And if you spot anything unusual…&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  About 50 meters ahead.
 </p>
 <p>
  Someone was floating in the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Danger!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Black Prince]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Prayos Al Ragnar Lv.354]
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;…Never mind, I guess we don’t have to look.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis cut off the communication.
 </p>
 <p>
  The prince was wrapped like a mummy, covered in bright red bandages, and draped in a black coat.
 </p>
 <p>
  His mouth twitched.

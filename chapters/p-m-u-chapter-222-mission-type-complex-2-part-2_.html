  ‘It won’t end here.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I placed my hand on the hilt of Bifrost.

 <p>
  [Danger!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [A Dark Dimensional Portal is forming!]
 </p>
 <p>
  On the deck of the airship, gliding through the sky,
 </p>
 <p>
  A black hole twisted open.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kiyaaah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Corrupted Goblin Lv.38] X 315

 </p>
 <p>
  [Corrupted Human Soldier Lv.45] X 76
 </p>
 <p>
  [Corrupted…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Monsters of all kinds began to pour out from the hole, falling onto the airship’s deck.
 </p>
 <p>
  The goblin at the front clung to the Lucette’s side.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Activate the electric barrier!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Here we go! One million volts!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle, crackle!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Screee!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The goblin, roasted by electricity, fell hundreds of meters below.
 </p>
 <p>
  High-voltage currents flowed through all parts of the airship except the deck and interior.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was an installation to prevent monsters from climbing aboard.

  “It’s time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist quietly drew his sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dozens of monsters were also falling on this side.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmph!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha, baring her fangs, bumped her fists together.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Unique Skill, Bestial Transformation (Transcendent) activated!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Kishasha (★★★★)’ is transforming!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Roar!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha roared.

  Transcendent Bestial Transformation. It allows retaining a human form while gaining the physical abilities of a beast.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the upper stage of the existing bestial transformation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Furry tiger ears sprouted from her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha wagged the tail emerging from her bottom and clenched her fists.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Tiger Punch!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha thrust her fist upwards.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  With the sound of a bomb exploding, pieces of monster flesh and blood rained down across the deck.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t waste your strength from the start.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I know, Han! This is just warming up.”

 <p>
  A soldier fell off the edge of the deck.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was clad in steel armor with a helmet pressed down. No sanity could be seen in the eyes beyond the armor.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Rawr!”
 </p>
 <p>
  He lunged with his spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Slash. I drew Bifrost and sliced upwards simultaneously.
 </p>
 <p>
  The soldier’s torso, severed instantly, fell off the airship.
 </p>
 <p>
  I wiped the blood off my cheek and spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Each of you, take a designated area and clear the monsters. As I said earlier, our job isn’t to deal with the small fry. Don’t waste unnecessary strength, handle them with minimal effort. I’ll take the rear of the deck. Kishasha, you handle the center, Velkist, the front. Jenna, continue with the support fire, and Katiio, conserve your magic and rest.”
 </p>
 <p>
  There were no verbal responses, but everyone moved according to my instructions.
 </p>
 <p>
  I walked to the rear of the deck with my sword drawn. Just in time, a lizardman was falling.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Ki-rak!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  With a light jab from my left hand, the lizardman’s head disappeared, and its body staggered before collapsing.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Not many monsters on this side.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The monsters emerging from the dark fissures were concentrating on the main attack force.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially on the flagship of the attack force, Capitalism, hundreds of monsters were clinging. The heroes were fighting fiercely on the deck.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I could create a path to the first ship.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio, who was hiding inside the deck, suggested.
 </p>
 <p>
  I shook my head. If we were to fall under this level of attack, it would render the strategy pointless.
 </p>

 <p>
  The evolution score had increased by 3 points.
 </p>
 <p>
  The egg was still swinging its tentacles, devouring monsters.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Maintain the basic formation! Group up by party units! Injured heroes, get inside the ship for treatment immediately!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The messages about injured heroes kept popping up.
 </p>
 <p>
  The number of monsters assaulting the airship was already close to a thousand.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, not a single hero had died yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘We can do this.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The exchange rate between heroes and monsters was at least 100 to 1.
 </p>
 <p>
  At this rate, we could hold out even if tens of thousands of monsters attacked, not just ten thousand.
 </p>
 <p>
  If we were surrounded on the ground, it would be tough, but here in the sky, it was our stage.

  Anytng, who had opened the tactical menu, was steadily replenishing the airship with supplies.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if we used up all of it, it wouldn’t matter.
 </p>
 <p>
  Townia’s equipment workshop, which resembled a large factory, was continually producing additional supplies.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Second wave, switch!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  There was a shift change on the deck.
 </p>
 <p>
  The second squad, who had been conserving their strength inside, swapped positions with the first squad, who had been fighting intensely.
 </p>
 <p>
  Given the limited space on the airship, a shift system was the most efficient tactic in this situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;They’re not much. We can do this!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis shouted.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hero ‘Edis (★★★★)’ encourages the team!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The morale of the attack force rises!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s still dull.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist decapitated three soldiers in one swing.
 </p>
 <p>
  The deck of the Lucette was also piling up with monster corpses. Any that made it through the electric barrier were dealt with quickly. The number of monsters successfully landing on the deck wasn’t very high.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;There doesn’t seem to be anything on the forest boundary.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis sent a private message.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first fleet of Townia, while fighting monsters, had circled the edge of the field, but there were no noticeable objects like goddess statues.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It must be inside.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the inner part of the forest, where the egg was writhing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ominous clouds were covering various parts.
 </p>

  ‘We’ll have to break through those clouds.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed, the object wouldn’t be outside.
 </p>
 <p>
  That would be too easy.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;We’re heading inside.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis ended the communication.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shortly after,
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Orders relayed! We’re entering the forest! It’s a bit scary, though…!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The Lucette began to change direction.

  Gunfire exploded incessantly, and flames painted the sky a crimson hue.
 </p>
 <p>
  Countless monsters soared from the ground or leapt from dimensional rifts on the airship, descending onto the deck.

 <p>
  Townia’s fleet of airships was advancing deeper into the forest, enduring the relentless attacks of the monsters.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kyaaa!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Two goblins with dark red skin charged at me from both sides, wielding daggers.
 </p>
 <p>
  I stepped back, letting the dagger blades slice through the air in front of me. I swiftly swung Bifrost.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Screeech!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The goblins’ bodies split apart, falling lifelessly onto the deck.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had already dealt with dozens of monsters.
 </p>
 <p>
  But this wasn’t enough to make a dent.
 </p>
 <p>
  The other members of the 1st Party were in the same situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s fine.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though the Lucette and other airships had some injuries and damaged parts, they hadn’t suffered any critical hits. At this rate, we could hold out for hours, even if the enemies kept coming.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Current Evolution Level: 008 / 100]
 </p>
 <p>
  However, this mission was a time attack.
 </p>
 <p>
  We had to meet the mission criteria within a set time limit.
 </p>
 <p>
  If we failed… we’d probably all be wiped out.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;“Suspicious clouds ahead! Charging through!”&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Crash!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Lucette plowed through the harpies blocking its path with the bow of the ship, moving forward rapidly.

 <p>
  Ahead, massive trees entwined like a coiled snake, with ominous purple clouds writhing above them.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;“Breaking through!”&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Lucette entered the sea of clouds,
 </p>
 <p>
  the entire airship was enveloped in a dense fog.

 </p>
 <p>
  I felt my body get slightly heavier.
 </p>
 <p>
  I furrowed my brows.
 </p>
 <p>
  A curse?

  &lt;“What is this?”&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis whispered through the private channel.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stat decrease. Don’t worry about it. 5% isn’t a big deal.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed there were penalties for entering deeper into the field.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this area, located at the forest’s edge, all heroes were experiencing a 5% stat decrease.
 </p>
 <p>
  The nest was still a ways off.
 </p>
 <p>
  If my prediction was correct, the debuffs would worsen the deeper we went.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ignore it and keep moving.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;“Understood.”&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Ending the call with Edis, I saw her issue commands through the command channel.

  The fleet, led by the Lucette, formed a wedge formation and advanced through the clouds.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though our surroundings turned hazy, visibility wasn’t significantly impaired.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kiyaaa!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom! Boom boom! Boom boom boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  The fleet, having withstood a heavy assault, scattered bombardment left and right.
 </p>
 <p>
  Monsters, turned into chunks of meat by the volley, continuously fell to the ground below.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Current Evolution Level: 011 / 100]
 </p>
 <p>
  While clearing monsters on the deck, I surveyed the first stage area.
 </p>
 <p>
  If there were any objects, they’d surely have markers. But even using my insight, I found no significant results.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Maybe in the next area.’

  The acrid air invaded my lungs.
 </p>
 <p>
  It felt like swallowing fire.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oppa, poison…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A poisoned status effect.

  “Katiio.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Leave it to me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio closed his eyes and crossed his hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  Threads of magic spread from his fingertips, creating a transparent barrier.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a unique air purification spell for magic users.
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally, I could breathe easier.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re fine now. But the other parties seem to have no way to cope!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not a deadly poison. As long as they take antidotes in time, they can withstand it.”

 <p>
  If it were a deadly poison, we’d have to escape immediately, but this status effect was a few levels lower.

 </p>
 <p>
  “We have no choice but to go on.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked down over the rail.
 </p>
 <p>
  A Chimera spewed flames from its mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  The crimson flames heated the underside of the Lucette.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kiyaaa!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thwack!
 </p>
 <p>
  An arrow from Jenna lodged into the Chimera’s throat, stopping its flames.

  The debuffs were piling up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon, casualties would start occurring.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Raqil (★★★)’ has returned to the embrace of the goddess! His spirit will be remembered forever.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The first casualty on the heroes’ side had occurred.
 </p>
 <p>
  A monster had clung to the deck, causing them to fall together.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Danger!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Additional dimensional rifts are forming!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s getting crowded.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist muttered while cutting down a troll.
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed, more monsters were pouring out of the dimensional rifts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flying monsters were now starting to penetrate the bombardment net and enter.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;“Don’t panic. We can still hold on. Maintain formation!”&gt;
 </p>
 <p>

 <p>
  ‘…Damn it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I brought my hand to my ear.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Retreat immediately! Go back to the second area!”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;“O-Okay!”&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Wailing sirens blared.
 </p>
 <p>
  The fleet, having just entered the third area, frantically turned back.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘50% stat decrease and deadly poison?’
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;“Aaaah!”&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  I grabbed the railing.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Lucette shot upwards.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crash!
 </p>
 <p>
  A hundred-meter-long maw snapped shut.
 </p>

  We couldn’t operate here.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the heroes’ stats halved and facing deadly poison, not to mention the maw’s activity, the Townia fleet wouldn’t last ten minutes.

 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  Edis’s voice lacked confidence.
 </p>
 <p>
  I crossed my arms.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait. I’m thinking.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The escalation of the debuff was too steep.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jumping from 10% to 50% was excessive. Five times the penalty?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There must be something in the third area.’

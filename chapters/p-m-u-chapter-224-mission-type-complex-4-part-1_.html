 <p>
  I looked ahead.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Beast King Kiadni was a middle-aged giant over 2 meters tall with bulging muscles. His mane-like hair and protruding sharp fangs gave him a fierce appearance.

 <p>
  The leader of the Church, Saintess Liane, stood quietly with her eyes closed, wearing a robe marked with the symbol of Tel and Ikar.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the spectator’s seat, the prince looked down at us with an indifferent gaze.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You defeated that crazy witch, I see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kiadni continued speaking.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Very good! It’s been a while since I felt this excitement. Show me your strength! Show me how much you’ve grown….”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kiadni’s gaze turned to Kishasha.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha bit her lip silently.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I will watch closely.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kiadni grinned and clenched his right hand, which was as large as a mace.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;No matter how strong you are, it will be difficult to face the heroes blessed by the goddess all at once. I will support you.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t care!”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;It is an order from His Highness the Prince.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Kiadni’s face showed a moment of displeasure before he laughed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Liane stepped forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Heroes, we are still bound by the curse. But if you fail this time… the situation will be a bit different. Please be careful.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Liane bowed her head to us.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Warning!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Warning!]

  [Warning!]
 </p>
 <p>
  A triple warning message appeared, signaling the arrival of a formidable enemy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Woooong.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the sky above the arena, a white light began to ripple.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Configuring the field.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  A long object shot out from the light and embedded itself in the sandy ground of the arena.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a statue of a goddess praying in a solemn posture, something we had seen countless times before.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The blessing of the goddess descends upon the entire field!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Wooooong!

 <p>
  The goddess statue trembled once and then emitted light.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Goddess statue’s divine power – 50%]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Blessing granted – Prayer of Purification]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Debuffs applied to the entire area of Chaos Depths have been removed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  I finally grasped the rules of this mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  I spoke to the members who were looking tense.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Listen carefully. Our goal is to protect this goddess statue while dealing with those guys. We need to clear a path for the main force. As long as we protect the statue, the main force can enter the field without being affected by the curse.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I checked the message on the right side of my view once more.
 </p>
 <p>
  The divine power was at 50%, and the blessing called “Prayer of Purification” was applied. This blessing would nullify the debuffs.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The divine power can increase or decrease depending on the conditions. The problem is….’

 <p>
  I looked at the two bosses.
 </p>
 <p>
  Liane seemed to understand my intentions and smiled lightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Don’t worry. We cannot interfere with the goddess statue. But they can.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Liane pointed to the wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I shifted my gaze, a black dimensional gate was wriggling there.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Corrupted Human Soldier Lv.53] X 17
 </p>
 <p>
  [Corrupted Human Knight Lv.61] X 3
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon, soldiers began to emerge from the dimensional gate.
 </p>
 <p>
  Their eyes, devoid of reason, were fixed on the goddess statue.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So we have to protect the goddess statue from monsters while fighting the bosses.’

  If we performed well, we would receive a bonus; if we failed, we would face a penalty.
 </p>
 <p>
  The rules were clear.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;The curse has been lifted. What happened?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m a bit too busy to explain. We won’t be able to return for a while. Just head deeper into the forest.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I cut off communication with Edis and spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll split into defense and attack teams. The defense team will protect the goddess statue, and the attack team will go out and fight the bosses. The defense team will be Jenna, Katiio, and Velkist. The attack team will be me and Kishasha.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist looked at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I shook my head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kishasha is better suited to face the Beast King than you are.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Alright.”

  “Form a formation, but don’t be too rigid. We can be affected by each other’s imprints.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Everyone nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Formation and cooperation were necessary, but there was no need to cling to it excessively.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had the Black Dragon’s blood, and Velkist had the White Dragon’s blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, with Kishasha’s transcendent beast transformation and Jenna’s Wind Arrow blessing, along with our other excellent skills, it was clear that the time to adhere strictly to formations had passed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Monster Wave!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Round 1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Soldiers jumped down from the wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  They approached the goddess statue, brandishing their weapons.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;…Hehe.&gt;

 <p>
  Liane, who was watching us, smiled softly.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;You are incredibly strong. Have you fully accepted the goddess’s blessing? I can understand why Perseine lost.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  As she said.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each member of Party 1 was close to being a human weapon.
 </p>
 <p>
  They could each handle hundreds of such small fry on their own.
 </p>
 <p>
  I lowered my sword and stepped forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha followed beside me.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘When I signal… strike all at once.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even without words, our intentions were understood.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha nodded.

  My skill and engraving setup were specialized for short-term battles.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no need to drag this out.
 </p>
 <p>
  I planned to end it with maximum output from the beginning.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hahaha. You want to end this feast right away?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kiadni slowly walked towards us, a twisted smile on his lips.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The more delicious the feast, the longer you should enjoy it. To do that, why not get rid of the unnecessary decorations? Both you and I.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Feast, my foot.
 </p>
 <p>
  I spread my left hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Halkion.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;You call me so late!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle!
 </p>
 <p>
  Dark red lightning started crackling from my left arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  The precursor to the activation of the Black Dragon’s blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;…&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;To the heavens and the earth. Death will come equally to all.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hahaha! It’s a warrior’s fight! Let’s enjoy it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  Kiadni stomped his foot.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sand pit rose high, and his massive body rushed at me with tremendous speed.
 </p>
 <p>
  I gripped Bifrost in a reverse grip.

  It was the stance for the activation of Soulblade Fusion.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I will end this in one blow.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I had no intention of playing along with trivial tricks.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle! Lightning gathered at the tip of Bifrost.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Die.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★★★★)’ has entered the Ascend state!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Unique skill, ‘Black Dragon’s Scale’ activated!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Skill, ‘Soulblade Fusion’ activated!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Flames imbued with lightning enveloped the sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kiadni was swinging his fist right in front of me.

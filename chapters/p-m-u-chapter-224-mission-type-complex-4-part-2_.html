  [‘The Left Eye that Ravages the Heavens’]
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment, a violet eye appeared above the arena.
 </p>

 <p>
  “…?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The flames at the tip of the sword vanished.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hahahaha!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Right in front of me, Kiadni’s fist was about to smash into my face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Han! Be careful!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha, who intervened between Kiadni and me, countered his fist.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  Unable to withstand the impact, Kishasha rolled across the dirt ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  I quickly stepped back.
 </p>
 <p>
  “….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s wrong? Are you surprised that you can’t use your strength?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kiadni dusted off his fist and sneered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry. I can’t use my abilities either. It’s a fair fight!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Status window.
 </p>
 <p>
  My state was immediately displayed as a hologram.
 </p>
 <p>
  All skills, except for intermediate swordsmanship, were grayed out.
 </p>
 <p>
  The engraving window, including the Black Dragon’s blood, was the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Unavailable.’

 <p>
  I chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  Above the arena, a burning eye surveyed the entire field.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Left Eye that Ravages the Heavens.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is an interesting pattern.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed I had to fight him barehanded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you think I would run away?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled and twirled my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Removing all the decorations and fighting head-on.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s the spirit of a true warrior!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kiadni, laughing boisterously, thrust his fist at me.

 <p>
  And.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  His body explosively charged at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The only usable skill is weapon technique.’
 </p>
 <p>
  No Black Dragon’s blood, no Ascend, no Soulblade Fusion, and no other skills.
 </p>
 <p>
  I swung my sword at Kiadni.
 </p>
 <p>
  His fist collided with the flat side of my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  “….!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I was pushed back several meters.
 </p>
 <p>
  It felt like my grip was being torn apart.

  [Corrupted Human Soldier Lv.53] X 23
 </p>
 <p>
  [Corrupted Human Knight Lv.61] X 5
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can’t use any skill. What’s going on?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ping!
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna’s arrow pierced the neck of a descending soldier.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her accuracy was still precise, but the power was lacking.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Formation….’

 <p>
  The three members of the defense team were scattered around the field.
 </p>
 <p>
  Normally, they would cover a wide range using engravings and skills, but….
 </p>
 <p>
  “Raaaaaah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A soldier screamed and charged at the goddess statue.
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as he touched the light emanating from the statue, his body melted away and vanished.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Goddess statue’s divine power has dropped to 48%!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Prayer of Purification has been lifted!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Debuffs are applied throughout the entire Chaos Depths!]

  I shouted through gritted teeth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Form a formation! Create a triangular formation near the goddess statue. Don’t let a single one through!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why can’t we use our skills…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this that woman’s ability?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  I shook my aching right hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems so.”
 </p>
 <p>
  All skills and engravings were unusable.
 </p>
 <p>
  This meant the battle would unfold like it did before the 20th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Han…!&gt;

 <p>
  Edis’s urgent voice rang out.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed she was showered with debuffs while progressing through the 3rd district.
 </p>
 <p>
  I raised my hand to my ear.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m sorry. It’s our fault. We’ll fix it soon, so hang in there.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;I’ll try to hold on!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis cut off communication.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Airship ‘Easy’ has been severely damaged!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Darren (★★★★)’ has returned to the goddess’s embrace! His determination will be remembered forever.]

 <p>
  A series of death messages for nearly a dozen heroes appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Damn.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The 4th airship, Easy, was severely damaged.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t completely incapacitated, but it had taken significant damage.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Current evolution rate: 034 / 100]
 </p>
 <p>
  I gritted my teeth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t let them in. If we fall, the main force is finished.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come this way!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna and Velkist hurriedly ran to the goddess statue near Katio.
 </p>
 <p>
  The three formed a triangular formation, brandishing their weapons.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Goddess statue’s divine power has risen to 51%!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Prayer of Purification has been granted!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Debuffs in the entire Chaos Depths have been lifted.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Only one monster had broken through the defensive line.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon, the debuffs were restored.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The divine power… seems to increase over time.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The longer the defense team held on, the more advantageous it was.
 </p>
 <p>
  They really made it annoying.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is it okay to let your guard down?”

 <p>
  “Of course not!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I stomped the ground hard enough to pile up the sand and swung my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a piercing sound, the blade slashed through the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  My sword and the Beast King’s fist collided.
 </p>
 <p>
  The impact made my body tremble momentarily.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s an interesting trick!”
 </p>
 <p>
  While struggling with me, Kiadni swung his back foot.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha, who was targeting the rear, flew dozens of meters away like a cannonball.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not yet…!”

 <p>
  Kishasha regained her posture mid-air and charged again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish. Sharp claws extended from Kishasha’s hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Han!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha slashed with her claws.
 </p>
 <p>
  I drew back my sword and thrust it forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our attacks intersected.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Haha!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Beast King, laughing heartily, twisted his body while leaping.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our attacks grazed the spot where Kiadni had been.
 </p>
 <p>
  Movements as nimble as his massive frame was large.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If all you’ve done up until now is rely on your engravings, you will never defeat me!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry about that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ve never clung to engravings.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ve always overcome crises with my own strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bifrost drew a graceful arc as it followed Kiadni.
 </p>
 <p>
  Skills and engravings.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nice to have, but….
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t need them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ve been through countless training sessions for this moment.

  ‘A fair fight.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Engravings and skills do not only apply to heroes. Monsters are the same. As the King of Beasts said, this fight will be determined solely by physical strength and weapon mastery.

  [Monster Wave!]

 <p>
  [Round 3.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Corrupted Human Soldier Lv.53] X 29
 </p>
 <p>
  [Corrupted Human Knight Lv.61] X 6
 </p>
 <p>
  I glanced back. Jenna was swiftly cutting down the soldiers with her daggers. Beside her, Velkist was finishing off the enemies she missed. On the other side, Katiio’s summoned sand golem was crushing the soldiers. The three formed a triangular formation, organically swapping positions and blocking the offensive perfectly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The situation was no different for Kishasha and me. The King of Beasts, having lost his abilities, was merely a powerful martial artist. His punches were certainly astonishingly strong and ferocious, capable of obliterating a skull if they landed properly. But this wasn’t my first time facing such punches.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha blocked the King of Beasts’ punch with her palm. The ground she stood on caved in, but she did not retreat. My blade targeted his throat immediately after.
 </p>
 <p>
  Slice.
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally, blood spurted. It was the first wound the King of Beasts received.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha ha ha!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The King of Beasts laughed loudly and threw another punch.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not a chance!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha thrust out her elbow. Bang! Her body slid back, but she didn’t get thrown off. I lowered my stance and charged forward from below her.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If Kishasha withstands the attack…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha’s martial arts had already reached a level of mastery. Thus, her physical abilities like strength and agility were far superior to mine. In close combat, she was beyond a 4-star, reaching a high level of 5-star.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack!
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha blocked another kick from the King of Beasts. During that time, I thrust my sword again.

 <p>
  ‘I will counterattack.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a simple strategy, but it required perfect coordination between the two of us.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Excellent!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Wounds began to accumulate on the King of Beasts’ body. The defense squad was also flawlessly repelling the monsters attacking the Goddess Statue.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Holy Power of the Goddess Statue increases to 62%!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Blessing of Radiance is bestowed!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [A buff is applied to the entire Chaos Depths!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Buff Applied – All hero abilities increase by 10%]
 </p>
 <p>
  The light emitted by the Goddess Statue became even more intense.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Han, we broke through Zone 4!&gt;

  “Keep going.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The field map in the upper right corner of my vision showed the position of the Townia fleet advancing into the depths of the forest.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Current Evolution Rate: 039 / 100]
 </p>
 <p>
  We were close to the egg. There was no need to forcefully deal with the King of Beasts. Just by holding out and increasing the holy power, the main force would take care of the target.
 </p>
 <p>
  “As expected! You have been training hard for a long time. Excellent combination!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The King of Beasts looked down at the back of his hand. Blood was flowing from the sword mark I had made.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;It seems this is not enough.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “I want to enjoy this a little longer. Can’t I?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;His Highness is getting bored.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then there’s no choice.”

 <p>
  Kiardni smirked.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He’s up to something again.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed we had broken through the first phase of the boss fight. I took a deep breath slowly. My stamina was sufficient.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No matter what comes, stay calm.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I had overcome the missions of Niflheimr and Townia as a master and hero. This wasn’t even considered a crisis.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Right Eye of the Earth Devourer’]
 </p>
 <p>
  Opposite the purple eye floating above the arena, a new orange eye appeared. Once more, a fiery gaze swept through the arena.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Show your fighting spirit!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kiardni clenched his fist and stomped the ground again. Kiardni was charging towards us. Our tactics remained unchanged. Kishasha would defend, and I would attack. But Kishasha stood motionless.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘……?’
 </p>

  She wasn’t moving to respond at all. Kishasha was fumbling in the air as if confused.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……Kishasha?”
 </p>
 <p>
  She turned her head towards me. The light had disappeared from Kishasha’s eyes. ‘This is……!’
 </p>
 <p>
  I urgently ran towards Kishasha. Kiardni’s fist was racing towards her face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Damn!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I forcibly intervened, deflecting the fist with the flat of my sword. An awkward posture. Snap. A disturbing sound accompanied my right arm joint bending the wrong way.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you doing!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can’t…… I can’t see!”
 </p>
 <p>
  She can’t see? I hurriedly pulled Kishasha back, holding her by the waist. A tearing pain surged from my right arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘My right arm…….’

 <p>
  It was broken. Damn it.
 </p>
 <p>
  I switched my sword to my left hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Holy Power of the Goddess Statue drops to 43%!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Blessing of Radiance and Prayer of Purification are canceled!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [A debuff is applied to the entire Chaos Depths!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The defense squad was also in chaos. Taking advantage of the gap where Katiio’s magic barrier was lifted, three soldiers infiltrated the Goddess Statue.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Why did this happen?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I quickly surveyed the members. Everyone’s movements were different from usual.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…….’
 </p>
 <p>
  I widened my eyes. I could see clearly. My vision was normal. I could hear as well.

  ‘What isn’t working…….’
 </p>
 <p>
  I lightly bit my tongue. A bitter sensation was transmitted to my brain, but I couldn’t taste the blood. Nor could I smell the metallic scent of blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I get it.’

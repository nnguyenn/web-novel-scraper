 <p>
  I widened my eyes. I could see clearly. My vision was normal. I could hear as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What isn’t working…….’

 <p>
  I lightly bit my tongue. A bitter sensation was transmitted to my brain, but I couldn’t taste the blood. Nor could I smell the metallic scent of blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I get it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I placed Kishasha on the ground. She started crawling on all fours in the sand. Meanwhile, Kiardni, who had been behind us, was already approaching.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If any of you can see, come to me!” I shouted to my party members.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you talking about all of a sudden?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna, who was drawing her bow, looked this way.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just come here!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna folded her bow and ran to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ll fight this guy with me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What about Kishasha?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “She can’t.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at Velkist. He was mechanically cutting down monsters, but he didn’t look this way when I shouted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can’t hear anything.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Right Eye of the Earth Devourer.’ A skill that steals a hero’s ‘senses’. Kishasha lost her vision and hearing, making her unable to respond to Kiardni’s attack.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It seems the stolen senses are chosen randomly.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I lost my sense of smell and taste.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Katiio also seems to be blind.’
 </p>

 <p>
  But it seems he can hear. He did look this way.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Two senses are taken.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I thought quickly. There’s no time to leisurely ponder.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Katiio, the second ability of the Saintess steals senses.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……So that’s it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Write this information on Kishasha and Velkist’s skin with magic. Both of them can’t hear. We’re going to switch the defense and attack squads. Those who can’t see will go to the defense squad. Those who can see will go to the attack squad and fight the King of Beasts.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But how can they defend if they can’t see…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  I stopped talking and ran. Bang! The King of Beasts’ fist crashed into where I had been.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re quite relaxed.”

 <p>
  No time for words. Kiardni bombarded me with relentless attacks. I dodged what I could and countered what I couldn’t, retreating backward.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ping!
 </p>
 <p>
  An arrow aimed at Kiardni’s philtrum. Crack! Kiardni bit down on the flying arrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s absurd.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna clicked her tongue. Kiardni spat out the broken arrow and laughed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The combination of that child and you was impressive. I wonder how this will go!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kiardni rushed at Jenna. Jenna swiftly drew her daggers and clashed with Kiardni.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The matchup isn’t favorable.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The King of Beasts’ skin was so tough it felt like stone, and it was hard for blades to penetrate without proper form. Clang! Clang!
 </p>
 <p>
  Kiardni deflected Jenna’s daggers and extended his fist. Jenna jumped high, but Kiardni leaped after her.

 <p>
  ‘Not good.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I ran, leaping like I was flying, and thrust my sword repeatedly at him.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Holy Power of the Goddess Statue drops to 34%!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The debuff applied to the entire Chaos Depths is strengthened!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist alone couldn’t block all sides. Soldiers were rushing towards the Goddess Statue from everywhere.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Airship ‘Fran’ has been severely damaged!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The message of the 5th airship Fran being severely damaged appeared. Following that were the death notifications of heroes. The death toll had already exceeded a hundred.
 </p>

 <p>
  No matter how much training has been stacked, you can’t fight properly without relying on your senses. Moreover, the reliance on vision is absolute.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Damn this pattern.’

 <p>
  After sealing the hero’s skills and engravings, now it takes away the senses. Furthermore, we have to protect the Goddess Statue from the monsters swarming in while fighting the boss in this state.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But…….’
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s still a way to clear it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I got it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha, who was lying down, suddenly stood up. Katiio had inscribed my words on her skin with magic. The same went for Velkist.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Graaaa!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha roared and charged into the crowd of soldiers on all fours. As she swung her claws, the soldiers’ flesh and blood splattered.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Even without vision.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha had a highly developed sense of smell. She could accurately pinpoint the enemies’ locations and slaughter them with her claws. Although it was impossible for her to fight the King of Beasts without her sight, she could easily handle the lesser foes.
 </p>
 <p>
  I stood shoulder to shoulder with Jenna. “We have to hold out until the squad change is complete.”
 </p>

 <p>
  To fight the King of Beasts effectively, Kishasha was essential. We needed to endure until her sight was restored.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood. That much is easy!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna twirled her daggers. And again, the King of Beasts charged. “Don’t clash with his punches! Focus on evasion!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna performed a nimble somersault. Below her, the King of Beasts’ fists swished past one after another. I crouched low and waited for an opening. I relaxed my left arm and focused on keeping him at bay.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re adapting quickly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kiardni smirked. And then.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Right Eye of the Earth Devourer’]
 </p>
 <p>
  The orange eye swept through the arena again. In that instant, my vision blacked out.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This time it’s me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In the darkness, I could see nothing. I quickly assessed my senses as I moved backward.
 </p>

  ‘I lost sight and taste.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Not bad. As I felt around behind me, the smooth surface of the Goddess Statue came into contact.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s my turn now!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Switching roles. Velkist and Kishasha, who could see, stepped forward. Velkist could replace my role, so it was a good combination.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can’t see either.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You can still shoot, can’t you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I could hear their footsteps. Additionally,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can smell it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A unique and intense scent that couldn’t be described. I soon realized it was a scent created by Katiio’s magic. Katiio had created a scent where the enemies were. With such a strong smell, even someone without Kishasha’s sense of smell could easily determine the enemies’ positions.

 <p>
  “I can cover the right side.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio whispered. Even without being told, he found a suitable countermeasure.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled and lowered my sword. The source of the scent was right in front of me. I heard the sound of metal boots on sand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ping! Ping! Ping!
 </p>
 <p>
  The sound of arrows piercing the air. “Ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The screams followed. I pointed my sword forward. Thump! A heavy sound. I stepped sideways. A spear grazed past. I turned and slashed broadly, feeling the dull sensation of cutting through flesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Smell and sound.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I opened my eyes. Still darkness.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come at me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Graaaa!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The soldiers and knights roared.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I understand everything.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I focused on the sounds around me. This was the sound of a spear thrusting. This was the sound of an axe swinging down.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Holy Power of the Goddess Statue increases to 42%!]

 </p>
 <p>
  Slowly, in the darkness, the trajectories of the weapons became clearer.

  “‘Party 4’ has entered the Weekly Dungeon, Candleroot Forest (Lowest Level). They will collect materials and return!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tips: The type of dungeon changes depending on the date. Please make sure to check!]

  “Where are the enemies? Is there a special mission like on the 5th floor?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna surveyed her surroundings with a piercing gaze.
 </p>
 <p>
  I playfully pinched Jenna’s cheek.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Moo-ha-ha-ha!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why are you laughing like this? What’s so funny?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s funny because you’re scared!” I laughed again, “This place is called the Weekly Dungeon, a location specifically designed for gathering materials.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I surveyed my surroundings.
 </p>
 <p>
  Behind me, there was an enigmatic shimmering circle with a radius of approximately 3 meters. It flickered with an otherworldly glow, distorting the space around it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What… what is this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Curiosity got the better of me, and I picked up a small pebble, hurling it into the mysterious space.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han(★)’ collects ‘Trash(F)’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tips/Trash is unnecessary. Please discard it.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, I decided to break off a substantial branch from a nearby tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swiftly, I flung the severed branch into the air.
 </p>

  [Tips/By collecting 100 Branch items, you can process them into lumber. However, you will need a woodworking station.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What? Then can you explain it to me as well?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Throw the gathered materials into that space. Things like branches. They will accumulate in the storage, and you can use them to craft items.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With that in mind, I snapped off another branch and tossed it.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han(★)’ collects ‘Branch’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that all there is to it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I nodded in confirmation.
 </p>
 <p>
  The three of them, both bewildered and intrigued, began to break branches from nearby trees and toss them into the dimensional portal. Soon enough, system messages appeared before us.
 </p>
 <p>
  In reality, for efficient farming in this place, we would require tools such as axes or saws. Breaking branches a hundred times wouldn’t even compare to a single log. However, since Anytng hadn’t provided us with any tools, we had no other choice.

  “Is that really enough? We won’t have to fight?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, it feels different. We just have to follow along.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmph, we hit the jackpot for once.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The three of them let out relieved sighs, appearing somewhat reassured.
 </p>
 <p>
  Engaging in labor like this, gathering branches and tossing them into the portal, was much preferable to fighting monsters and being splattered with blood. Leaving the trio behind, we ventured further into the heart of the forest.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where are we going?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hunting.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hunting? What kind? Wild boar? Deer? Rabbit? Are we finally going to have meat to eat?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not that kind of hunting…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Look!”

 <p>
  Jenna’s eyes glimmered with excitement, and suddenly, she started running.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait for me, meat!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna sprinted through the gaps between trees, pushing through the dense foliage. In her right hand, a bow materialized, an arrow already nocked.
 </p>
 <p>
  I followed closely behind Jenna, determined not to lose sight of her.
 </p>
 <p>
  She effortlessly leaped over tangled vines and surged through the grassy undergrowth, moving swiftly towards her target. However, I managed to keep pace.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the distance, near the majestic Adrim Tree, a deer peacefully grazed on the grass.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the deer relished its delectable feast, it suddenly caught sight of Jenna and startled, bounding away. Yet, in the blink of an eye, Jenna’s arrow found its mark, piercing the deer’s leg.
 </p>
 <p>
  With agile grace, Jenna executed a triangled leap over interwoven branches. Seizing the opportunity, I swiftly cleaved a branch with my sword and pursued her. The injured deer was not far ahead, limping along.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sorry!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna’s face bore no trace of remorse as she lodged an arrow into the deer’s neck.

 <p>
  The deer let out a mournful cry before collapsing onto the grassy forest floor. Surveying the fallen prey, Jenna’s satisfaction was evident.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s going to be delicious.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t you think so too, oppa? The tender texture, the succulent juices! Once grilled, it will make for a delightful feast!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “‘Well, I suppose.'”
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite Chloe’s culinary skills, potatoes alone couldn’t steal the spotlight.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you know how to butcher?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course. I’ve been doing it for years.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna unholstered her dagger from her belt. As she pressed the blade against the deer’s carotid artery, blood flowed steadily.
 </p>
 <p>
  “After draining the blood like this, we remove the hide and organs. Then we cut it into bite-sized pieces for a delectable meal.”

  “Make sure to separate the ingredients and store them in the dimensional portal. Don’t forget anything.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where are you off to?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “For some business.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then I’m coming too!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You can go hunting. I’m also tired of only eating potatoes. You’re originally a hunter so you already know what you should do, you should be fine. If it’s too challenging for you to carry the ingredients alone, call those people. Trust me, it’ll be a hundred times, no, a thousand times better than collecting branches.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Though it was a bit bothersome, I decided to hunt alone.
 </p>
 <p>
  Leaving Jenna, who deftly skinned the deer, behind, I ventured deeper into the forest. A rabbit perked up and twitched its ears upon seeing me, but I paid it no mind and continued my journey.
 </p>
 <p>
  What I sought was the “Queen of the Forest.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a rare monster that appeared in the forest’s weekly dungeon.

  The inferior elemental stone it possessed could be used as an upgrade material. It didn’t always appear, but I had a rough idea of its spawning location. If I proceeded towards the forest’s center, there should be a ravine.
 </p>
 <p>
  And fortunately, I found the ravine.
 </p>
 <p>
  Drawing my sword and shield, I surveyed the surroundings before slowly making my way upstream along the ravine. Rabbits and wild boars quenched their thirst by the water, but I ignored them. The forest grew denser and darker as I advanced upstream.
 </p>
 <p>
  I checked the remaining time displayed in my field of vision.
 </p>
 <p>
  [32:45]
 </p>
 <p>
  Approximately 30 minutes remained. Once that time elapsed, I would automatically be transported back.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had to capture it. Besides the elemental stone in this place, I needed two more materials from other weekly dungeons.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I found it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The creature resided in a small pond within the ravine.
 </p>
 <p>
  Its appearance resembled a deer, but a large horn adorned its forehead. Its massive physique could be mistaken for that of a rhinoceros. A horned doe. Two smaller bucks stood by its side, forming a protective barrier.

  [Forest Queen Lv.10]
 </p>
 <p>
  Level 10.
 </p>
 <p>
  Silently counting, I concealed myself behind a tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  Three.
 </p>
 <p>
  Two.
 </p>
 <p>
  One!
 </p>
 <p>
  I burst out from my hiding spot and charged forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the bucks, leisurely drinking water, met my gaze.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The deer writhed in agony as I swiftly slashed its throat. The other buck turned its horns towards me. With my shield, I deflected the horns and drove my sword into its neck.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a blink of an eye, I dispatched both deer and wiped the blood off the sword’s tip.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your boyfriends are all dead. Does that dampen your spirits?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Snort.
 </p>
 <p>
  The deer responded with a silent exhale.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come at me.”

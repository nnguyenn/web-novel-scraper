 <p>
  Gradually, a radiant light began to wrap around us.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh, it’s already over?” Jenna blinked in surprise.
 </p>

 <p>
  We were slowly fading away into the light.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not over yet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I sprinted along the path.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before returning to the plaza, there was something we needed to learn.
 </p>
 <p>
  The reason this mission was called exploration.
 </p>
 <p>
  “To gather information.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Because we would receive a hint about the next stage.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since the introduction of exploration, it was clear it wouldn’t be a single mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although randomized, it didn’t mean everything was unpredictable.
 </p>
 <p>
  Building upon previous missions and the setting, we could indirectly anticipate the field and task that would unfold.
 </p>
 <p>
  For beginners, exploration seemed like an easily granted mission, but for skilled players, it held a different meaning.
 </p>
 <p>
  I ran at full speed, meticulously surveying the surroundings.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gradually, my form became faint. I had to grasp as many hints as possible within that luminous realm.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how much I ran, there were no obstacles ahead.
 </p>
 <p>
  Through the gaps between trees that sporadically rose on both sides of the road, a particular scene caught my eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a shabby stockade, about 5 meters tall, with ramshackle huts huddled together within the gaps. Dozens of goblins roamed near the huts.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a goblin stronghold.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the village Jenna had seen.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  I disregarded it and kept running. It didn’t take long for the second goblin stronghold to appear.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this a massive goblin habitat?”
 </p>
 <p>
  In this village, goblins were accompanied by wolves.
 </p>
 <p>
  When a goblin rode on one of those wolves, it became a goblin rider. Among the goblin series, they proved to be quite formidable with their distinctive mobility.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kee!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Just then, my eyes met with a goblin.
 </p>
 <p>
  The goblin dashed toward me with determination, but collided with an invisible barrier and tumbled to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t reach there either, and the goblin couldn’t come to this place.
 </p>
 <p>
  Currently, that stronghold was nothing more than an inaccessible backdrop, but it wouldn’t be the case in the next mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  I continued running along the path.

 <p>
  Soon, the dense forest gave way to an open plain.
 </p>
 <p>
  The landscape stretched out before me, revealing a clear view. The entire forest seemed to be transformed into a goblin stronghold.
 </p>
 <p>
  It felt more like a forward operating base than a typical stronghold. The goblins were bustling with activity, crafting weapons, donning armor, and taming wolves.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dozens of goblins clung to the edges of the map, their presence clearly visible.
 </p>
 <p>
  They let out strange, menacing cries, but I paid them little heed. I had seen enough.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a mere moment before my body completely vanished from sight.
 </p>
 <p>
  I increased my speed, pushing myself even further.
 </p>
 <p>
  As I raced at full throttle, I soon caught sight of a city standing in the distance.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then, I returned through the rift of space and time.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why did you rush ahead on your own earlier?”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Just wanted to take a quick look outside.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I had gathered sufficient information.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, it was time to use what I had just witnessed as a foundation to anticipate the theme of the upcoming linked quests and strategize accordingly.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s what they call estimating the “clearance projection.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In the case of these sudden, special dungeons, there was no choice but to send a scouting party to test the waters. However, in the main dungeons, there were often hints to be found.
 </p>
 <p>
  This flow of linked quests that began with exploration was known as a “stream.”
  <br/>
  (T/N: Stream: A series of linked missions.)
 </p>
 <p>
  Analyzing the stream was also a skill of the master.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How frustrating.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I wasn’t sure if what I had seen had been effectively conveyed to Anytng.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if he understood, at this point, when both resources and heroes were short, there wasn’t much that could be done.

 <p>
  I had thought the stream would come at a later time, but it arrived sooner than expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  As I emerged into the plaza, Chloe came rushing towards me in a panic.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was an inexplicably uneasy look on her face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Han, something terrible happened!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Chloe seldom left the plaza as she was often occupied with preparing meals for a group of ten or more.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her large brown eyes were filled with worry.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What happened, Chloe?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “W-well… some strange people showed up…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So what? Is this the first time you encounter strangers?”
 </p>

 <p>
  It seemed that while we were on the mission, Anytng had summoned someone.
 </p>
 <p>
  Apart from the 10-consecutive summon we had done before, Anytng occasionally brought along one or two 1-star heroes.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, it’s not the right time to summon heroes when the mission is still ongoing.
 </p>
 <p>
  I furrowed my brow in concern.
 </p>
 <p>
  Getting distracted during a main dungeon run was a bad habit, to say the least.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They seem different somehow. They’re armed and their vibe feels off,” Chloe voiced her worries.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Iselle!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [What’s the matter?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Show me the system logs from when I was away.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Okay, hold on!]

  Soon enough, the system message appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was displaying past events.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had ordered the woodworking station to process branches and sent a sub-party of three to the second floor. And then…
 </p>
 <p>
  I read through the logs carefully, taking my time.

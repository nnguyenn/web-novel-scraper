  It turned out they were even later than expected, much to everyone’s surprise.

  If it were up to me, I would have recruited them for the party before tackling the climb to the 5th floor. That way, we could have bonded right from the start.

  However, based on the messages we received, all five of them are 3-star characters, which is promising.

  This concept of “bond” is quite rare and special.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  A bond acts like a set, granting a combat power bonus when members are assembled in the same party. It’s a rather uncommon occurrence, even in consecutive summons.

  As we entered the lobby, there stood a woman we hadn’t seen before.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hello there!”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna cheerfully approached the woman and called out to her.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Startled, the woman, who had been gazing at the fireplace, hesitated before responding.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Um, hello….”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m Jenna Shirai! What’s your name, Unni?” (Note: “Unni” is a term used by a female to address an older sister or a respectful senior female)
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m Edis Callen.”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nice to meet you!”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna reached out her hand.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis hesitated for a moment but eventually shook Jenna’s hand.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “And this handsome Oppa here is Han. He may come across as tough, but deep down, he’s a warm-hearted guy.”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stop making a fuss.”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  I casually plopped down on the sofa in the lobby.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, Edis, right? I’d like to have a chat with you. Do you have some time?”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  As I spoke, my gaze fell upon Edis, meticulously examining her features.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  She possessed captivating brown eyes and long, luscious curls that cascaded down her back.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Dressed in a sleek, ebony leather armor, she adorned her belt with two gleaming daggers and a compact short bow.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  I invoked the “Status Window” to gain insight into her abilities and background.

 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  True to her 3-star rating, she emerged with a formidable profession: a Thief.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  With a characteristic blend of agility, her strength and stamina were relatively modest.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Among her repertoire of skills were Novice Dagger Mastery, Archery, and Swift Reflexes.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  While akin to Jenna, her focus seemed to be more attuned to the art of dagger-wielding rather than archery.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna returned with two cups of water, gracefully extending one towards Edis.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “For now, have a seat,” she kindly suggested.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Without a word, Edis settled onto the opposite sofa, her eyes glistening with curiosity as she took a sip.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, inquisitively, she ventured forth with her inquiries.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you have any knowledge about this place?”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “I possess fragments of information, but mysteries still shroud certain aspects,” I replied.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Curious about her own understanding, I further inquired, “What about you? How much do you know? Can you recall how you arrived here?”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  She mused pensively, her eyes narrowing as if attempting to retrieve elusive memories. Gradually, she began to speak.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m unaware of the exact circumstances… I merely sense an unspoken calling to fight,” she confessed.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “A summoning for the sake of combat,” I mused.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, it feels as though there’s an innate necessity to fulfill,” she responded.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Curiosity piqued, I probed deeper, “Do you happen to know the underlying reason behind this compulsion?”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Whenever I strain to recollect, an intense headache ensues, hindering my attempts,” she revealed.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  A heavy sigh escaped my lips as I contemplated the implications.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you acquainted with the concept of synthesis?” I inquired.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Synthesis…” Edis echoed, her brows furrowing in contemplation.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “It refers to gaining strength through the sacrifice of others,” she replied, her voice tinged with a blend of recognition and uncertainty.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Indeed, you’re familiar with it,” I acknowledged.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Continuing my line of questioning, I sought to gauge her knowledge of the master’s existence.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  After a prolonged period of introspection, Edis posed a query, wondering if they held dominion over this realm. While she seemed to grasp the concept, the intricacies of summoning and its associated mechanics remained somewhat elusive to her.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  As I pondered our conversation, a cascade of memories flooded my mind, retracing the impressions left by the individuals summoned from the very first Shay to the present-day Edis.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna, Aaron, and the other 1-star individuals arrived here without any knowledge of why they were summoned or what they needed to do. As for the 4-star Shay, it seemed she had a sense of why she had to fight.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  And in front of me, Edis, while unsure of why she was summoned, knew exactly what she had to accomplish. She had a grasp of the concept of Masters and even understood synthesis.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “The information gap varies based on the summoned rank,” I concluded briefly.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Before coming here, I suppose you were a mercenary?” I asked.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “I belonged to the Fangwolf Mercenary Corps,” she responded.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Fangwolf? That name has a certain charm,” Jenna commented, sitting beside me with a playful grin.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “I vaguely remember working as a mercenary in Halsea, but when I regained my senses, I was here,” Edis began explaining in great detail how the Fangwolf Mercenary Corps was formed and what tasks they primarily undertook.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  From what I gathered, they seemed to be a rather high-ranking group within the mercenaries. There appeared to be a significant difference between them and Molmont, who was also a mercenary but only a 2-star.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s impressive! It sounds like something out of a legend,” Jenna exclaimed.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh, really?” Edis blushed and discreetly cleared her throat before unexpectedly heaving a deep sigh.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “However, at the moment…”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “At the moment?” I prompted.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s nothing.”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, if it’s nothing, then don’t say anything.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why is your reaction like that, Oppa? Stories of a lady’s past are treasures one can’t obtain even with a fortune,” Jenna teased.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you say so.”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re truly dense,” she remarked.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  I rose from the sofa.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  I thought there would be more to hear, but apparently not.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  At least, I get to hear her story of how they were summoned.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  I thought perhaps I could gain some knowledge about the person who imprisoned us in this place if I hear her story.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “I need some rest. You can help yourself, this is your home now.”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come on, just us girls…” Jenna was about to say when,
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  [Avant, Zacken, Weyf, Veigin, Edis!]
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle’s voice echoed through the plaza.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  I halted my steps as I was about to head to the dormitory.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “I still can’t sleep yet.”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  As one of the first advanced heroes obtained since the tutorial, it seemed Master wanted to give them a test run.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  At the entrance of the dining hall, someone unexpected appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who’s there? Who’s calling my name?”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  The man towered over me, standing a head taller with broad shoulders.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Clad in a leather armor similar to Edis, he carried a massive axe on his back.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  As I examined the Status Window, a familiar name surfaced in my mind—Zacken. He was a warrior class, specializing in strength and stamina.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Just by his appearance, one could tell.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems the Master is summoning us,” Edis remarked, rising from the sofa.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s been a while since I had meat. I wouldn’t mind catching a glimpse of that noble face!” Zacken exclaimed.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Zacken and Edis left for the plaza together, with a roasted deer hind leg in hand.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  They didn’t spare a glance for Jenna and me.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “But we’re supposed to share it together!” Chloe rushed out from the dining hall.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  I asked Chloe, “What happened?”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “He said he wanted the meat and walked off with a whole leg. With proper cooking, it could feed all five of us…”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then let’s ask him to give it back!” Jenna clenched her fist and stood up.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait a moment.”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why?”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s go to the plaza first.”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  We stepped out into the plaza.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  A rare sight unfolded before us.

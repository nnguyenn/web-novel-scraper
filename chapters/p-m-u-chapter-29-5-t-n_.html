  Hello everyone, this is Hyung_Otaku, the translator of Pick Me Up!
 </p>
 <p>
  This is not a chapter, Iâ€™m just updating you about the translation process and Patreon and a few other things, so if you donâ€™t feel like reading it you can just skip this one ðŸ™‚

  Iâ€™ve noticed a number of inquiries on my Discord account regarding my Patreon. To those whoâ€™ve been deeply engrossed in â€˜Pick Me Up!â€™, and are eager for more chapters, hereâ€™s some exciting news for you. By subscribing to my Patreon, you will gain early access to one chapter ahead of the free releases on our website. This can be a great way to quench your curiosity a bit sooner!
 </p>
 <p>
  Thatâ€™s not all though. As a subscriber, youâ€™ll also receive exclusive content from other novels I am working on. This includes four chapters from â€˜The 100th Regression of the Max-Level Playerâ€™ and three chapters from â€˜A Frontline Soldier Awakened as a Gamer In The War!â€™ to enrich your reading experience further.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, you might wonder why thereâ€™s only one early access chapter for â€˜Pick Me Up!â€™ on Patreon. The reason is simple and straightforward. Currently, Iâ€™m simultaneously working on three different novels, with â€˜Pick Me Up!â€™ being the most recent one. Plus, Iâ€™m trying to catch up with the Manhwa, which is proving to be a bit time-intensive (You know how life works). As such, until I manage to get things in sync, filling up the tiers on Patreon with additional chapters may take a while.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, even during this period, your support would mean the world to me. Not only will it facilitate the working process, but it also ensures that you receive the content you love as early as possible. So, if you enjoy my work and wish to support me, I would genuinely appreciate your subscription. Thank you!

  I delivered a swift kick to the hilt of the sword embedded in Avant’s back with my foot, causing him to grimace in pain.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Krrrrrrgh, krrrrrrrgh!”

  I firmly grasped the sword’s handle and gave it a sharp twist, accompanied by the sickening sound of flesh tearing apart. Avant could only let out a strained whimper.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, were you willing to leave those people be? It seemed like you were practically drooling to devour them.”

 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “That may have been the case in the past. But now, we’re just…”

 </p>
 <p>

  Avant groped the ground with his right arm, his sword lying within reach. With a sense of malice, I pressed my foot firmly onto the back of his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Grrrr, ugh! You, you’ll regret this… krrrrrrgh!”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>

  I seized the sword embedded in Avant’s back and twisted it mercilessly.

  Iselle stood firmly in their path.

  Zacken swung his axe toward Iselle’s forehead.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>

 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  The other two thrust their spears and swords from the sides.

 <p>
  [I’ve got you,] Iselle smirked slyly.

  The lifeless bodies of three severed heads sprawled in the square. Iselle, with an emotionless gaze, wiped the blood off her hands. Then, with a glimmer in her eyes, she soared towards me.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  [Loki, how did I do? Wasn’t it impressive? Did I perform well? What do you think?]

  Iselle spun around once on the spot and vanished.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned my attention to Avant. With vacant eyes, he gazed upon the lifeless bodies of his comrades and murmured.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hang… I surrender…”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Avant’s head slumped down.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>

 <p>
  [‘Han (★)’ has been released from the berserk state.]
 </p>

  I gently dragged the limp Avant to the synthesis chamber. He offered no resistance.

 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★)’ emerges victorious in the duel against ‘Avant (★★★)’! Avant will be synthesized.]
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Various notifications flashed across the Master’s control panel, capturing their attention.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  He absentmindedly tapped the screen repeatedly seemingly angry.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “He probably wants to cancel the synthesis.”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  If that were the case, permission shouldn’t have been granted in the first place. It seemed he was unaware of the existence of the dueling system.

 <p>
  Stepping out into the square, I couldn’t help but smile.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  He hadn’t even had the chance to fully utilize the advanced heroes he had initially acquired before losing them. Judging by the fact that he had used a free 10-pull solely for synthesis, his expectations had been quite high.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  But things didn’t turn out as anticipated.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Regardless, it would only lead to losses if he invested in them. Even if there was a temporary surge in power, the disruptions caused by such individuals would hinder the smooth functioning of the waiting room. He would appreciate what I did once they discovered the reality.
 </p>

  “He knows I’m the core.”

  The lifeless bodies in the square gradually transformed into radiant light, dissolving into nothingness.

  Edis observed the scene with a bewildered expression on her face.

  “No, but still, I was part of their downfall…”

 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  It hardly mattered.
 </p>
 <p>

  It was all in the past. My own life had never been ideal.

  The hour was late. As soon as I opened the door, the collective gaze of dozens of individuals in the lobby immediately fixated on me. A considerable crowd had gathered.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that what happened?”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Indeed, hyung, you’re awesome!”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Dica clenched his fists tightly, his eyes glistening with admiration.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Haah, she just can’t keep her mouth shut.’
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  I approached Jenna, who was perched somewhat awkwardly on the couch.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  And without hesitation, I gave her a firm tap on her forehead.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ow, ow, ow, what are you doing?”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Didn’t I tell you not to utter unnecessary words?”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “I-I was just trying to share your awesomeness.”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Save it.”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  I firmly gripped Jenna’s forehead.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  She winced, clutching her forehead with a reddened face.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Amidst the commotion, a middle-aged man approached us.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  It was Jeffery, the one who had overheard our conversation earlier.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Han, I heard the conversation. Thank you. I heard about their misdeeds. They were trying to kill the newcomers, threatening them with a knife…”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right! They were truly despicable!”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  A middle-aged woman who had been sitting in the corner of the lobby chimed in. She was one of the people who had narrowly escaped death in the square just moments ago.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “You seem to be mistaken.”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m aware. We’re not so shameless. Nevertheless, I still want to express my gratitude. We owe our lives to you.”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “The ones I saved were just the newcomers. As for you guys, you’re finished.”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “W-What are you saying?”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  I smirked and replied.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems like the Master is really furious.”
 </p>

 <p>
  That evening marked the commencement of the elimination process for the new recruits.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Master made no distinctions between those aspiring to be in the support organization or any other role. Aaron volunteered to participate but was not accepted. Two individuals met their demise, and two more were added through synthesis. Asher became the subject of the synthesis, reaching Level 3.

 <p>
  Meanwhile, the others entered the Weekday Dungeon as if it were just another part of their daily routine.
 </p>
 <p>
  The mine that granted access to Fire Attribute Stones had not yet been opened.
 </p>
 <p>
  And once again, the break of dawn arrived.
 </p>
 <p>
  In response to my summons, six individuals gathered at the training grounds. It was me, Jenna, Aaron, Dica, Edis, and even Asher. Despite Asher and Dica being slightly less skilled, they were immediately prepared to be deployed into the dungeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why did you have to summon us at dawn? I’m so exhausted.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Enough with the complaints.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ignoring Jenna’s grumbling, I proceeded with my words.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do any of you know why I called you here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Silence engulfed the group.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, unexpectedly, Dica raised his hand and spoke up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you deciding on the party members?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t it the Master’s role to determine the party?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can make suggestions.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps Anytng wouldn’t reject the proposal.
 </p>
 <p>
  There is a principle that numerous people, including myself, highlight in the Pick Me Up strategy guides. It is also a focal point in the guide I wrote.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a sad expression, Dica lowered his head. A party consists of five members. He seemed to believe that he would be eliminated from the party, just like during the trio selection.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Relax. I’m not going to discard anyone.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “So…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “From now on, we will be divided into two parties. With six members, splitting into groups of three should work for now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If a single party can conquer all the floors, this game wouldn’t have been so hard.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, this game doesn’t operate in that manner. As we progress through floors, the missions require an increasing number of parties. Special missions can involve anywhere from dozens to hundreds of participants.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, training a backup party is essential to prepare for the unfortunate event of the main party facing an unexpected catastrophe.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There will be two leaders. One will be me, and the other will be Edis.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis blinked and pointed to herself.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t want to?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not that, but I think Jenna would be…”

 <p>
  “She’s not an option.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s wrong with me? I can excel too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Misunderstandings are bound to happen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis posed a question.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But why do we need to split into parties?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Elaborating on that matter here might not be ideal. There are many listening ears.
 </p>
 <p>
  I summoned Edis to the plaza and proceeded to explain.
 </p>
 <p>
  The primary reason for dividing the parties is to minimize the risk of complete annihilation.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you invest all your resources in the main party and it fails, there’s no way to recover. That’s why Masters usually distribute their forces, like diversifying stocks.
 </p>
 <p>
  The second reason is to increase efficiency in training by promoting competition among multiple parties.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
  <script async="" crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4984013611805253">

  <script>
   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  While these reasons may make sense from the Master’s perspective, if you’re a hero and you’re going to lead a party, you need to understand them. I explained this to Edis, taking the time to go into detail about concepts like levels and skills.
 </p>
 <p>
  The final reason for dividing parties is as I mentioned before; five members alone can’t conquer all the floors.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If one party becomes too powerful, it becomes difficult.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Floor 5 was a perfect example of this.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was a significant gap in skill levels among the party members, and when Jid and Hans fell behind, the whole party was in jeopardy.
 </p>
 <p>
  This principle also applies to large-scale missions.
 </p>
 <p>
  When missions are divided among different parties, if one party fails to fulfill its role, it can affect the other parties too. That’s why it was crucial to have a well-prepared sub-party that wouldn’t hinder progress.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do we have enough members to do this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Master will handle the recruitment.”
 </p>

 <p>
  After sending Edis back to the training grounds, I brought an item I had prepared in my room. It was a round container with long strips of paper inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  Placing it on the floor of the training grounds, I explained.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a lucky draw.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A lucky draw? Why?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Have I ever done anything harmful to you? Just go with it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the container were four strips of paper, each colored red or blue at the tip with a pen.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Red is me. Blue is for Edis.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are we dividing into teams with this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t be too thrilled about being on my side, and don’t be disappointed about being on Edis’ side. It doesn’t really matter in the end.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When a powerful sub-party is formed, the Master never underestimates them. They become as important as the main party, if not more.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-6" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
  <script async="" crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4984013611805253">

 </div>
 <p>
  Of course, a failed sub-party is of no use.
 </p>
 <p>
  “In the future when the master summons individuals who can fight, we will also draw lots to decide which party they will join. In such cases, Edis and I will be the ones making the draw.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The process of selecting heroes from the main and sub-parties to become members is known as a “draft” in Pick Me Up terminology. While it was originally used by experienced heroes, it’s something I can implement.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Regardless, the team will be determined by drawing lots!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna wasted no time and promptly drew a slip of paper from the container.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was red.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If it had been blue, I would have overturned it, but this works out well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Next is my turn.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron’s face was filled with tension as he pulled out a slip of paper.
 </p>
 <p>
  Red.

 <p>
  “There’s no need to draw for the rest.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dica and Asher ended up with blue slips. Their expressions turned grim.
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis let out a deep sigh.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I suppose you don’t find me reliable.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s not it. It’s just…” Dica tried to explain.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I understand. There’s no need to say it. I haven’t been here for long, but I will prove my worth.”
 </p>
 <p>
  From an objective standpoint, there is a significant difference in power, but we can’t change the established rules.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s conclude our training for today.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The four of them left the training grounds, while Edis remained seated on the floor, lost in thought. I addressed her.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Edis.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Yes?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you can’t keep up with us, you’ll be left behind.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I understand. I also witnessed the synthesis happening yesterday. Don’t worry, we won’t fall behind.”
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s all I needed to know. I won’t interfere, so it’s up to you to nurture them.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to take care of this now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As I made my way back to the lodging, I murmured to myself.
 </p>
 <p>
  “1st party: Me, Jenna, Aaron. 2nd party: Edis, Asher, Dica.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hero ‘Han (★)’ proposes a fixed party!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘1st Party’ composition]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★)’, ‘Jenna (★)’, ‘Aaron (★)’]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘2nd Party’ composition]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Edis (★★★)’, ‘Asher (★★)’, ‘Dica (★)’]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tips/Sometimes heroes make suggestions like this. It’s up to the Master to accept or reject them. Make wise decisions!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Closing the door behind me, I entered the room. The message I had just sent would be displayed when the Master logged in.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ultimately, the proposal was accepted.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had wondered if they would harbor resentment and refuse, but it seems that wasn’t the case.

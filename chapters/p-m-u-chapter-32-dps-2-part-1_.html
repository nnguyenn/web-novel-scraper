 <p>
  “Are you going to let go of my hand?” I asked, my grip on the lot firm and determined. Edis, too, reached out and clasped my hand, showing her unwavering resolve. Our hands intertwined, crossing paths in the middle.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, I turned my gaze towards the woman and exclaimed, “You!”

 <p>
  “Are you referring to me?” she blinked, her eyes filled with curiosity.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, you. Are you a magician?” I inquired.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If I may introduce myself… Indeed, I am,” she replied, her palm swelling with a grand display of flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  The entire square was momentarily engulfed in a wave of heat, leaving no doubt in my mind. Only a magician could perform such feats. Without hesitation, I summoned the status window.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Eolka Rivel Strashur (★★★) Lv.1 (Exp 0/10)]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Class: Magician]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Strength: 7/7]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Intelligence: 31/31]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stamina: 8/8]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Agility: 7/7]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Skills: Intermediate Flame Magic (Lv.2)]
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s certain,” I concluded, acknowledging her true identity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having a magician in our party would significantly broaden our tactical options. Edis understood this, which explained why she refused to let go of her.
 </p>
 <p>
  In Pick Me Up, warriors and rogues could be trained and promoted from their initial ranks, but magicians were different. They were rare talents that could only be obtained through paid gacha draws. The chances of acquiring magicians were quite slim.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come on let go. If we add that woman to our party, the balance will be greatly improved,” I proposed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do I appear so easily swayed?” Edis retorted, challenging my suggestion.
 </p>
 <p>
  As we deliberated over the lot, Jenna approached Eolka with sparkling eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “A magician! I’ve never seen one before! I’ve only heard rumors about people like you,” Jenna exclaimed with excitement.
 </p>

 <p>
  “But where are we…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is the waiting room. It’s where summoned individuals like us gather and reside,” Jenna explained.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The waiting room?” Eolka furrowed her brow, gently touching her forehead.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It feels strange. This is the first time I’ve experienced something like this,” Eolka confessed, her expression reflecting a mix of wonder and confusion.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t rush. Take your time to think. We still have plenty of time,” Jenna reassured her.
 </p>
 <p>
  “And what are these two up to?” Eloka said, her curiosity piqued by our interaction.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We… Oh, by the way, did you two sneak a peek at the pouch? That’s cheating. It’s a game of chance,” Jenna scolded, maneuvering herself between us and retrieving the lot pouch. With a quick twist of her body, she turned away from us and vigorously shook the pouch from side to side.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll shuffle them again, but this time don’t won’t look.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you two up to?” Eloka was still puzzled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s simple. We’re determining where you’ll end up.”

 <p>
  “What??”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You seem slower at grasping the situation compared to the gentleman beside you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Being suddenly dragged to a strange place and expected to understand the situation… How absurd!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eolka’s voice rose in discontent. Roderick, with his arms crossed and eyes closed, mumbled under his breath.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Take a moment to think.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eolka squinted her eyes, deep in thought, and then furrowed her brow.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you get it now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It feels unpleasant.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I agree.” Roderick nodded.

 <p>
  Jenna placed the pouch of lots between us, having thoroughly shuffled them.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No cheating this time. Let’s do it fair and square.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright, alright.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No matter who gets picked, there should be no hard feelings.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll go first.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis took a deep breath and drew one from the left side.
 </p>
 <p>
  Red.
 </p>
 <p>
  A smile played on my lips.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t hold a grudge,” I chuckled, while Edis pressed her lips together.
 </p>

 <p>
  Having Roderick wasn’t a bad option either. Edis’s party consisted of two closed-ranged heroes and a thief, lacking a mid-range hero.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, having a magician would be preferable.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nevertheless, the results were in. Eolka joined Party 1, while Roderick joined Party 2.
 </p>
 <p>
  I recalled the feeling I had when I displayed the duel request message.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★)’ requests the inclusion of ‘Eolka (★★★)’ in ‘Party 1.’ Will you accept?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes (Select) / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Eolka (★★★)’ has joined ‘Party 1’!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Roderick (★★★)’ has joined ‘Party 2’ along with ‘Edis (★★★)’…’]
 </p>
 <p>
  The party distribution was complete.
 </p>
 <p>
  Afterward, Master touched the synthesis menu.
 </p>

 <p>
  [Pick up a hero.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As expected, two of the 1-star individuals, eager to learn skills by attaching themselves to a support group, were drawn to Iselle.
 </p>
 <p>
  (T/N: Support Group/ Crafting Group)
 </p>
 <p>
  Among them was the young man who had tearfully sought my advice before, hoping for survival.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mr. Han, Mr. Han! You said we can survive if we work hard, didn’t you? This is too much! It’s too much!”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He couldn’t learn any extra skill.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Silently, I turned my head.
 </p>
 <p>
  After cramming the two men into the synthesis room, Iselle spoke up,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Eolka Rivel Strashur! You’re a magician, right? We needed one, and it’s perfect timing! Head to the synthesis room because there’s an offering for you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “An offering?”
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  [For now, just go in. Unless you want something terrible to happen to you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Taken aback, Eolka entered the synthesis room with a bewildered expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  A moment later.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Synthesis complete!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Yon (★)’ and ‘Jenin (★)’ transform into light and vanish.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Eolka (★★★)’ leveled up!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Next was Roderick’s turn.
 </p>
 <p>
  The wary 1-star individuals, sensing something was off, barricaded themselves in their rooms, locking the doors. However, Iselle tore off the doorknob and emerged, dragging them along.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the end, all four victims turned out to be aspiring members of the support group.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some of them barely managed to acquire skills, evading the synthesis. Whether it was a matter of talent or effort, I couldn’t say for sure.
 </p>

 <p>
  Roderick, stepping out of the synthesis room, murmured with a rigid expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s horrifying…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ahaha. It’s okay. If you work hard, you can survive,” Jenna chuckled nervously.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron and Dica kept their heads lowered.
 </p>
 <p>
  The masters who completed the synthesis proceeded to the next step.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Eolka (★★★)’ added to favorites.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Roderick (★★★)’ added to favorites.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Open, The Rift of Time and Space!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Creak.
 </p>
 <p>
  The front door of the square revealed its interior.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They’re testing the newcomers. It seems like you guys are up first.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Party 2! Enter the Rift of Time and Space. Commence!]
 </p>
 <p>
  As always, Iselle appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis let out a sigh and stood up from the bench, and Dica and Asher followed suit.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sir, You’re coming with us too. You’re the protagonist of this battle, after all.” Edis turned around and said.
 </p>
 <p>
  Roderick’s face stiffened, he drew the spear from his back and then entered the Rift.
 </p>
 <p>
  The door closed.

 <p>
  Well, if I could come up with a plan, I could use Eolka as a decoy and eliminate the enemies.
 </p>
 <p>
  I scanned our surroundings once more.

 <p>
  Though we were currently on a plain, there was a forest not too far away.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s change our location. See the forest over there? Let’s head inside.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But won’t we get blocked by the transparent wall?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll deal with that when the time comes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I dashed forward, thrusting my blade into the foremost goblin rider, forcing them downward. As the wolf beneath them opened its jaws, I swiped its forehead and swiftly sidestepped.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aaaah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eolka, positioned directly in the path of the goblin riders’ charge, ran desperately, her dress billowing behind her. The horde of goblins rushed past her, gradually moving farther away.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the end of their charge, an opening presented itself.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now, run!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna and Aaron sheathed their weapons and swiftly made their way towards the forest.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can you go through??” I shouted
 </p>
 <p>
  “I think I can go through!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As expected, this area formed a linked field, where the forest and plain coexisted side by side.
 </p>
 <p>
  I grabbed Eolka’s trembling hand and led her deeper into the forest.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Once we’re inside, cast your spell immediately. Our entrance where you’re going to aim your magic.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “My hand… it hurts! I need some time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do I need to repeat myself?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No!”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Good.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I tightened my grip on her hand and pulled Eolka further into the forest.
 </p>
 <p>
  The horde of goblin riders, having circled back, now aimed their crossbows at us.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Get inside!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I stepped forward, intercepting the bolts with my shield to protect Eolka. She clutched her right hand, tears streaming down her face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you doing? Get inside!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I pushed Eolka, urging her forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  “To treat me like this…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You can complain after you survive, okay?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Grumbling, Eolka made her way into the forest.

 <p>
  After a moment, a crimson glow ignited from within the depths of the woods.
 </p>
 <p>
  I found myself alone on the vast plain.
 </p>
 <p>
  Due to the limitations of cavalry, they would have a difficult time targeting me effectively within the forest. I silently began to count down from 60.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hyung, come in! It’s dangerous out there!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll be there soon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I took a deep breath, trying to steady myself.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han(★)’ has entered a Frenzy state for the second time today!]
 </p>
 <p>
  A brief dizziness overwhelmed me, but I managed to endure it. I tightened my grip on the sword, readying myself. The goblins, realizing I was alone, circled around me instead of charging head-on, unleashing bolts and swinging their blades.
 </p>
 <p>
  I deflected the bolts with my shield,
 </p>
 <p>
  And parried their attacks with my sword.
 </p>

  “Don’t come out! If you do, they’ll scatter. Once all of them gather up and we’ll go in together.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I warned Aaron, who was attempting to leave the forest.
 </p>
 <p>
  The encircling goblins closed in, their attacks growing fiercer. I crouched down, biding my time.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Approximately 15 seconds remaining.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I filled my lungs with air, gathering strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  Three swords swung simultaneously. I lowered my body, using the momentum to swing my sword in a wide arc. The blades deflected, causing one goblin to spray blood and collapse.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I must clear a path!’
 </p>
 <p>
  I raised my shield, swiftly piercing through the encirclement.
 </p>
 <p>
  From that point onward, there was no need for further contemplation. I sprinted with all my might into the forest. Inside, the crimson glow intensified. The goblins lined up and pursued me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna, who had been concealed near the edge of the forest, called out.

  “Oppa, careful!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay!”
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed that everything was ready.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just before entering the forest, I dropped to the ground, pressing my stomach against the earth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Twenty wolves and goblins dashed right behind me.
 </p>
 <p>
  In that moment,
 </p>
 <p>
  【Ignite!】
 </p>
 <p>
  Like a raging tempest, flames erupted from between the trees, engulfing my field of vision. The flickering inferno consumed the charging goblin riders from the front, leaving no survivors in its wake.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It doesn’t seem like it’s over yet!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I quickly moved out of the range of the flames, assuming a defensive posture.

  A searing sensation ran through my back as if it were scalded.
 </p>
 <p>
  【Raise Up!】
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom! Boom! Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  With a deafening blast, shockwaves swept through the area. The flames that engulfed the horde of goblin riders exploded simultaneously. Charred goblin corpses soared high into the sky, propelled by the force of the explosion.
 </p>
 <p>
  【Sublimate!】
 </p>
 <p>
  A towering pillar of fire shot up from the ground, reaching several meters in height. The fiery column, swirling with powerful currents, spun like a hurricane, scattering burning bodies in every direction.

  [‘Aaron (★)’, ‘Eolka (★★★)’, leveled up!]
 </p>
 <p>
  We returned through the rift in space and time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron muttered with a bewildered voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What in the world just happened…”
 </p>
 <p>
  More than 20 goblin riders were wiped out by a single spell.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That was amazing!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehehe! This is the true power of fire! Didn’t I promise? I said you would be astonished when you witness my magic! I am Eolka Rivel, the Witch of the Rivel Barony…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eolka, who had been laughing confidently, suddenly collapsed to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh, sister?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This woman is something else.”

  During the 1-minute casting, she was unable to do anything, and her party members had to protect her unconditionally. She couldn’t even use support magic, and her strength, stamina, and agility are all below rank 1.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ve summoned and used countless mages before, but this is a rare type. It’s not the first time, but it’s close to being the first.
 </p>
 <p>
  If I were to compare her to a tank, it would be like tearing off the treads and armor plating of an Infinite Tank and transforming it into a form that focuses solely on firepower.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nevertheless, her power alone is worth acknowledging.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It seems like we have a lot of work to do.

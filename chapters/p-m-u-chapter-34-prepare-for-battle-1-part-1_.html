 <p>
  The following day arrived.
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as the master logged in, his first task was to construct a dedicated facility for wizards.

 <p>
  [“Constructing facilities. Please touch the type of facility you desire.”]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have chosen the ‘Magic Research Lab,’ an auxiliary building of the ‘Training Ground.’ Would you like to expand this building?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  A gentle vibration ran through the entire waiting room, accompanied by the appearance of a message.
 </p>
 <p>
  The people in the training ground seemed accustomed to such vibrations and continued with their tasks undisturbed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The ‘Alchemy Lab,’ an extension of the ‘Training Ground’…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The ‘Library,’ an extension of the ‘Training Ground’…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Magic Research Lab has been completed! Research is now available.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Alchemy Lab has been completed! You can now synthesize various items.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Library has been completed! Mages can now hone their knowledge on their own.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Great!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The three auxiliary buildings of the training ground, the Magic Research Lab, Alchemy Lab, and Library, have combined to create a new facility called the ‘Hall of Magic.’]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why am I also doing this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the trainees running along the track, there was a young woman with brown hair—Eolka Rivel Strasheur. She was the hero who had impressively defeated twenty goblin riders the previous day.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eolka couldn’t help but grumble incessantly as she ran.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why do elite individuals like me have to endure such mindless training?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just keep running.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m a talented person who relies on my intellect!”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Then maybe you should just eat potatoes from now on.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Argh, seriously!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eolka gritted her teeth and continued running.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was the task I assigned to her. Her stamina was remarkably low. Even though mages prioritize intelligence, having stamina is crucial on a battlefield where swords and spears clash.
 </p>
 <p>
  She was currently wearing Jenna’s spare dress. Eolka’s original dress was a specially crafted magical item made by her family. It enhanced the power of fire magic. After verifying it, I realized that her statement wasn’t unfounded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why me? Why do I have to go through this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re grumbling too much.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t as if I had ordered a particularly challenging menu.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just three laps around the track per day. She hasn’t had to carry a sandbag. The pace was slow. Compared to what I’m used to doing, it was enough to make me yawn.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eolka’s incessant grumbling prompted me to issue an amusing order to Chloe: “If she doesn’t stop complaining, feed her nothing but potatoes for all three meals.”

 <p>
  As I trailed behind Eolka during her run, I gazed upward, taking in the breathtaking sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sky was an enchanting shade of azure, reminiscent of deep mysteries. It had been quite some time since the master logged in during the morning hours. Anytng seemed captivated, quietly observing the training ground without issuing any commands.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Since I’m incredibly busy, please find something else to occupy yourself with.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I can’t pretend to keep doing training, there were other tasks that demanded my attention at this point.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the tenth floor fast approaching, luck was on our side. We had managed to recruit a magician, and the magnificent Hall of Magic had been unveiled.
 </p>
 <p>
  The warehouse eagerly awaited my touch, filled to the brim with a myriad of materials I had diligently collected. The recent opening of the Isalta Mine allowed us to acquire a diverse range of materials from the three distinct dungeons. The time had come to craft consumable items, including potions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Originally, this was considered high-level content, reserved for skilled apothecaries and alchemists. However, by utilizing the same approach I employed for equipment crafting—relying on engaging mini-games—I could manufacture items even without the required expertise.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, it was crucial to keep such scenes hidden from Anytng’s watchful eyes. If he were to witness the game’s hero creating items through a mini-game, he would undoubtedly trigger a bug report.
 </p>
 <p>
  After a satisfying round of observation, Anytng seemed content and gracefully logged out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Without hesitation, I ceased my running and made my way towards the exit.
 </p>

  “Jenna, please keep a watchful eye on her to prevent any escape attempts.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, of course! Sis, let’s keep running with determination. We can do it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I never expected things to turn out like this…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Stepping out onto the plaza, I called out loudly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Iselle!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Loki’s trusted subordinate, Iselle, makes her grand entrance! What’s happening?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “We have important matters to attend to. We must create valuable items.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ah, I see! I’ll open it up right away!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The warehouse doors swung open slowly, revealing a treasure trove of materials. I swiftly loaded them onto the cart at the entrance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Life Grass, Mana Herb, Crispy Mushroom, Highland Water, Goldstone, Azureite…
 </p>

 <p>
  Although we lacked variety in ore, we managed to make the numbers work. I had relinquished my focus on gathering elemental stones and instead directed my efforts towards collecting resources. As we neared the ascent to the tenth floor, the priority shifted from advancement to item creation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pulling the cart behind me, I returned to the training ground. Eolka, drenched in sweat, gasped for breath, yet her eyes conveyed a sense of eagerness towards me. Ignoring her, I entered through the newly fashioned door on the left side of the training ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hall of Magic Level 1]
 </p>
 <p>
  The room was shrouded in darkness, with bookshelves on either side adorned with books emitting a nostalgic aroma. I randomly plucked one and attempted to read its contents. However, it was filled with cryptic formulas and intricate diagrams that were beyond my comprehension.
 </p>
 <p>
  Guiding the cart forward, I proceeded towards my intended destination—a secluded corner of the Hall, where a room draped in curtains awaited.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Alchemy Cauldron.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As I nudged the cart beside the cauldron, I envisioned the scene of pharmacy concocting potions. Pouring Highland Water into the cauldron, igniting the stove, and setting it to a vigorous boil. Then delicately adding finely ground Life Grass in precise proportions…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Too much hassle.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a flick of my finger, Iselle promptly presented the item synthesis window, as if she had been patiently awaiting my command.
 </p>
 <p>
  From the cart, I retrieved a glass bottle brimming with water—Highland Water. I carelessly flung it into the cauldron, paying no mind to the shattering sound that ensued. Crispy Mushroom, Goldstone, Life Grass—they were all haphazardly tossed in, their ratios and proportions disregarded.
 </p>

 <p>
  The potion creation window materialized before me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ignoring the successive messages warning of potential penalties, I proceeded. The mini-game employed for item crafting and enchantment entailed tapping the keys in sync with the rhythmic beats.
 </p>
 <p>
  [★ Amazing Success! ★]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han(★)’ has successfully crafted a ‘Low-grade Health Potion’!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [★ Amazing Success! ★]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han(★)’ has successfully crafted a ‘Low-grade Health Potion’…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [★ Amazing Success! ★]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han(★)’ has successfully crafted a ‘Low-grade Mana Potion’…]
 </p>
 <p>
  The newly forged items emerged from a recess beneath the cauldron.
 </p>
 <p>
  I transformed all the materials in the cart into consumable items. Admittedly, this might arouse Anytng’s suspicion, but there was no alternative. It was wiser to put them to use rather than let them languish in neglect.

  The fruits of my labor: six Health Potions and two Mana Potions.
 </p>
 <p>
  I returned the potions to the warehouse, knowing they would prove invaluable on the tenth floor.

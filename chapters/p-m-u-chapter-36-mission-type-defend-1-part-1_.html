 <p>
  The following evening arrived, and a gathering took place in the bustling square. Every member from both Party 1 and Party 2 assembled, including Han, Jenna, Aaron, Eolka, and the belated arrival of Shurn. The rest of the group consisted of Edis, Roderick, Dica, Asher, and an unidentified person.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You there.”

 <p>
  “Yes!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A young man with closely cropped hair replied promptly. He appeared to be in his early twenties, towering in height but with a lean physique. A quintessential underdog.
 </p>
 <p>
  “When the battle commences, find a suitable position and hold your ground.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you’re looking for death, feel free to tag along.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ho, however…”
 </p>
 <p>
  He was at level 3, possessing only a fundamental sword skill at level 1. It was evident that his presence would be more of a hindrance than a help.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can fight too!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why do you treat me like this, pushing me around? We’re comrades, aren’t we?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m not pushing you around.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He joined the party at a rather late stage.
 </p>
 <p>
  Had we been given just a week, we could have managed to assign him a specific role. Mere numbers filling would not suffice. It was a matter of whether he could carry his own weight within the party. Otherwise, he would become nothing more than a lackluster presence.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But seriously, what are we doing here? The little fairy didn’t summon us, did she?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “She will summon us soon, so don’t doubt it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “And you again! Acting as if you have all the answers.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I raised my gaze to the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  It gleamed brilliantly, the Ankana connection established thirty minutes ago, silently observing the waiting room without issuing any commands.

 <p>
  “He’s contemplating.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Should we challenge the 10th floor, or should we allow ourselves a little more time?
 </p>
 <p>
  Certain aspects remained incomplete. The newest member had yet to adapt to the party dynamics, and despite my level being 10, the pinnacle of a 1-star ranking, I had not achieved promotion yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  I hoped my predictions would prove incorrect.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he rush the process, the situation would become complicated. However, if he waits for about a week, I could upgrade my skills to the maximum level achievable for a 1-star rank. It would be wise to conclude one research endeavor before proceeding. That way, we would be better prepared to face the challenges of the 10th floor compared to our current state.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, Anytng’s nature, as observed thus far, suggested otherwise.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the end, whether we perished or were utterly annihilated, it would pose no problem. Nevertheless, for the master, it was merely a game—a realm where heroes could be reselected and nurtured once more.
 </p>
 <p>
  To us, it was reality,
 </p>
 <p>
  But to the master, it was far from it.
 </p>
 <p>
  At long last, the control window of Anytng came to life, initiating movement.

  Iselle materialized, gracefully circling the bustling square.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Oh, everyone is here! This means I don’t have to raise my voice. Party 1!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Here!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Party 2!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re present.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Open the rift of time and space!]
 </p>
 <p>
  With a creaking sound, the grand gate at the forefront of the square swung open wide.
 </p>
 <p>
  A sense of tension emanated from the gazes of the crowd. Though I refrained from making a fuss, whispers had already spread, hinting at the events that had transpired on the 5th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Take a deep breath. Relax. We can do this.”

  Jenna placed a hand on her chest, controlling her breathing.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was all because of this master.
 </p>
 <p>
  [※Attention!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [This mission requires two parties for a medium-sized operation. If your party is lacking members, use paid or free summoning to recruit additional heroes!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tips/By utilizing the auxiliary facility of the spatial rift, known as the ‘Tactical Headquarters,’ you can issue tactical instructions to the heroes participating in the mission.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Tactical Headquarters, huh?’
 </p>
 <p>
  He has no clue how to make proper use of it.
 </p>
 <p>
  For novices, it was a rather intricate system.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But before that, just a moment, Iselle!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes!]

  “Head to the warehouse and fetch the items we prepared.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle nodded and vanished into thin air.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before long, a message appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, there are unused consumables in the warehouse. Please equip them with the heroes. The heroes will use these consumables at the appropriate time.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tips/You can craft consumables at the alchemy lab or the magic hall. Materials can be obtained from the daily dungeons. Consumables, one of the shortcuts to victory! It’s the pathway to becoming a consummate master of pick-me-up!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle emerged from the warehouse, pulling along a cart.
 </p>
 <p>
  The cart contained potions and a variety of items that I had recently crafted.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Give ‘Han(★)’ a ‘Low-grade Health Potion’ to carry!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle tossed a glass bottle filled with a crimson liquid toward me. I caught it and securely fastened it to my belt.
 </p>

 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Give ‘Edis(★★★)’…]
 </p>
 <p>
  There were a total of six health potions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Divided equally, each party would receive three.
 </p>
 <p>
  The mana potion was reserved exclusively for Eolka.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eolka shook the glass bottle containing the fluid that shimmered with a tranquil blue hue.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is quite an expensive item. Where did you get it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t bother asking. It’s better left unsaid.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eolka playfully flicked his tongue and discreetly tucked the mana potion inside her garment.

  She seemed to have found a clever way to store it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Turning to Edis, I inquired, “Are we all prepared?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s all over.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aare these your final words?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you’re kidding, then it’s really a bad joke.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis chuckled and stepped forward, entering the spatial rift.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dica and Asher respectfully nodded to me before following Edis, while Roderick and the remaining individual joined them inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  The spatial rift remained open.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eagerly awaited our entry.

  “Oppa!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s wrong?”

 <p>
  “I think there’s another one!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Jenna’s words faded, the ground trembled beneath us. I smashed another goblin’s head with my shield and retreated. Amidst the pouring rain, a hulking figure emerged.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stay composed. Handle it just as we did the previous one.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But this one seems… different?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Different how?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The new ogre studied the corpse of its companion for a moment before shifting its gaze towards the dam, where a fiery wall blazed brightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “He’s aiming for the dam.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got him!”
 </p>
 <p>
  With another swift motion, Jenna launched an arrow that lodged itself into the ogre’s armpit.
 </p>
 <p>
  In response, the ogre let out a defiant roar and turned to look at Jenna.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Excellent. Now, it’s focused on me…”
 </p>
 <p>
  But then the ogre hunched, launching itself in a sprint towards the dam.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Damn it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  “Block its path!”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a twang, a second arrow struck the ogre’s calf. Undeterred, the creature continued its relentless charge.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Goblins, crowded on its route, were squashed or catapulted into the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Has he lost his mind?” I gasped.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our fiery barricade might hold off the goblins, but it was powerless against the resilient rush of an ogre.

 <p>
  Dropping my shield, I clutched my sword and lunged forward. Yet, my strides seemed painfully slow. I couldn’t get close enough.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aaron, prevent it from reaching the dam!” I cried out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unfazed by the spear skewering his knee, the ogre let out a tormented roar and bulldozed past Aaron.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is it hell-bent on destroying the dam, dead or alive?’
 </p>
 <p>
  An unpredictable threat had joined the fray.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna, quick as a whip, ascended the ogre’s armor-plated back. With her dagger in a reverse grip, she repeatedly plunged it into the creature’s trapezius, where the neck and shoulder converged.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thunk! Thunk! Thunk! Thunk!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Arrrrrggghhhhh!” The ogre roared in pain.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who on earth is that?” Eolka’s voice echoed in disbelief as she opened her eyes after she hastily ended her spellcasting and ran.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ignoring goblins, boulders, and flames alike, the ogre remained fixated on the dam, dashing towards it without any hesitation.
 </p>

 <p>
  ‘I’m too late,’ I realized.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Get off it, Jenna.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In a graceful mid-air somersault, Jenna disengaged from the ogre. It then plowed into the dam, sending out a spiderweb of fractures. With a deafening crack, a gaping hole appeared, and water gushed out uncontrollably.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  The river level began its upward surge.
 </p>
 <p>
  The distant thunder of hooves trampling the ground echoed from the 7th floor, growing louder with each passing second.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kya-ro!”
 </p>
 <p>
  In one swift motion, I plunged my sword into a goblin’s mouth. The blade emerged from the back of its neck, having sliced through its tongue.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the last one. The ogre, its task fulfilled, was swept away by the river’s swift current, vanishing from sight. Kicking the lifeless body of a Goblin at my feet, I muttered, “We’ve failed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So wha……”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Time to head back. We need to come up with a second plan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A second plan, huh?
 </p>
 <p>
  I briefly pondered this prospect.
 </p>
 <p>
  Without any backup, the daunting reality was clear: 370 of us would have to hold back a horde of over 3,000 goblins.
 </p>
 <p>
  I gritted my teeth. A reckless wildcard had thrown our mission into chaos. But surrender wasn’t an option. We had to find a solution, whether one existed or not. Retrieving my shield, I slung it over my shoulder.
 </p>
 <p>
  The horses’ hoofbeats grew louder and more urgent. However, the river, now a threatening force, was swelling at an alarming rate.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This timeline makes no sense,” I wrestled back a sigh, desperate to claw its way up my throat.
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly Eolka broke the silence.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hold on.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What?”
 </p>

 <p>
  【Draste Siradus.】
 </p>
 <p>
  A luminescent blue flash sparked in Eolka’s eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, a riverside rock levitated into the ether.
 </p>
 <p>
  【Move!】
 </p>
 <p>
  Guided by Eolka’s gesture, the rock took flight, sealing the ruptured dam’s breach.
 </p>
 <p>
  Water, once freely flowing through the gaps, halted abruptly. Eolka tossed her soaked hair back, chuckling with self-satisfaction.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, you, how…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Telekinesis? It’s the most basic of magical arts. Surprised, aren’t you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why on earth didn’t you say could do something like this sooner?” I shouted furiously.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why are you angry? I just saved a mission that would have failed without me…?”
 </p>

 <p>
  Staggering, Eolka wavered on the brink of collapse.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron dashed forward, steadying her.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Appreciated. You do have manners, unlike some. I… ahurg!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eolka’s cheek was suddenly in my grasp.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who told you to hide your powers, huh? I was clear, ‘Tell me all the spells you could use’.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You… Ouch! This spell was too basic…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Enough.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As I released her cheek, Eolka shot me a look – a grumpy frown beneath her teary eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anyway, we’re alive thanks to you. Gratitude is due. Everyone, regroup. and take sips from your potions.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Retreating to the tree-shaded spot from earlier, we dusted ourselves down and drank our potions. Eolka, paler than a ghost, looked ready to retch, struggling with her mana potion.

  “I wish this rain would ease.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna wrung out her dress, a cascade of water spilling from its folds.
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly the sound of approaching hooves filled the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  A knight at the forefront waved a crimson flag bearing a lion’s emblem.
 </p>
 <p>
  Trailing him, a cavalry of hundreds thundered out from the forest. Clad in shining plate armor, their sturdy steeds maintained their speed, unperturbed by the mud.
 </p>
 <p>
  “All forces, advance! Demonstrate the valor of the Iron Lion Cavalry!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But Captain, the river…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do I look like I care? Nothing can stop us today! Cross it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, sir! Everyone, charge!”
 </p>
 <p>
  One by one, knights began plunging into the river.

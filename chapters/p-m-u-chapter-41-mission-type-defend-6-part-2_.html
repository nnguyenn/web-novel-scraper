 <p>
  One of the wolves, about to bite the horse’s rump, took an arrow in the head and fell over.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking back, I saw Jenna aiming her bow from far atop the city wall. Every time she pulled the bowstring, a wolf rolled over.

 <p>
  ‘That crazy girl…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  A loud noise followed the collapse of the city gate.
 </p>
 <p>
  The lead ogre began to enter the city. Jenna quickly descended from the city wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I want to split my body into two.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Above all, the priority was defending the goddess statue.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the outer gate collapsed, they had to immediately retreat to the inner city and build barricades inside the gate. If they utilized the experience from the 5th floor, they should be able to hold out for a long time.
 </p>
 <p>
  So I decided to tune out everything else.
 </p>
 <p>
  It didn’t matter how long they could hold on over there.
 </p>
 <p>
  The real issue was how quickly I could deal with the priest.
 </p>
 <p>
  The warhorse trampled and crushed the corpses as we ran toward the forest. Before I knew it, the heat from the burning forest could be felt on my skin. I dismounted from the horse.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hee-heeng!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The horse raised its front hooves and disappeared into the western plains.
 </p>
 <p>
  Behind me was a horde of corpses trying to feast on my flesh, and ahead was the inferno.
 </p>
 <p>
  The fire was burning fiercely as if trying to engulf the entire forest.
 </p>
 <p>
  The trees near the plains were charred black, and behind them, the sound of burning leaves, and branches swayed as they were engulfed in flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  “….”

 <p>
  The corpses of humans and goblins staggered towards me despite the fire being right in front of them.
 </p>
 <p>
  I uncapped a health potion and drank it in one go, then sprinkled the remaining liquid over my head. Then I stepped into the flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kiaa!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as I entered, a goblin corpse tried to hit me. The whole body was burning.
 </p>
 <p>
  I twisted my body to the side, and it fell over, still burning, and stopped moving.
 </p>
 <p>
  I lowered my upper body to avoid inhaling too much smoke. Even so, my steps were quick. The heat was scorching, and the air was scarce.
 </p>
 <p>
  I can endure this much.
 </p>
 <p>
  It didn’t take long before I reached the edge of the map.
 </p>
 <p>
  An impassable transparent wall. The fire continued to spread beyond it, but I couldn’t go any further.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I know you’re here.”

 <p>
  The fact that I couldn’t pass through the wall means the enemy can’t either.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since I didn’t see anyone coming out of the forest, it means they are confined in this small space.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ddara-ran!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Skill Awakening!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★)’ ‘Flame Resistance’ has increased to Lv.2!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Ignoring the skill level-up notification that appeared in my field of view, I unsheathed my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  I just need to kill one person. Just one person.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Maekin (★)’ is panicked! All attributes reduced by 50%.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Shurn (★)’ is terrified! All attributes reduced by 30%.]
 </p>
 <p>
  They were the two who joined mine and Edis’s party at the last moment.

 <p>
  [‘Dica (★)’ is terrified…]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They’re getting close to their limit.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I moved the messages to the corner of my vision.
 </p>
 <p>
  A black shadow moved from the ashes.
 </p>
 <p>
  I grasped my sword tightly and leaped towards it. A crimson arrow shot out from between the burning branches, and I blocked it with my shield.
 </p>
 <p>
  “….!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The projectile pierced through my iron shield as if it were butter and penetrated my left arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though weak in terms of combat power, the priest is still a mid-level monster.

 <p>
  And since we’re in a low-level floor, it’s a bit different.
 </p>
 <p>
  The second magical arrow came flying. This time, it’s aimed at my right chest.
 </p>
 <p>
  I tried to dodge, but there was nowhere to hide. I bit my tongue hard, drawing blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★)’ has entered a frenzied state!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Kikkagagak!
 </p>
 <p>
  The clash of sword and magical arrow resounded. The spinning arrow grazed the sword and took a chunk of flesh from my shoulder before disappearing. I immediately leaped forward and hit the ground. The third arrow grazed above my head.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I didn’t have the projectile defense skill, I would’ve been done for.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The situation isn’t favorable.
 </p>
 <p>
  Regardless of flame resistance and everything else, my surrounding is on fire. Each time I take a breath, acrid smoke mixes with the air and enters my lungs. Blood belatedly started oozing from the hole in my left arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★)’ is bleeding. Health decreases at regular intervals.]

 <p>
  There’s no time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before my mind gets clouded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before the party is wiped out.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yo…u… wan…t… to…. play….”
 </p>
 <p>
  A eerie voice echoed from inside the forest.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Play? Sure, what kind of play?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yo…u…. an…d…. others….”
 </p>
 <p>
  I stood up abruptly and threw my sword in the direction of the voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I drew my second weapon, the dagger, as I kept running.

 <p>
  Kiiiiing!
 </p>
 <p>
  A black arrow flew towards me. I extended my left arm to block it. My left arm was torn off completely and flew away. My vision turned red.
 </p>
 <p>
  I gripped the dagger in reverse and aimed for the hooded figure’s face.
 </p>
 <p>
  The second black arrow pierced through my right chest.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★)’ is in a critical state….]
 </p>
 <p>
  Thunk!
 </p>
 <p>
  The dagger was plunged into the hood.
 </p>
 <p>
  I pulled it out and thrust it in again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Without caring, I kept thrusting.
 </p>
 <p>
  The black priest, who had been writhing and trembling, eventually stopped moving.

  “…Kulk.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Blood spurted from his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is it a stage clear?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I dragged my right arm and leaned against the tree trunk.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is it not over?’
 </p>
 <p>
  If that’s the case, it’s the end.
 </p>
 <p>
  I don’t know anymore.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ll probably die before the statue of the goddess shatters.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Shurn (★)’ has returned to the embrace of the goddess! His spirit will be remembered forever.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Damn it.
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s no hellish death worse than this.
 </p>
 <p>
  To be dragged to an unknown place, suffer like a dog, and then die.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I was about to lose my grip on my sanity, a message popped up.
 </p>
 <p>

 <p>
  [MVP – ‘Han (★)’]

 <p>
  [Congratulations, Master, on clearing the 10th floor!]

  But I didn’t even notice it.

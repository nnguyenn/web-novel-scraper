 <p>
  I opened my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  A gloomy, ashen sky greeted me. As I turned my head, I noticed the familiar bed. It was my room inside the lodging.
 </p>

 <p>
  I rotated my left arm, the part that had been torn off by the Black Priests’ magic.
 </p>
 <p>
  It moved properly. There was no trace of the hole that had been in my right chest too.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I survived.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I had thought I might not make it back, but it seems I was a step ahead.
 </p>
 <p>
  I got up from the bed and checked the clock. It was 3:45 in the morning. Everyone in the waiting room would be asleep by now.
 </p>
 <p>
  I laid back down and closed my eyes, but my mind was sharp.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eventually, I gave up and went to the lobby.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron was sitting on the lobby sofa, bowing his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took a seat next to him and said, “You look horrible.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, Hyung-nim.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron looked up at me. There were dark circles under his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m relieved you’re safe. We were all worried.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Worried, my foot. Anyway, what kind of tremendous struggle were you going through to look so grim?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was thinking about the reason we fight.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The reason we fight?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “After you left, the city was flooded with corpses. And…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron’s expression darkened.
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t need him to say it; I could already guess.
 </p>

 <p>
  Inside the city, numerous civilian NPCs resided.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if they sought refuge within the city walls, there was a limit to how many could be accommodated.
 </p>
 <p>
  The massacre caused by the corpses must have been devastating. Jenna, Aaron, Edis, and they must have witnessed it all vividly.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at Aaron, who was merely sipping water with a frown.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Has his stress level spiked?’
 </p>
 <p>
  If a hero repeatedly engages in combat and training without rest, their stress can accumulate excessively, leading to depression.
 </p>
 <p>
  Alternatively, witnessing large-scale massacres or the death of close comrades during a mission can also trigger depression. Depression was one of the leading causes of sudden death.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron, who had been sipping water for a while, stood up from his seat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll go inside first. Rest well, hyung-nim.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Will you come out with that same expression tomorrow?”
 </p>

 <p>
  Aaron let out a bitter laugh and replied, “I’ll recover by tomorrow.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright, go ahead.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron bowed his head to me and returned to the lodging.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sat alone in the dark lobby and drank my water.
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t help but think of the guy who had brought me here.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even this time it was the same. Due to the mosaic around him, I couldn’t see the bastard’s face properly. Only the unpleasant voice, scratching like metal, remained in my mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did he say he would wait?”
 </p>
 <p>
  If I had the leisure, I would have asked the Black Priest who seemed like he wanted to talk to me, but I killed him.
 </p>
 <p>
  That day, until Chloe appeared in the early morning, I couldn’t fall asleep.
 </p>

 <p>
  I had spent the night wide awake.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now that a major battle was over, I needed to take measures to reduce stress.
 </p>
 <p>
  Originally, it was Anytng’s role, but since that guy couldn’t do his job properly, there’s no other way.
 </p>
 <p>
  I spoke to Chloe, who was preparing ingredients in the kitchen, after giving me a greeting.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Bring out all the ingredients. Cook the best dishes you can.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Chloe hesitated for a moment but soon nodded and brought out all the ingredients from the storage. The new baker who followed Chloe’s lead in the kitchen also began to display her skills.
 </p>
 <p>
  The morning meal is where everyone in the waiting room gathers.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the table were various grand dishes like meat, bread, salad, soup, and more.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna, the first to come out to the dining area, blinked her eyes in surprise.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s all this? It’s so fancy for breakfast.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Why, don’t you like it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No! It’s always welcome if it’s like this!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna smiled and took a seat.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon, the members of the waiting room came out one by one. They were surprised once when they saw the food and twice when they saw me. It was understandable. I rarely appeared in the dining area.
 </p>
 <p>
  The meal began.
 </p>
 <p>
  I grabbed some bread hastily and observed my party members’ faces.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jenna seems fine, as usual. Aaron is doing well too. Eolka looks good.”
 </p>
 <p>
  They didn’t seem to be in good moods.
 </p>
 <p>
  But somehow, they were holding it together.
 </p>
 <p>
  I observed the members of the 2nd party.
 </p>

 <p>
  The two 3-star members seemed fine. Asher was managing somehow.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no need to look for Shurn and Maekin, the 5th members of each party because even though I weren’t there with them I knew they were already dead.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was somewhat expected. Both of them joined late, and their levels were too low.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Dica.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Sigh-
 </p>
 <p>
  Dica was puking.
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis stood up and supported Dica, leading him away.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mental management of the party members was also one of the leader’s roles.
 </p>
 <p>
  The battle was fierce, but there weren’t many casualties.
 </p>
 <p>
  That might be the reason why we’re currently alright.

 <p>
  Even so, it’s definitely not in perfect condition.
 </p>
 <p>
  Stress was accumulating, whether we were aware of it or not.
 </p>
 <p>
  And on that day, in the late evening when everyone returned to the lodging.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Welcome to Pick Me Up!]

  I knew Anytng would come.

  The low-grade fire elemental stones were given as the 10th floor’s clear reward.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the warehouse, I stored the water and wind elemental stones that we had collected from the weekly dungeons.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a cheerful sound, an alert popped up.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, there is a hero waiting for promotion!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Promotable Hero – ‘Han(★)’]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tips/To promote, you need the annex building ‘Promotion Hall’ in the Synthesis Center.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng’s operation window appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Facility tab was touched.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have selected the annex building ‘Promotion Hall’ for the Synthesis Center. Would you like to build it?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes (Select) / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  Kururur.
 </p>
 <p>
  A faint vibration shook the waiting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Promotion Hall has been completed! From now on, hero promotion is available.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Next, the item synthesis window appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the synthesis window, red, blue, and green stones were rotating in circles.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Starting item synthesis!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Selected Materials – Low-grade fire elemental stone, low-grade water elemental stone, low-grade wind elemental stone]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Completed Item – Low-grade Promotion Stone]

  She held a rainbow-colored stone in her arms.
 </p>

 <p>
  [Congratulations on your upcoming promotion, Master Loki!]
 </p>
 <p>
  I wordlessly accepted the rainbow-colored stone that Iselle threw to me.

 <p>
  [With this, you can graduate to 2-star. From here, you’ll climb all the way to 7-star! Crush the Tower and conquer! Woohoo!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t know if I can make it to 7-star.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Haha, who will push to 7-star if not Loki!]
 </p>
 <p>
  If that were the case, Seris would have already been a 7-star.
 </p>
 <p>
  I made efforts in all directions, but I couldn’t promote her to the level of a 7-star hero.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, let’s start the promotion!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Creak.
 </p>
 <p>
  The door of the synthesis center opened.
 </p>
 <p>
  I held the promotion stone in one hand and walked slowly inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the synthesis center, with a violet magic circle drawn, another door opened.
 </p>
 <p>
  I entered the second door.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Promotion Hall had a structure almost identical to the Synthesis Center. Instead, the magic circle was red, and in the center of the room, there was a small altar big enough to place a stone. I placed the Promotion Stone on the altar.
 </p>
 <p>
  A faint red light emanated from the Promotion Stone.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  The door of the Synthesis Center slammed shut loudly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The door of the Promotion Hall closed immediately afterward.
 </p>
 <p>
  Promotion.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was one of the areas that the Master couldn’t see.
 </p>

 <p>
  When a hero and the materials were put into the Promotion Hall, the hero would come out in a promoted state after a while. The Master couldn’t know what happened inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  A red light sprayed out from the entire magic circle.
 </p>
 <p>
  Similar to the light the spatial rift usually emits, but somehow it felt more attached to the skin.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was like sinking into deep water.
 </p>
 <p>
  The red light enveloped my entire body.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I opened my eyes again.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Darling.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A narrow and humble room made of wood.
 </p>
 <p>
  A middle-aged woman sat on a rocking chair, holding a newborn baby in her arms.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good boy, good boy.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Who are you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  No response.
 </p>
 <p>
  This woman seemed to be in a similar state as the NPCs on the 10th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  But she was a bit different.
 </p>
 <p>
  Tong.
 </p>
 <p>
  I reached out to the woman, but my hand bounced back midway.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Can’t even touch her.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked around the room.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a place less than 10 square meters. The furniture was old and shabby.
 </p>
 <p>
  The woman with black hair and black eyes gently caressed the baby and said, “You will become an amazing person.”

 <p>
  Her touch was filled with affection.
 </p>
 <p>
  I intuitively grasped the baby’s identity.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Han Israt.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s not me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I have no family or anything of that sort.
 </p>
 <p>
  The one who should have been here instead of me was over there.
 </p>
 <p>
  I recalled my first visit to the waiting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Han Israt from the Haim Peninsula.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle called me that name.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the window in the corner of the room.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  Beyond the window, an unknown darkness lurked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good boy, good boy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I don’t have time to waste on something like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  Conveniently, there was a door on the right wall leading outside. I grabbed the doorknob. This time, it didn’t bounce back. I opened the door and rushed outside.
 </p>
 <p>
  As I came out, it was the square of the waiting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, this square was open, devoid of any decorations.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t Anytng’s waiting room. I couldn’t tell what this place was.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sky had no lights on.
 </p>
 <p>
  I walked slowly through the empty waiting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was only one door in the square in front of him. There was no dormitory, warehouse, or training center.
 </p>

 <p>
  I looked behind me and the door I had come out of had disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked ahead, and the nameplate on the door read “The Rift of Time and Space.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Squeak.
 </p>
 <p>
  The door opened with an unpleasant sound, and something sprayed out with light.
 </p>
 <p>
  Two pairs of wings sparkling with stardust.
 </p>
 <p>
  That black dress and that unique cute face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this Iselle?”
 </p>
 <p>
  No, she’s different.
 </p>
 <p>
  This little one was about the size of a fist. Iselle is not this small.
 </p>
 <p>
  The fairy fluttered around me and giggled. Then, with her tiny finger, she pointed to the inside of the spatial rift.
 </p>

 <p>
  “You want me to go in?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Nod.
 </p>
 <p>
  Suspicious, but staying here won’t change anything.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took a deep breath and stepped into the spatial rift.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the center of the circular room, there was only one mirror.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  The door leading back to the square closed. The fairy kept buzzing around me. Blacklight began to seep out of the mirror.
 </p>
 <p>
  The pitch-black light wrapped around me without any resistance.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then, I found myself standing alone in a dark space.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-12" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  “Dudung!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Astral Dungeon is now open!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Warning! Warning! Warning!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Instantly, a crushing pressure enveloped my entire body.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I dropped to one knee.
 </p>
 <p>
  It felt like someone was pressing me down from above with a mechanical press.
 </p>
 <p>
  My vision blurred. I couldn’t breathe. If I let my guard down even a little, I felt like my whole body would crumple and become a handful of minced meat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “‘Han(★)’ feels terror! All attributes decreased by 30%.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I drew my sword and stabbed it into the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t tell if it was the ground or something else. It was just pitch-black.
 </p>
 <p>
  I clung to the hilt of the sword and desperately endured. My body trembled, and blood oozed from my clenched teeth.
 </p>
 <p>
  At this rate, I’ll lose consciousness.
 </p>
 <p>
  I need to do something.
 </p>
 <p>
  So in the heat of the moment, I cut my left palm with the sword. Blood dripped from the edge of the blade.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment, I could feel the sensation of breaking through something.
 </p>
 <p>
  “‘Han(★)’ has entered a Frenzied state!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “‘Han(★)’ is no longer under terror.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hoo…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Haah.”
 </p>

 <p>
  I slowly took a breath in and exhaled.
 </p>
 <p>
  Regaining control of my body.
 </p>
 <p>
  I stood up.
 </p>
 <p>
  And she stood in front of me.

 <p>
  The title of a king.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was not a laughable statement.

  “They are still desperately searching for you, the heroes of Niflheimr. They even know that you’ve fallen here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The girl spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Think about it. Would any hero in the world relentlessly search every dimension for months just because their master disappeared? Would you do that? Would the heroes from other waiting rooms do that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The fairy placed both hands on her waist and shook her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  It meant ‘no.’
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your way of playing is very unique. At the same time, it’s worldly-wise. I never thought of it. I never expected to encounter a master who doesn’t use synthesis.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t completely abstain from using synthesis. If it was necessary, I did it.
 </p>
 <p>
  But as the girl said, if I were a different master, it would be true that I would use synthesis more to operate the waiting room, probably synthesizing two to three times a day. Looking back to before I was summoned, the last synthesis would have been three months ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The same goes for other operations. Before you became known, almost all the masters in Pick Me Up treated the heroes like toys. They played with them until they got bored and then discarded them like consumables.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The girl spoke with a confident tone.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you know that the heroes were actually humans? Or did you just feel that it won’t be impossible? I feel like you knew. That’s my conclusion.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I had thought it was a special game.
 </p>
 <p>
  The heroes within were so realistic that it was hard to believe they were game characters created by programmers. Each one reacted differently and had different ways of doing things according to their commands.
 </p>
 <p>
  But it wasn’t that I believed they were actual humans.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It was just more efficient.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ordinary masters control the heroes through synthesis.
 </p>
 <p>
  If there were disobedient or worthless ones, they would dispose of them mercilessly and operate the waiting room with fear instilled in the others. Even if there were lower-tier heroes who showed potential, they would end up as food for higher-tier heroes.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was different.

 <p>
  I never obtained a natural-born 5-star hero. I only had one 4-star hero.
 </p>
 <p>
  People advised me to give up, saying it was a failed account.
 </p>
 <p>
  But I didn’t give up.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was accustomed to irrationality. So, I just searched for a way forward, and accordingly, my perspective changed. I had to organize the waiting room with 3-star and lower heroes and carry out all the strategies.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if their rank was low, I wouldn’t discard them if they showed potential.
 </p>
 <p>
  At first, they might seem useless heroes, but they could change later on.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the waiting room was operated solely through fear, it would inevitably crumble.
 </p>
 <p>
  After investigating, I found that in Pick Me Up, there were several ways to control the heroes depending on the gameplay. I analyzed and grasped them to use them appropriately when needed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Proof of value brings rewards.
 </p>
 <p>
  For worthlessness and laziness, punishment.

 <p>
  If there were those who went beyond useless and became a hindrance, I utilized them as ‘disposable pawns.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The second party that I dispatched as the vanguard for the Advent Dungeon was the result of this. Those guys had a tendency not to be suitable for long-term use, causing harm to nearby heroes.
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t use synthesis unless it was absolutely necessary.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s how Niflheimr was designed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the main party, known as the strongest across all servers, there were five members.
 </p>
 <p>
  And among them, there were heroes who had started from the 1-star grade.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since I didn’t use synthesis, it naturally led to an increase in the waiting room population.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a result, Niflheimr grew to a size similar to a kingdom.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, there is nothing more foolish than misunderstanding the results of my analysis of game efficiency as ‘knowing the truth.’
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, you do like me too?”

  “Yes. I really wanted to talk with you. It’s a shame that it couldn’t happen on Earth.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I feel the same way. If we had met on Earth, I would have wiped you out right away.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The girl blinked her eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  I smirked and spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You bought my resentment. Among other things, I’ll probably never forget that. I have nothing in my heart for you but hatred..”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Whether it’s Townia or Niflheimr, I don’t care about either of them. I’m a human from Earth. Don’t force your situation on others.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehe, you don’t care, huh? Niflheimr’s heroes will be disappointed if they hear you say that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let them be disappointed as much as they want.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t grasp this girl’s intentions.

 <p>
  If you purely wanted me to help them climb the tower, you didn’t have to bring me here. The Niflheimr’s party was progressing diligently through the strategies. They had already reached the 88th floor, surpassing the 85th floor, and 90th floor—The Demonic Wall where the 1st rank was staying—was right in front of them.
 </p>
 <p>
  But amidst all that, she brought me here.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, she invaded the 10th floor and even brought me here to talk to me about useless things. With such limited information, I couldn’t make any predictions.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, there was one thing I could tell, that this girl didn’t care at all about others if it was for her own benefit.
 </p>
 <p>
  If I keep that in mind, I can make an efficient judgment.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I won’t cooperate with you or anything like that. In fact, you better be gone right now before my patience reaches its limit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You could become a hero who saves Mobius, though.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The girl laughed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, it doesn’t matter. There’s only one thing I want from you. To safely climb the tower to where I am. If you can do that, I can endure any level of insult.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Was it you who made the black priests appear on the 10th floor?”
 </p>

 <p>
  “And if it was?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I clenched my teeth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t get too worked up. I won’t intervene from the 15th floor onward. Townia will give you a thrilling welcome even without my intervention. It’s an S-class difficulty just like Niflheim.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No matter how well you do, I estimate the probability of the master folding to be at least 90%. Well, it might be different if I’m helping you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The girl stood up from her chair.
 </p>
 <p>
  The black leather seat instantly turned into ashes and disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I swear on this one thing. If you achieve the feat of climbing the tower to the very end, I’ll send you back to where you were originally. And one more thing, I’ll transfer half of my stake in Mobius to you. You’ll become a major shareholder of a global conglomerate, fighting for control in the world.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A major shareholder of Mobius.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I don’t believe it.’

 <p>
  The promise of sending me back, the reward.
 </p>
 <p>
  As I climb the tower, more information I didn’t know will be revealed.
 </p>
 <p>
  I will return on my own strength. I won’t rely on such garbage.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anyway, is the contract established?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The girl asked with a smug expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “As long as you don’t appear in front of me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You really seem to hate me. Why?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why did you even ask?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well….”
 </p>
 <p>
  I pulled out the second dagger and hurled it at the girl’s forehead.

  The dagger pierced through her skull, deeply embedded in its hilt.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is my answer.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehehe…”

  The next day.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the dawn after the day’s schedule had ended, while wiping off the sweat on the chair in the training camp, the sky lit up.

  [Welcome to Pick Me Up!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The loading is complete.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [TOUCH! (Select)]
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a familiar login message.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, there was also an alert indicating a new announcement.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Apology for Server Errors&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “A few days ago, an unfortunate disconnection issue occurred…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Below that, there was a post apologizing for the simultaneous disconnection that occurred to the Masters on the lower floors of the tower, explaining that it was due to a sudden server shortage.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was due to that girl who appeared when we were about to clear the 10th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t grasp the entire situation, but I knew it was related to her.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Error Compensation!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “1. Special reward for all Masters! 500 gems will be given.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “2. Get rewarded even more! 50,000 gold will be given.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “3. There’s more! Increase your favorability with the heroes! Gift vouchers will be given.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “4. And it doesn’t end here! All weekly dungeons will be open for 3 days.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng closed the announcement and went to his mailbox to receive the rewards.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, he started touching the control screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ping!

  Iselle approached, scattering stardust.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Congratulations on your promotion, Loki!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle set off a firework she had brought from somewhere.
 </p>
 <p>
  “….”
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no one at the training camp.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron and Dica were here, but they just left.
 </p>
 <p>
  As she sat there quietly, Iselle tilted her head in concern.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You look upset. Is something wrong?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [I met the original.]

 <p>
  “The original? What do you mean…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle was deep in thought, and then her mouth opened wide in surprise.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Is it the co-representative director of Mobius?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Y-You must be kidding!]
 </p>
 <p>
  I lifted her hanging jaw up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle spoke in a trembling voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  [How much did she tell you?]
 </p>
 <p>
  I summarized the information I heard from that girl about this world and told her.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle nodded seriously, she even looked a bit concerned.
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled and said,

  “I don’t really care. There’s nothing to argue about. I’ll climb the tower. You just need to help me with that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ah, got it…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, what’s the matter?”
 </p>
 <p>
  It wouldn’t have been a trivial matter for Iselle to appear like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle erased her stern expression and burst into laughter with delight. Then, she took out a golden ticket about the size of her body.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do you know what this is? Let’s name it a Gift Ticket! Whatever you want, you can have it instantly!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle held the golden ticket in her hand and swayed her body as if she were dancing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “A gift, huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  In Pick Me Up, there was a function called “gift” which allowed players to reward special achievements or give presents to their favorite heroes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, it wasn’t free.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
  <script async="" crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4984013611805253">

  <script>
   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Depending on the value of the gift, players had to pay gold, and for high-grade rare gifts, gems or premium materials were required. It was similar to the concept of the clock I had requested during the facility’s large-scale expansion.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you giving this to me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [More precisely, to the Master! Hehe! Even that foolish guy finally recognized Loki’s excellence.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle extended the golden ticket towards me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I accepted the ticket and examined it. On both sides of the ticket were engravings of fairies, and in the center was the number “10,000.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “10,000 gold or less.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gifts were usually paid for, but if you used a rare gift voucher given out during events, you could use the function for free.
 </p>
 <p>
  “He really values me highly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The fact that he only gave me the gift voucher meant he considered me the highest among all the heroes here.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a sense, it was obvious.
 </p>

 <p>
  Not out of conceit, but because it was the truth.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the main character who had cleared two consecutive missions that seemed impossible, even if you watched the strategy screen, you would notice that Edis and Eolka’s contributions were outstanding, but I was at the center of it all.
 </p>
 <p>
  It must have been fascinating.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite not doing anything particularly special, the heroes somehow managed to survive.
 </p>
 <p>
  I did struggle a bit on the 10th floor, which went beyond the normal difficulty, but I cleared it. The result was even more remarkable. The main members survived without losing anyone except for two 1-star heroes.
 </p>
 <p>
  After letting out a sigh, I returned the ticket to Iselle.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t need it. Give it to someone else.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★★)’ refuses the gift.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle’s eyes widened in surprise as she took the ticket.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Are you sure? You can have anything you want! Delicious dishes! Gorgeous clothes! Beautiful decorations! You can have it all!]

  “I don’t need everything.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The gift shop had more than thousands of items to offer.
 </p>
 <p>
  Exquisite delicacies made from rare ingredients. Lavish attire suitable for nobles. Artworks exude a nostalgic charm. If you raise the conditions a bit more, there are even items that surpass imagination. Of course, such things cannot be bought with a mere 10,000 gold.
 </p>
 <p>
  I got up from my seat and left the training camp.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, I slowly walked back to my lodging.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle followed me eagerly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why are you following me? I’m going to sleep.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [W-Wait.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle turned around in place. Stardust scattered from her wings, and a small wooden statue appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Using the gift voucher to purchase a ‘Warhorse Statue.’]

  [Gifting the ‘Warhorse Statue’ to ‘Han (★★)’!)
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tips/You can give gifts to heroes you like. Give gifts to increase the hero’s favorability!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s a gift from the Master!]
 </p>
 <p>
  A noble warhorse with a proud front leg stance was sculpted.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took the statue and examined it from all sides. The craftsmanship was not bad, and the finishing was well done.
 </p>
 <p>
  There would be heroes who would be pleased to receive this.
 </p>
 <p>
  I casually tossed the statue.
 </p>
 <p>
  It hit the side of a fountain and rolled over, breaking the front leg and separating the upper and lower parts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle’s mouth hung open in shock.
 </p>
 <p>
  I lifted her hanging jaw up once again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then I closed the door to my lodging and went inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you’re going to give gifts, give them to everyone.”

 <p>
  Light streamed out from the open door of the inn.
 </p>
 <p>
  I knew in advance what was happening through the message, but it wasn’t the case for Edis.

 <p>
  I looked outside the door and spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems like the new recruits have arrived.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I see, then if people like Roderick and Eolka are here, it would be time for a draft…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re not doing a draft. No need for that, and they won’t even be able to join our party.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait and you’ll see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I put down my teacup and stood up from my seat. Then, I went out to the square.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the entrance of the square’s summoning portal, two men and a woman were gathered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Um, could we talk no need for violence…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t want to! He stinks, and you also stink! Understand?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What did you say, you b*tch? I’m being nice to you….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just because I’m a woman, you think I’m an easy target? You’re a joke of a man.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The two immediately drew their weapons.
 </p>
 <p>

  [‘Tashir (★★★)’ shows hostility towards ‘Majel (★★★)’!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hostile relationship established! Observe the heroes’ interactions carefully!]
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as they appeared, what a spectacle.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is beyond ridiculous, I couldn’t even hold my laughter.

 <p>
  “Hey, by any chance, are you the first ones here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  A young man with a polished armor and a sword approached me. He seemed more like a boy than a young man. There was a hint of youthfulness in his features.
 </p>
 <p>
  I replied.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m Stein Lastov. An apprentice knight. Would you mind if I join you two? These guys don’t listen to me…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No way I’d listen. Who asked for a boy like you with an air of arrogance to order us?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What did you say?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I agree with that. Who would listen to a spoiled young noble like you? Look at your face you call yourself a knight I bet your mama has a pretty face like that too, how about you bring her to me instead, I would listen to her!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can forgive insults against me, but insults against my parents are unforgivable!”
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  Clang!
 </p>
 <p>
  Drawing his longsword, Stein rushed at the two.
 </p>
 <p>
  A standoff between two turned into a standoff between three.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s going on? Why are those people acting like that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis, who came out late, had a bewildered expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Their personalities don’t match.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even among heroes, compatibility exists.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some heroes gain bonus abilities when put together in a party, while others might decrease each other’s abilities. Still, cases, where hostility was established immediately upon summoning and escalated to actual combat, were rare.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll teach this arrogant brat some manners!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The one who took the initiative was Tashir, a man with a somewhat rough appearance.
 </p>

 <p>
  Tashir’s chain-scythe rotated in spirals as he fired it towards Stein.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang!
 </p>
 <p>
  The chain-scythe collided with an invisible barrier and faltered.
 </p>
 <p>
  [“What’s wrong with these idiots! Are you crazy? Want to die?”]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle, who appeared belatedly, widened her eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who are you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [“If I speak for myself, I’m Iselle! I’m the Master’s representative. Don’t get cocky. I’m much older than you guys.”]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Master.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Stein frowned. He seemed to remember something.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Anyway, don’t fight recklessly in the waiting room. I won’t warn you a second time. You understand?]

  “Then keep me away from this noble and that ruffian. We don’t get along. If I were to form a party… I want that guy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Majel pointed at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Majel, with heavy makeup, wore a dress that hugged her figure. In her right hand, she held a sword with a serrated blade. Regardless, I didn’t seem to be of an age where she would call me “Oppa.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You don’t decide the party. The Master does.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle dismissed Majel’s demand and disappeared with a “poof.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Following that, the party composition window appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Forming a party.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Drag and drop the heroes!]

 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is he trying to form a party with those three?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Heroes with established hostility are being put together in the same party.
 </p>
 <p>
  Efficiency was undoubtedly at its worst.
 </p>
 <p>
  While it’s possible to gradually ease relationships over time, such a thought probably wouldn’t cross Anytng’s mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Open, the rift of time and space!]
 </p>
 <p>
  So, in such a situation, it’s unlikely that these three will work together, maybe even worse…
 </p>
 <p>
  I sighed and headed back to the inn.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no need to watch any longer. Edis followed and asked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Han, where are you going?”

  “I need some sleep.”

 <p>
  “What about those people?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They won’t be coming back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I entered my room in the inn and sat down on the bed.
 </p>
 <p>
  As expected, the system messages I had anticipated appeared at the top.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Tashir (★★★)’ has entered a state of madness.]
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Stein (★★★)’ is bleeding. Health will decrease periodically.]

 <p>
  Madness status disorder.
 </p>
 <p>
  They perceive allies as enemies.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle might be able to stop this in the waiting room, but can’t prevent this on the stage.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Majel (★★★)’ has entered a state of madness.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ally Attack!]
 </p>
 <p>
  I don’t know exactly what floors they were sent to, but it was safe to assume it wasn’t a low one.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Stein (★★★)’, Eliminated an Ally!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Tashir (★★★)’ has returned to the embrace of the goddess. His determination will forever be remembered.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Tashir was the first to die.
 </p>
 <p>
  Following that, the second death message popped up.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Majel (★★★)’ has returned to the embrace of the goddess. Her determination will forever be remembered.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Stein (★★★)’ falls into despair. All attributes are reduced by 80%.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A moment later.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Stein (★★★)’ has returned to the embrace of the goddess. His determination will forever be remembered.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Party 3’ has been wiped out.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You Lose!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Without finishing a single battle, Party 3 was wiped out.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the first wipeout since the previous free 10-draw.
 </p>
 <p>
  The cost was the deaths of three 3-star heroes.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, would you like to end your connection?]

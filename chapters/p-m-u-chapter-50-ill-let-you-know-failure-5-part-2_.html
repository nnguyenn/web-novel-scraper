 <p>
  Preparations were over.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sat on the bench and waited for the results.

 <p>
  The people who had gathered in the plaza returned to their original places. Anxious expressions could be seen on their faces. It seemed like they were hoping they wouldn’t return.
 </p>
 <p>
  About five minutes had passed since Party 3 entered the 15th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  The plaza was nearly empty. We couldn’t see how the mission was progressing. It was clear that the crisis hadn’t yet struck. There we no messages popping up…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm?”
 </p>
 <p>
  With sound effects, several messages appeared in succession.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Mission Failed!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Target – Annihilation]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Nokin (★★★)’ has returned to the embrace of the goddess. His determination will be remembered eternally.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Winard (★★★)’ has returned to the embrace of the goddess. His determination will be remembered eternally.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Zelan (★★★)’ has returned to the embrace of the goddess. His determination will be remembered eternally.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Roberil (★)’ has returned to the embrace of the goddess. His determination will be remembered eternally.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Juan (★)’ has returned to the embrace of the goddess. His determination will be remembered eternally.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Party 3’ has been annihilated.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You Lose!]
 </p>
 <p>
  It hadn’t been even 10 minutes since they entered.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A special mission, was it?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Five of them died simultaneously.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were no abnormal conditions like bleeding or cardiac arrest that would usually occur before death.

 <p>
  Kugwang!
 </p>
 <p>
  A temporary vibration ran through the entire waiting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna swayed in her seat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “W-What’s, what’s happening? Why all of a sudden…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Zap!
 </p>
 <p>
  With a sound like something sizzling, a blue current ran along the plaza’s wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle came out with a pale face and said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master threw his phone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, would you like to end the connection?]

  [Goodbye then!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng ended the connection.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle grabbed onto my clothes and trembled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I think we’re in big trouble, what should we do!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There are a lot of people watching, so let go for now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I detached Iselle, who was clinging to my sleeve, and spoke to the people looking at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The spectacle is over. Let’s go back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What about Party 3?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They’re wiped out.”

  They hadn’t even started, yet they were obliterated.
 </p>
 <p>
  They probably didn’t even get a hint about the strategy for the 15th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a total disaster.
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis murmured with a disappointed voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It hasn’t been that long since they went in.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Their abilities must have been limited to that extent.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Anyway, our business here is finished.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no need to stay in the plaza. I returned to my lodging.
 </p>
 <p>
  After that, Anytng didn’t log in for a long time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle came to my room every evening and asked what to do, sobbing softly.

  Crying wouldn’t change anything. Regardless of the situation, I did what I could do. It was the first principle I set to survive here.
 </p>
 <p>
  The routine remained unchanged.
 </p>
 <p>
  Waking up in the morning, training after meals. Training again until evening. It had been a long time since I had been in an actual battle. To keep my skills sharp, we engaged in sparring using real weapons.
 </p>
 <p>
  More than a week had passed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The 1-star members, excluding the main members, could not be seen. The fear of synthesis had vanished. The number of people training in the field had decreased significantly. Fewer people voluntarily went to the Weekly Dungeon as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  And time passed again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ten days on the waiting room’s calendar. In reality, it had been more than three days since the last login.
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, lights lit up the sky for no reason.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Welcome to Pick Me Up!]
 </p>
 <p>
  And the familiar login message appeared.

  [Loading is complete.]

  [T O U C H! (selected)]
 </p>
 <p>
  It was dawn.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was the only one left in the training ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom! Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  Flashes continuously burst in the brightly shining sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  *Click!*

 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng, who had logged in after a long time, took a screenshot and left.
 </p>
 <p>
  From login to logout, it didn’t even take a minute.
 </p>
 <p>
  I put my sword back into its sheath.
 </p>
 <p>
  I left behind the battered wooden statue and headed out of the training ground. I walked quickly and called out.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Iselle!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hm?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle appeared, rubbing her eyes. Instead of her usual black dress, she was wearing pajamas with a white cat design and had a furry hat on her head.

  “Why did you call? I was sleeping…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Oh, well.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master has logged in.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, Master… What did you say?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Wide awake, Iselle looked around.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where, where is he? What happened? Where is he?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He just left.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “After such a long time of not logging in, why didn’t you do anything? Don’t tell me he just logged in and logged out…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can’t do anything. But he took a screenshot.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why a screenshot?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why do you think?”
 </p>
 <p>
  To have a memorial photo?
 </p>
 <p>
  That wouldn’t make sense. I closed the door.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle was staring at me with a look of confusion.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s your hobby, Iselle?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I told you it was web surfing last time. Why are you asking that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Because I want to verify if you can access the internet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, of course. Wait, why?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle tilted her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  I said,

  He only needed to ask about how to solve the problem at hand. There was no need to expose his own playing records.

  There were comments under the post.

  There were many mocking comments ridiculing Anytng.

  Although a few users wrote tips, they were mostly buried, and even those were mostly incorrect advice.

  “I’m not sure where to start helping from. The post might get a bit long. Anyway, make sure to thoroughly read the posts on the strategy board. Start with Loki’s post.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At most, they were telling him to look at the strategy board. It wasn’t difficult to understand why this was a task that required a complete overhaul of gameplay.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at Iselle.
 </p>
 <p>
  She was maintaining her pose, sweat dripping down.
 </p>
 <p>
  “She seems already at her limit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If I had unlimited internet, I would have explained through comments everything he needed to do one by one, but I don’t have much time. I entered Google Drive with my email and downloaded the document files that were stored. After the download was complete, I gave them a quick look. Then I returned to the cafe’s comments.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Loki&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Check your mail. Just read that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I right-clicked on Anytng’s username and selected ‘Send Message’. After sending the message, I clicked on ‘Send Mail’. I attached the document file and sent it.

 </p>
 <p>
  The comments began to flood in.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the comment section, the topic about Anytng had disappeared, replaced by irrelevant discussions, mainly related to me. There were even people trying to initiate one-on-one conversations.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Should have made it a private comment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At least the usernames remain.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as I was about to add a new comment, Iselle’s scream echoed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Noo!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I got it, I got it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as I closed the internet window, Iselle staggered and collapsed to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  The window disappeared. This opportunity seemed to have come to an end.

  “Good job. Thanks to you, it’s over.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Did it work? Did it really work?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “It depends on how Anytng responds.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle wiped her forehead with sweat and asked me.
 </p>
 <p>
  [It felt like you sent him a document, what’s in it?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “My play records. Among other things.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Don’t tell me it’s the ‘Sky Disc’!]
 </p>
 <p>
  What on earth is that?
 </p>
 <p>
  [There’s a rumor. The currently available Loki guide isn’t the complete version. The real guide is said to be hidden by Loki. It’s said to contain everything about Pik-Me-Up!.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle came closer, exhaling through her nose.

  Her face was as red as a strawberry.
 </p>
 <p>
  [And you, you sent that, the rumored guide, to the Master?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “For now, step back. I’ll tell you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I pushed Iselle away as she tried to get closer.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle nodded her head absentmindedly and then took a few steps back. She then knelt in front of me with a respectful posture.
 </p>
 <p>
  [So, the truth! Please tell me!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s partially correct.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s true that my guide posted on the official cafe is incomplete. While it includes information about valuing facilities and not discarding lower-grade heroes recklessly, along with various tips, it lacks essential operational methods.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had become lazy in the process of writing it.
 </p>

 <p>
  I also didn’t feel the need to fully disclose the results of my analysis and research.
 </p>
 <p>
  That guide was nothing more than a roughly written draft, lacking much thought. I didn’t even realize it would cause such a stir.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if Anytng had only relied on my guide, his gameplay wouldn’t be entirely flawless. The early stages might be relatively detailed, but from the mid-game, it became quite informal.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What I sent to the Master were my gameplay records and the data I analyzed over the two years I’ve been playing Pik-Me-Up. There is even some information about thesis-like materials.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [To think that existed…]
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t be sure that everything about Pik-Me-Up was contained there, but it would be true that everything about me was.
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t guarantee whether Anytng would read my email.
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t even be more sure if he would read all the contents of the document. First of all, it was large in size. In terms of volume, it would be equivalent to several thick books. And since I hadn’t considered that someone else would end up reading it, it was also difficult to understand and unfriendly.
 </p>
 <p>
  But if he were to read all of it,
 </p>
 <p>
  If he were to make it his own,
 </p>
 <p>
  Things would become quite interesting.
 </p>
 <p>
  With this, I’ve done what I can.
 </p>
 <p>
  The rest is just waiting for a response.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether he will lose interest in the game and quit,
 </p>
 <p>
  Or whether he will take on the challenge again.
 </p>
 <p>
  I made slight modifications at the end of the document. It should give me a sign of Anytng’s intentions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng’s connection occurred exactly three days and three hours after his last visit.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Welcome to Pik-Me-Up!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Loading complete.”

  I sat on a bench in the square and gazed up at the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  I threw the dagger in my right hand and caught it. Anytng had started controlling the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  He entered the management tab and pressed the gift icon.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Purchasing ‘Warhorse Statue’ for 5,000 gold.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Gifting ‘Warhorse Statue’ to ‘Han(★★)’!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle appeared next to the fountain.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nestled in her small chest was a wooden statue that I had once broken, now new. Iselle approached with a puzzled expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Why is he giving you this again…?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Give it here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Are you going to break it again?]

  I took the warhorse statue from Iselle’s embrace.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han(★★)’ is delighted to receive the ‘Warhorse Statue’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Affection increased!]
 </p>
 <p>
  I smirked.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle looked at me even more confused.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s written at the end of the guide. Give the warhorse statue to the hero you like.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even if he didn’t accept it the first time, he will delightedly accept it if you do it a second time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He had read that thick document to the end.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the statue in hand, I stood up from the bench.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had the statue in my hand. I could place it anywhere I wanted.
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t need a half-hearted Master.
 </p>
 <p>
  If I really were to climb the top of the tower, I couldn’t settle for anything less than the pinnacle of a hundred million users. Without reaching that level, no one could handle me properly.
 </p>
 <p>
  He might not have understood the content of the entire document yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  But…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘As long as you trust me, and trust yourself.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I murmured.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll make you the best.”

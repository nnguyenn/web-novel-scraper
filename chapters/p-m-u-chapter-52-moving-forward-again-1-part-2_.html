 <p>
  The main door at the front of the square opened.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was an expedition after a long time. The 1st party with Edis proceeded into the circular room.
 </p>

 <p>
  The door closed, and an alert indicating the current floor level appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Main Dungeon, current challenge floor is the 8th floor.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The door will open in 10 seconds. Get ready!]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The 8th floor.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I recollected.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the stage with 27 Goblin Riders appearing.
 </p>
 <p>
  The field was a plain, and thanks to Eolka, there had been quite a struggle at that time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dazzling light spewed from the mirror on the left side of the room.
 </p>
 <p>
  When the light subsided, the familiar sight of the plain came into view.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud thud thud.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sound of the ground shaking from behind was also familiar.
 </p>
 <p>
  I drew my sword and shield and said, “You recognize where this is, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The 8th floor.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron aimed his spear at the rear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna readied an arrow for her bow. Eolka was calmly regulating her breathing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s time to show the results of our training.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Our time wasn’t just spent idly during the strike.
 </p>
 <p>
  We engaged in consistent training akin to real combat while balancing our condition adjustments. Although we hadn’t leveled up, there hadn’t been a single day wasted.

 <p>
  “I know.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eolka waved her clothing and extended her right hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  There, Goblin Riders charging toward us were present.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eolka’s eyes glowed blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  【Invert!】
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ki-yah?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The ground shaker that was in front of the goblins flipped and then shot up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mud and stones swirled, sweeping the leading goblin riders. The formation scattered instantly. It was a technique utilizing telekinesis power.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ping! Ping ping ping!
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna, in a lowered stance, shot arrows like a barrage. The process of taking an arrow from the quiver, nocking it, and pulling for the shot flowed as smoothly as water. It was the effect of a bow skill she had perfected through rigorous training.

 </div>
 <p>
  The target was the goblins approaching Eolka with their crossbows.
 </p>
 <p>
  The arrows pierced the vital points of the goblins without a single miss. Not one succeeded in releasing their bolts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eolka continued her casting without any hindrance.
 </p>
 <p>
  The spell’s casting time was only around 10 seconds.
 </p>
 <p>
  【Ignite!】
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Flames burst out in a wide fan shape from the end of Eolka’s sleeve.
 </p>
 <p>
  The flames engulfed the goblin riders head-on.
 </p>
 <p>
  Goblins caught in the flames writhed alongside wolves.
 </p>
 <p>
  Wolves that were charging from behind hesitated and retreated. Eolka’s flames, which had incinerated several goblins and wolves, writhed and expanded like a living snake.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  The linear formation collapsed in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sharp spear-like charging force lost its direction. Now, what remained there were not goblin riders, but goblins and wolves wriggling in flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is the finishing touch.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I flipped my sword and charged into the front line.
 </p>
 <p>
  The range of flames spread beneath my feet. It didn’t matter. I hadn’t trained in flame resistance as a formality. Engulfed in fire, I systematically slew goblins and wolves one by one. Some resisted, but I effortlessly crushed them. Aaron also joined in the aftermath.
 </p>
 <p>
  I thrust my sword into the back of a goblin fleeing on the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  This one was the last.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stage cleared!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Aaron(★)’, ‘Eolka(★★★)’ level up!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Reward – 3,000G, Wolf Leather]

 <p>
  [MVP – ‘Eolka(★★★)’]
 </p>
 <p>
  Battle concluded.
 </p>
 <p>
  I wiped the blood off my sword and sheathed it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Why am I even here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis muttered in a disheartened voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled wordlessly and exited the Rift of Time and Space.
 </p>
 <p>
  This time is clearly different from the last.
 </p>
 <p>
  Back then, I had to allow the goblin riders to charge several times.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna’s shooting speed wasn’t fast enough to suppress the goblins’ crossbows, and Eolka, who stubbornly kept casting a one-minute fire spell, was prone to be targeted. But now, it’s different. The battle has become much more flexible. As a result, all 27 goblin riders were wiped out without successfully completing a single charge.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I need to level up.”

 <p>
  Edis still hasn’t fully adapted to our party’s style, but she has a great instinct. So, as we go through battles, she will naturally find her role.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Roderick, Asher, Dica!]
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as the 1st party returned to the waiting room, Iselle called the members of the 2nd party.
 </p>
 <p>
  Roderick and two others came out to the square, led by Roderick. It seemed like the 2nd party was trying to level up as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis shook her head hesitantly and then approached the 2nd party.
 </p>
 <p>
  I asked Edis,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Going for a double jump?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A double jump? I haven’t even managed a single one.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis smiled bitterly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, looking at the sky, she whispered something.
 </p>

 <p>
  [‘Edis(★★★)’ wants to join ‘2nd party’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon, Edis’ affiliation changed to the 2nd party.
 </p>
 <p>
  For a while, she will have a busy life alternating between the 1st party and the 2nd party.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Rift of Time and Space closed behind the 2nd Party.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re done for today, right? Using magic has drained me completely.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eolka stretched and yawned.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking at Jenna and Aaron, she spoke,
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you two going to do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll keep training. After all, we’re about to tackle the 15th floor.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You guys don’t seem to get tired.”

 <p>
  Eolka let out a sigh and walked towards the lodgings.
 </p>
 <p>
  I grabbed Eolka’s sleeve.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not over.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re planning to keep going? You think using magic is easy?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry. You won’t be using your magic.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t believe you. You’ve tricked me once or twice before.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I dragged the sulking Eolka to the training grounds.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was something I had to do that should have been done the moment a magician joined the waiting room. It was way overdue.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Iselle.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [What’s up?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I need to do some research.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ah, I see!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle nodded and disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, a tip appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, there are personnel available for research.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [How about starting some research? The results of your research will be the foundation for smooth waiting room operations!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng brought up the control panel and touched the research tab.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took Eolka with me and entered the training grounds.
 </p>
 <p>
  The door leading to the Magic Hall was open.

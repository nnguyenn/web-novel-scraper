   <p>
    The leader drew a dagger from his belt.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    The two beside him retrieved small crossbows from their bosoms.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    I kicked the sword I had been holding on the instep and sent it flying upward. As it rotated, I caught the rising sword in my hand. Evading the dagger-like short swords that were directed at me, I plunged the blade into the back of one of the men’s necks. With my left hand, I drew a dagger from my belt and threw it. The dagger embedded itself in the eye of the soldier who had aimed a crossbow at me. I withdrew the sword from the neck and slashed the upper body of the soldier who lost all strength. Simultaneously, Edis’s thrown dragger struck the forehead of the third man like a dart.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    The bodies of the three humans spewed blood as they crumbled. Among the corpses, I stood with my sword dripping hot blood. The dense smell of blood surged even into my head.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    I spread out the blood-soaked blade and said, “Do you still intend to talk?”
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    I had seen a similar incident during my Master’s days.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    The enemies were humans, and the hesitant heroes perished.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    Negotiation didn’t exist.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    No matter who emerged, no matter how they emerged.

   <p>
    Aaron raised his head, then silently picked up the spear from the ground.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    An emotionless voice flowed from his mouth.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    “Do we have to kill them all?”
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>

   <p>
    Aaron tightened his grip on the spear and aimed at the enemies.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    The five soldiers were already in a combat stance.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    “Jenna, do you have any intention of sparing them?”
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>

    “Well, it’s fine. We’re in a desperate situation. We’re desperate!”
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    Squish!
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    An arrow that had left the quiver hit a soldier’s chest. He fell over with wide eyes. Due to the pressure from the ground, the arrow pierced through his chest and emerged from his back.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    “…”

    Eolka couldn’t care less.

   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    She had already started casting fire magic.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    Edis, watching this, muttered bitterly.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    “It seems I worried for nothing.”
   </p>
   <p>

    What I valued most in choosing party members wasn’t talent or strength, but mental resilience. It was the desire, the determination to do whatever it takes to survive.

   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    “Prepare for battle.”
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    The formation was complete.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    Aaron and I in the front, Jenna and Edis in the middle, and Eolka in the rear. With four enemies dead, they numbered nine. The soldiers charged at us with a clamor akin to the sound of metal clashing.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    “These guys aren’t normal.”

    Edis spun her daggers in her hands.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    Abnormal. Literally. Black veins resembling sinister tattoos sprawled across their faces and skin. Madness flickered in their pupils.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    【Ignite!】
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    Whoosh.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    A wall of flames surged forth in front of us.
   </p>

   </p>
   <p>
    “Aaah!”
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    Two soldiers engulfed in flames writhed in agony and perished.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    The metal plates of their heated armor glowed red.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    Through the flames, Jenna’s arrow pierced through the air.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    A middle-aged soldier with a beard lunged at me with a spear.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    I blocked with my shield while moving my left hand. The spearhead slid off the shield, causing the soldier to stagger. In front of him lay my sword. Accompanied by a splatter of blood, his neck was almost severed, and he collapsed while clutching his throat, gurgling as he died.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    ‘Weak.’
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    They may be properly equipped, but their formation and discipline were lacking.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    They charged haphazardly, swinging their weapons. It didn’t even take five minutes to sort them out. In an instant, twelve bodies littered the city square.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    Only one remained.
   </p>

    He sat trembling, quaking in fear.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    I wiped blood off my blade against the wall and approached the soldier. He spat and raised his voice.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    “Please spare me! Spare me! I have a wife and daughter waiting for me. I need to go back! Ba-back home. I need to go home!”
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    “How do you plan to go back?”

   <p>
   </p>

    The soldier grabbed his head and screamed.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    As the soldier screamed, black blood spewed from his mouth, and he collapsed. Then, his movement ceased. He was dead.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    Eolka grimaced and commented, “These people are strange.”
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    Edis sheathed her dagger on her belt.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    “They’ve been brainwashed. I’ve seen it a few times. Still, this level of thorough brainwashing on this many people is new. Well, if you think about it, last time…”
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    “Are they the same bastards?”
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yeah. We definitely killed them, but the same bastards showed up.”
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    I wiped the tar-like, thick, black blood off the ground.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    It was the same as that bi*ch.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    I still couldn’t figure it out. There were too few clues.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    But these guys were nothing special, they were just trapped on the 12th floor.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    Soon, light enveloped us.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    It was the return signal.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>

   </p>
   <p>
    [MVP – ‘Han (★★)’]
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    We returned through the rift.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    Edis had already left. The battle was easy, but weariness was etched on the faces of the three. I sheathed my sword and spoke.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    “Get used to it. I will too.”
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yeah. Whether it’s a monster or a human, there’s not much difference.”
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    The blood that had covered my body disappeared without a trace.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    However, the acrid smell lingered at the tip of my nose for a long while.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    Taking a life.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    There was no hesitation, no thrill, as I had imagined. It would be the same in the future. It was laughable to think that after killing so many monsters I would have a problem killing humans. I would do it if necessary. No matter who the opponent was.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    Back in my room, I organized my materials once again.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    Humanoid creatures appeared on the 12th floor. If similar guys appeared on the 13th and 14th floors, I could estimate the monsters that would appear on the 15th floor. Based on the methods and times of the three parties’ extermination, I could guess the nature of the mission.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    “….”
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    I couldn’t help but think about what happened again.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    Suddenly, a thought struck me.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    “Have I changed?”
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    Well, if I had, that would make sense.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    The me on Earth and the me in the waiting room had changed in many ways.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    But I didn’t have any regrets. There was no choice but to change. If I hadn’t, I would have died. It was inevitable.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    “Going back will be tough, readjusting again.”
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    I sighed and continued my work.

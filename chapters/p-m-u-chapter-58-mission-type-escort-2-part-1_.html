  “Simple logic.”
 </p>
 <p>
  During the 10th-floor defense mission, our allied soldiers and cavalry NPC allies couldn’t observe us.
 </p>

 <p>
  However, these guys can clearly recognize us. As I approached, I felt the gaze of an enemy. It meant this wasn’t an ordinary NPC.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eolka said, seeming perplexed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, they might not be enemies, you know?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s a possibility for that too. Don’t worry. I haven’t killed them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Half of them seem dead though…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Murmurs arose.
 </p>
 <p>
  Without warning, a comical scene unfolded, attracting a crowd of onlookers.
 </p>
 <p>
  One witness began explaining, gesturing wildly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, well. The soldier suddenly collapsed with a nosebleed. And the guy next to him, well, he did something too! He banged his head against the wall on his own. Like this, like this!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The man with his head shaved pretended to smash his head against the wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks to the spectators, the path to the square became a bit quieter. I grabbed the horn hanging from the soldier’s neck and tossed it into the sewer.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s go. We’re running out of time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  We crossed the gate and entered the square.
 </p>
 <p>
  The square was packed with people, so densely crowded that it was impossible to move. The noise from hundreds of voices filled the surroundings. I tuned my ears to the chatter.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s said that if you touch it just once, you won’t have any more wishes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t believe that. Probably just nonsense.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who are you to suspect anyone? You’re a guy who spends the whole day drinking.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, you brat? Want to die?”

 <p>
  “Come at me if you dare, you old fart. You’ve been bothering me for a while now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Most of the conversations were meaningless, but among them, there were repeated words.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Him.’
 </p>
 <p>
  They referred to someone with a pronoun, not a name.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed that ‘he’ was the reason so many people had gathered in the square.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s highly likely to be him.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In the middle of the square stood a grand and splendid building reminiscent of a castle.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that the Silver Hall?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It was about 20 meters tall, with white marble walls and stained glass windows that shimmered with iridescent colors. On the domed roof stood statues depicting twin goddesses. The walls were intricately carved with mysterious landscapes and patterns.

 <p>
  People’s attention was focused on the Silver Hall, particularly on one spot within it.
 </p>
 <p>
  A terrace stood 15 meters high.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Look, Oppa. Someone seems to be coming out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna pointed to the entrance of the terrace.
 </p>
 <p>
  And indeed, someone was coming out. It was an old man, dressed in a white priest’s robe. He glanced across the crowd and then tapped his staff on the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Everyone, be quiet!]
 </p>
 <p>
  A deep and authoritative voice spread across the entire square.
 </p>
 <p>
  The commotion that had been going on came to a sudden stop as people fell silent.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eolka murmured.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They’re using magic.”
 </p>

  [The successor of the Sun has arrived. Do not cause a disturbance!]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Time is being wasted.’
 </p>
 <p>
  We weren’t here for sightseeing.
 </p>
 <p>
  The countdown was still ticking down, little by little.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We will enter the temple.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Inside the temple?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t clear who we need to protect.
 </p>
 <p>
  There wasn’t enough information. But there was no time to hesitate. It was time to make a decision. If such an event occurred in the stage, it was highly likely that the guarded individual was a key figure in the event.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Decisions need to be made quickly.’

 <p>
  I turned my gaze to the entrance of the temple.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soldiers clad in armor were arranged beside the doorway with wings carved in relief. They were rigorously controlling who could enter. Suddenly, my eyes met with those of one soldier.
 </p>
 <p>
  I drew my sword from its scabbard.
 </p>
 <p>
  The soldier’s eyes widened in astonishment.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They can see us too.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With my sword outstretched, I approached the entrance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soldiers swarmed in. A man who seemed to be the leader stepped forward with a cautious expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you guys?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Step aside. Unless you want to get hurt.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The temple is off-limits! Are you heretics?”

  “Heretics?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right. We serve the goddess…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I knocked over the plaster statue of a goddess next to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  The statue’s waist snapped, and it shattered into pieces.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this what you call heresy?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You, you crazy bastard! Kill him!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Accompanied by sound effects, a warning window appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Warning!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Human Soldier Lv.13] X ?
 </p>
 <p>
  [Unknown Enemy Lv.???] X ?

  It was a combat message indicating the appearance of enemies.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So it’s the correct answer, huh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Phew, you. You’re really aggressive.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you guys also believers of some kind of goddess cult or something?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I only believe in myself. And Oppa.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron drew his spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna nocked an arrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll pierce through them and enter the temple. The target we’re guarding should be in there.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang!

 <p>
  The soldiers simultaneously drew their weapons. Swords, spears, and halberds.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Exterminate the heretics!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Following the orders of their leader, the soldiers rushed forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  I put on my shield with my left hand and spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Push through.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The soldier at the front swung his halberd.
 </p>
 <p>
  After deflecting it with my shield, I thrust my sword into his throat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Gah! Ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Amidst coughing up froth, the soldier behind him thrust his spear. As I turned my torso, the spear grazed the side of my leather armor. It bent, and my sword blade pierced through thin steel, cutting through flesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Gaaah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yaaah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Another soldier charged with a halberd in hand. I crouched down and used my shield to sweep him off his feet. He spun in the air and I waved my sword downward.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t engage them one by one. Run to the inside!”
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s no need to fight them all.
 </p>
 <p>
  I swept aside the soldier charging at me and started running, the other three followed my suit.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the people gathered in the square, some discovered the bodies.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh! What the… a person, a person is dead!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A high-pitched scream echoed through the square.
 </p>
 <p>
  We entered the stairs leading to the gate.
 </p>

  The leader swung his sword and shouted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Block them! Protect the temple from the heretics!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Splat!
 </p>
 <p>
  Thunk!
 </p>
 <p>
  An arrow pierced the leader’s forehead.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna shot arrows at the soldiers following us as she ran up the stairs. She aimed at their legs and arms. Soldiers hidden beside the stone pillars beside the stairs revealed themselves.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ignore them! We don’t have time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron thrust his spear into the soldier guarding the door.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  I kicked open the door that led to the temple’s interior.
 </p>

  Once I confirmed Eolka had entered as well, I closed the door behind her.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Eolka.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I know!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eolka quickly chanted a spell.
 </p>
 <p>
  A piece of wood from inside the temple rose by itself and got wedged between the door handles.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thump! Thump!
 </p>
 <p>
  Loud banging on the door echoed from outside.
 </p>
 <p>
  A middle-aged priest who had been reading a book on the altar opened his eyes wide.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wh-who are you people? How did you get here…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I quickly surveyed the interior.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were passages to the left and right.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seven soldiers holding weapons burst out from the passage on the right and drew their weapons.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who dares intrude here!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Clear them out and then follow me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What about you, Oppa?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll go first.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll catch up quickly.”

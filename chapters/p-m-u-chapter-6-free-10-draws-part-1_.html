 <p>
  When I woke up the next day, everything was the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Phew…”

 <p>
  I let out a sigh deep from within my chest.
 </p>
 <p>
  It had been quite a while since I quit smoking, but it was the first time I had such a strong desire to light up a cigarette since that time when my party on the 80th floor was wiped out, where I blew away all my money.
 </p>
 <p>
  Accepted it.
 </p>
 <p>
  No more childish antics. This place was the world of Pick Me Up, and I was summoned as a 1-star hero by birth.
 </p>
 <p>
  And I had pathetic stats compared to Shay.
 </p>
 <p>
  A Novice class with no basics whatsoever.
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t even have any skills. That was my current state.
 </p>
 <p>
  I washed my face in the bathroom and cooked instant ramen. The pot from yesterday was still there. I did the dishes while the water was boiling.
 </p>
 <p>
  As I scrubbed the pot with a soapy sponge, I pondered.
 </p>
 <p>
  What kind of game is Pick Me Up?
 </p>
 <p>
  If someone were to be summoned as a hero in Pick Me Up with the game rules applied, how could they survive?
 </p>
 <p>
  There are two ways for heroes to disappear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dying in battle or vanishing through synthesis.
 </p>
 <p>
  And I was a 1-star.
 </p>
 <p>
  What did it mean to be a 1-star hero in Pick Me Up?
 </p>
 <p>
  To most masters, a 1-star is expendable. And not just any expendable, but the lowest of the low. They have poor basic stats, and their growth rate is extremely low. On top of that, they get debuffed easily and their combat power decreases.
 </p>
 <p>
  The same situation applies in other mobile games.
 </p>
 <p>
  Characters obtained from free draws are treated the same way.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  I swallowed hard.
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, I found a piece of paper and a pen in my hand. It was something I found in the drawer next to the bed. I didn’t know why such things were in the room, but if I could use them, I would use them to the fullest.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Objective.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I scribbled the word on the paper.
 </p>
 <p>
  For now, this is my objective. There’s no need for a fancy objective. Just survive in this world.
 </p>
 <p>
  And I have to set specific goals.
 </p>
 <p>
  If something like this happened in another mobile game, I would have given up. The growth rate of the characters is predetermined, and their skills are fixed. No matter how hard I tried, I wouldn’t be able to break free from my fate.
 </p>
 <p>
  But Pick Me Up is different.
 </p>
 <p>
  Depending on the nurturing method and the hero’s personal abilities, even a 1-star by birth can become a hero that surpasses a 5-star.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s because of the unique potential assigned to each hero. In addition to the visible status window, there are other abilities that exist. They are not displayed as numerical values and must be grasped by the master while observing battles.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  Even if they start with the same star and abilities, completely different heroes are born.
 </p>
 <p>
  Therefore, to become a master of Pick Me Up, you needed a “discerning eye” to choose the “promising saplings.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The pen continued to write.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Goal. Become stronger.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I have to become stronger.
 </p>
 <p>
  Survival, revenge, and returning are all impossible if I don’t become strong.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s not just physical strength. I have to change mentally as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  I can’t survive with the same indifferent mindset I had on Earth.
 </p>
 <p>
  I don’t know how things will unfold from here on. If I continue to be surprised and act haphazardly like yesterday, will I be able to survive?
 </p>
 <p>
  “No.”

 <p>
  If I can’t adapt, I’ll die.
 </p>
 <p>
  If I can’t change, I’ll be devoured.
 </p>
 <p>
  I have experienced such situations before.
 </p>
 <p>
  I may be just an ordinary young man like anyone elses, but it was different in the past.
 </p>
 <p>
  During my childhood, I remembered the annoyed gaze of the orphanage director when he looked at me. At that time, I had nothing. No parents, relatives, or friends. Everyone was an enemy, and I was alone.
 </p>
 <p>
  I climbed up from the bottom. I treated life like a battle just to live the same life as others.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s okay.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I’m used to irrationality.
 </p>
 <p>
  The important thing is to calmly assess the situation and accept it.
 </p>
 <p>
  The absurd fact that I have fallen into the world of the game I used to enjoy.

 <p>
  In this situation, I can’t trust anyone.
 </p>
 <p>
  The only one I can trust is myself.
 </p>
 <p>
  After eating the ramen, I headed to the square.
 </p>
 <p>
  The square was still empty.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Iselle, are you there?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I shouted.
 </p>
 <p>
  After a while, a small fairy appeared in the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ah, why are you calling me again! I’m busy, you know!]
 </p>
 <p>
  She said while complaining, but she still showed up.
 </p>
 <p>
  [No matter how much you ask, I won’t tell you anything. If you’re curious, climb the tower. The answers are there at the top. Well, of course, a trashy 1-star like you won’t make it to the top. Kyahaha!]

 <p>
  Iselle laughed, clutching her stomach.
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t get angry. After I’ve finally cleared my mind today, I’ve noticed this little one’s level.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Iselle Lv.257]
 </p>
 <p>
  At level 257, she’s at the level of a late-game boss on the 80th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have a question.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I won’t tell you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this status window only visible to me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Status window?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle fluttered her wings and circled around in the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The level 257 floating above your head.”

 <p>
  [Ha, you can see it too? It’s not even a public information. Annoying, so annoying.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Her reaction confirms it.
 </p>
 <p>
  The game’s messages are visible only to “me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Maybe because our worlds got mixed up? Anyway, that person did something really annoying… Mom! What am I saying! I shouldn’t say this!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle looked around and then quickly fled.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our worlds got mixed up? It doesn’t matter.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Equipment window!”

 <p>
  [Armor: None]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Accessory: None]
 </p>
 <p>
  As expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  The iron sword I used in the tutorial was a supply item automatically given to heroes without weapons. Shay, being a 4-star, had a basic weapon and armor.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I clenched my fist.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though I’m a 1-star, I obtained a special ability that others don’t have. I can observe my own status from the perspective of the master. It will be a great help in the path ahead.
 </p>
 <p>
  I won’t be defeated. Absolutely.
 </p>
 <p>
  I made up my mind once again.
 </p>
 <p>
  But…
 </p>
 <p>
  What if the master stops loging in like this?
 </p>
 <p>
  “….”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yesterday’s incident was no ordinary mistake.
 </p>
 <p>
  He synthesized a 4-star with a 1-star. The probability of getting a 4-star from a paid summon is about 1%.
 </p>
 <p>
  That poor bastard threw it away with one control mistake, which comes once in a hundred tries.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since Pick Me Up is linked to the phone, restarting was impossible.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t dwell on negative thoughts.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I can think about that when the time comes.
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s no need to waste mental strength on an unexpected event.
 </p>
 <p>
  I immediately locked myself in the room and started scribbling on paper. There were notebooks and pens overflowing in the drawer. If I thought I needed something, it would appear even if it wasn’t there before.

  A week passed like that.

  A cheerful sound accompanied the hologram window that appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  I jumped up from my chair.

 <p>
  Notices and ongoing events were listed one after another.
 </p>
 <p>
  I knew most of the events by heart, but there were some that I didn’t remember.
 </p>
 <p>
  The notices were quickly skipped.
 </p>
 <p>
  During the tutorial, I was too busy to read them, but now it’s different. I need to know what kind of player the master is to develop a survival strategy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether they are a free-to-play user or a paying user.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether they are a casual player or a hardcore player.
 </p>
 <p>
  I focused on the system messages.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master, please check your tutorial rewards!”

  “Not buying it, huh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At least for now, he might be a free-to-play user.
 </p>
 <p>
  he might still be considering the budget.
 </p>
 <p>
  It would have been great if I could see the actual game screen, not just the system messages, but unfortunately, that feature wasn’t provided.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, what is going to do?
 </p>
 <p>
  In the current situation, I’m the only hero. In that case, the master’s task in this situation is undoubtedly…

  Infinite heroes, my ass.

  If my hypothesis is correct, the Mobius Sermon and the unique artificial intelligence of the heroes are all fake. I could only realize that after actually falling into the game.

  As expected, Anytng touched the summoning altar.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was only natural. Unless you’re a lunatic, you can’t progress through stages with just one 1-star hero.
 </p>
 <p>
  The top is the “Paid Summon” using Gems, and the bottom is the “Free Summon” using Gold.
 </p>
 <p>
  Antng chose the “Free Summon.”

  A total of ten messages appeared. The summoning was over.
 </p>
 <p>
  I started counting numbers slowly in my mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  From one to a hundred. While counting the numbers, I calmed my mind. No matter what happens outside, I won’t get excited. I won’t panic.
 </p>
 <p>
  After finishing counting, I went to the square.

  The summoning altar was open, and ten people, men and women, were gathered near the entrance of the summoning altar.
 </p>
 <p>
  They huddled together in a corner of the square, looking bewildered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where is this? Is this a dream?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, we were just during harvest season!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did we get dragged here by a magician? Are we going to turn into experimental tools…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stop talking nonsense!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Although they differed in age, gender, and appearance, they had a few things in common.
 </p>
 <p>
  First, they had the same race. Probably of Caucasian descent.
 </p>
 <p>
  Second, they spoke the same language. It wasn’t Japanese or Chinese. It wasn’t Spanish or French either. It was a language similar to English but with a different feel, and I could understand its content. I might even be able to speak it.
 </p>
 <p>
  And lastly, the third thing,

  They were all humans.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, it’s fate that we’ve met like this. Let’s introduce ourselves first.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A middle-aged man with a well-groomed beard stepped forward. He was wearing a leather tunic and worn-out pants.
 </p>
 <p>
  He gestured to me, who was standing a little far away.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come over here too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I walked through the crowd.
 </p>
 <p>
  A redhead girl with long hair pointed at the summoning altar’s door and shouted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This brother, he came from the other door, not from that door! He’s different from us! He might know something.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that true?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, I saw it.”

  She’s mischievous.

  I said,

 <p>
  “I’m the same as you. I came from that door.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The people immediately started whispering among themselves.

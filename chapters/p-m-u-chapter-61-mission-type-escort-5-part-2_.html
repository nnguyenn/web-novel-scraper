 <p>
  There was a sound of fabric rustling. Then, a hint of sobbing mixed in.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is she crying?’

 <p>
  Even if it’s just in name, she’s a princess.
 </p>
 <p>
  At most, she’s in her mid-teens. It wouldn’t be easy to accept that she’s suddenly under the threat of assassination.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I returned to the living room, Priasis handed me the dress and crown with an indifferent expression. I received the dress and the crown.
 </p>
 <p>
  I went outside to avoid triggering any traps and tossed them into the trash bin.
 </p>
 <p>
  I returned to the living room.
 </p>
 <p>
  The princess was touching her old skirt.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The texture is strange.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s strange indeed. Insects were laying eggs in it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m joking.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t make jokes like that!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I grinned and patted Priasis.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although she still stood out due to her silver hair, things improved a bit. Her stature was small, so as long as she concealed her body properly, she wouldn’t be easily noticed. I sat down on a chair in the living room and spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll depart in two or three hours. Get some rest.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What about food…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you hungry? There’s nothing to eat.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood. I’ll rest a little.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis leaned against the wall again and settled down.
 </p>

 <p>
  Then, she began to doze off. She looked tired.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked out the window.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sky had darkened. There was barely any moonlight, and both inside and outside the house were pitch black. It didn’t hinder my vision much. It was thanks to my Awakened skill, “Inner Sight,” that I acquired before coming to this place. Even in darkness, I could discern the outlines of objects.
 </p>
 <p>
  And when the house was completely dark, Edis returned.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing Priasis sleeping soundly, Edis chuckled briefly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis could also see objects in the dark, just like I could.
 </p>
 <p>
  “She’s sleeping well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The exit?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I found it. There’s a bit of a problem, though.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis started explaining what she saw and heard.
 </p>

 <p>
  We couldn’t go beyond the predetermined route. Although she tried to go outside through a gap in the collapsed city wall, an invisible barrier blocked her, making it impossible.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Tricks won’t work, huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems we can only go through the main gate.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The main gate is likely heavily guarded.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The situation was getting annoying.
 </p>
 <p>
  If there was time, we would have explored further, but I couldn’t guarantee how long Aaron could hold out. There was also the possibility that the soldiers would start searching the area. We had to escape the city by the end of this dawn at most.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It can’t be helped.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t delay this any longer.
 </p>
 <p>
  I pushed the chair and woke up Priasis.
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis woke up quickly.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Get up. We’re moving now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s going to be quite dark outside. Stick close behind me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis nodded her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  The three of us left the house together. The streets were engulfed in darkness. Even with my Awakened Sight, if I didn’t concentrate, I could easily lose my sense of direction. Torches moved in various places. Edis whispered in a low voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Those are patrolling soldiers.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They’re very visible.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As long as we avoided the torches, we wouldn’t run into the soldiers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Following Edis’s guidance, we walked through several alleys and finally emerged onto a main road. I hid in the shadows of a building, keeping my upper body low as I looked ahead.
 </p>
 <p>
  Torches were gathered in the distance, and the yellow light from the torches illuminated the surroundings.
 </p>

 <p>
  The city gate was revealed.
 </p>
 <p>
  I quickly counted the number of enemies standing near the gate.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Human Soldier Lv. 11] x 21
 </p>
 <p>
  [Human Knight Lv. 21]
 </p>
 <p>
  As I recognized them, a message appeared, indicating the appearance of the enemies.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There’s quite a crowd.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In total, twenty-two.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was too many for just the two of us to handle. Moreover, there was a knight in black armor standing in front of the gate. His level was suspiciously high. If he was level 21, he was at least five levels higher than the knights I had faced before.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Should we try another city gate?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a waste of time. They’ll probably be similar.”
 </p>

 <p>
  There weren’t many exits.
 </p>
 <p>
  And there would be enemies guarding each exit like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  If I were alone, I could break through somehow, but there was a VIP to protect behind me. She had to go out of the gate to achieve the mission success condition.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Did I make the wrong choice?’
 </p>
 <p>
  If I had abandoned Aaron and forcefully exited through a break-in, the mission would have been much easier to accomplish.
 </p>
 <p>
  I scratched my head nervously. There was no turning back now. I had to play the best move from the cards I had.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Edis, do you know Aaron’s party’s location?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, not that far.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ve understood the city’s layout, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis nodded.
 </p>

 <p>
  Geography is the basis of information gathering. Edis must have analyzed the city’s structure before finding the exit. Otherwise, she wouldn’t be able to provide accurate guidance.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s one thing I need you to do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sure.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Go back to the house where we were. In the trash bin next to it, there’s the dress and crown of the kid. Take those clothes and join Aaron’s group. Dress Jenna in them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “… Are you serious?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re going to use her as bait.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It was deep into the night.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna and Priasis had similar builds. If I put the clothes on her, unless someone examined her up close, it would be hard to tell them apart.
 </p>
 <p>
  “When Jenna wears the clothes, cause as much chaos as possible within the bounds of not getting caught. Most of the enemy forces over there should be drawn away. In the meantime, I’ll take the kid and clear a path.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>

 <p>
  “The city might be vast, but there are limited places to hide. Can you do it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  After a brief hesitation, Edis nodded and disappeared to where we came from.
 </p>
 <p>
  I placed the shield in a corner of the building and unsheathed my sword from its scabbard. The metal shield had a chance of reflecting light.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Aaron (★★)’ has been inflicted with ‘Poison’ status. Health will decrease at regular intervals.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hero’s poisoning is worsening!]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Phew.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The time he could manage with a potion seemed to be reaching its limit.
 </p>
 <p>
  Drawing the enemy’s attention and protecting Aaron. It was a bit challenging, but I had no choice but to believe in them.
 </p>
 <p>
  At most, it would be an hour.
 </p>
 <p>
  Within that time frame, this would be over.

 <p>
  The next morning.
 </p>
 <p>
  I instructed the members gathered at the training grounds to engage in self-training.
 </p>

 <p>
  Until now, we had followed a semi-compulsory training schedule, so this was essentially a declaration of vacation. It would last for three days. Anytng would probably also refrain from sending us into battle during this time.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is it for real? You’re not going to just feed us potatoes because we’re not training, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I told you that’s not it. Have I been lying to you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eolka cheered in delight before immediately dashing out of the training grounds.
 </p>
 <p>
  I knew where she was headed. Straight to her room. There, she had various precious items she had earned by doing her research.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What about you guys?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll take a bit of a break. It’s become a habit. We’re planning to rest only until the evening.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna tied a sandbag to each ankle and started stretching.
 </p>
 <p>
  She was getting ready for track running. Aaron was also toning his body beside her.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re doing it. Even if I tell you not to.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re the same, oppa.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ironically, I also had a sandbag tied to my ankles.
 </p>
 <p>
  It weighed about 10kg. It was more like a lump of iron than a sandbag.
 </p>
 <p>
  Without doing this much, it would be impossible to consume my stamina. I could do hundreds of push-ups in the correct posture, run 100m in around 8 seconds, and even break tree trunks with my bare hands. My body had already reached the limits of human potential.
 </p>
 <p>
  Interference energy.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the source that granted the power to transcend humans to heroes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle had explained it that way. It was truly an inexplicable phenomenon if not for interference. In less than half a year, I had become a monster that was half outside the realm of humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Running along the track, I looked around the training grounds.
 </p>

 <p>
  The heroes in training were Roderick, Asher, and Dica from the 2nd party, along with Velkist and Neryssa. They were both promising members of the 3rd party, which had rapidly risen from the 2-star tier. The chances were high that one of them would join our party.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, we had 3 members in the 1st party, 3 in the 2nd party, and 2 in the 3rd party.
 </p>
 <p>
  A total of 8 members. That was the extent of the training ground’s members.
 </p>
 <p>
  I glanced at the plaza beyond the open door.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were numerous people resting near the fountain.
 </p>
 <p>
  Approximately dozens of them. They chatted with each other while sitting on benches or taking walks. There were no noticeable shadows on their faces.
 </p>
 <p>
  These were the lower-tier heroes who had been summoned after I handed over the strategy book to Anytng.
 </p>
 <p>
  Initially, they had been eager to improve, but over time, they had started to slack off. They hardly had any time at the training grounds and were also lacking in learning supplemental skills.
 </p>
 <p>
  The reason was simple.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng didn’t synthesize anyone.
 </p>

 <p>
  They didn’t need to compete with each other, and they spent most of their time resting.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Phew!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist spat.
 </p>
 <p>
  One of his eyes with a scar twisted in discomfort.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was also from the 2nd generation, but he was a variant. Even though he hadn’t undergone synthesis, he voluntarily engaged in training. His training intensity was comparable to Aaron’s. His talent was also excellent.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, he had a slight personality issue.
 </p>
 <p>
  After completing three laps around the track, a loud laughter echoed from the plaza.
 </p>
 <p>
  Someone had cracked a funny joke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “… Huh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist chuckled.
 </p>

 <p>
  Then he mumbled softly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “When I came to the waiting room for the first time, I heard an interesting story.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I stopped in my tracks.
 </p>
 <p>
  The other members also paused momentarily.
 </p>
 <p>
  With all eyes on him, Velkist continued speaking.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It doesn’t matter who you were before coming here. Whether noble or trash. If you want to live, prove your usefulness. Show your own worth.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist looked at me with a twisted smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  Was this about the time I subdued the Fangwolf mercenary party?
 </p>
 <p>
  I had said something similar. But, this guy was referring to something that had happened long before he arrived.
 </p>
 <p>
  “When someone told me those words, I got excited. It’s a place where anything is possible as long as I prove my worth. Knowing this, even fighting for my life was enjoyable.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The laughter of those bastards who are worse than pigs outside can be heard here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Pigs, huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dica grimaced.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Worse than pigs, indeed. They only know how to eat and do nothing else. Isn’t that right, seniors?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist pulled out his sword halfway from its sheath.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I heard about the hardships the seniors went through. It must have been very thrilling. It’s a pity that I came late. But isn’t this a different story?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sheeth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist pulled the sword completely out of the scabbard.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then he licked the blade with his tongue. A murderous glint shone in his eyes.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-6" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 </div>
 <p>
  “If the seniors allow, could I do a bit of educating? Would that be okay?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist had outstanding talent and enthusiasm, but there was this kind of issue.
 </p>
 <p>
  I frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t go out of your way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t it okay as long as I don’t kill them?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I drew my sword without saying anything.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist laughed heartily and sheathed his sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m too scared to continue. Sorry for being bold. But you have to give me an answer. Was what the senior said just a lie?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Prove your worth, is that what you mean?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems to me that it doesn’t matter whether I prove my worth or not. I heard that there was a very good system called synthesis to dispose of trash, but strangely, the Master doesn’t seem to use it.”
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-7" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  ‘Don’t use synthesis recklessly.’
 </p>
 <p>
  That was one of the fundamental principles of Niflheimr.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I posted the strategy, many Masters followed this principle.
 </p>
 <p>
  But they all failed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fear was one of the most powerful motivators for heroes’ actions.
 </p>
 <p>
  If there was no fear of synthesis, heroes wouldn’t listen to the Master’s words. They would act lazy, move on their own, and often refuse orders. The current situation, with a very limited number of active people compared to the number of heroes, had similar causes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do your tasks. You’ll understand the meaning of my words soon enough.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll be watching. I’m looking forward to it.”

 <p>
  Velkist returned to a corner of the training ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  And he started training again.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sheathed my sword and looked outside.
 </p>
 <p>
  People in the plaza were still laughing and chatting.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That’s if he had seen that document.’
 </p>
 <p>
  My play record that I had handed over to Anytng.
 </p>
 <p>
  It contained my thoughts on this phenomenon.

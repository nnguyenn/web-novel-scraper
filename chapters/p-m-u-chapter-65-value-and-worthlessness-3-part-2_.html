  [What the hell are you doing?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “As long as you don’t kill him, it’s okay, right?”

 <p>
  Velkist looked at the man writhing on the ground under his feet and said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stick your arm back on yourself. If you press it against the cross-section, it should stick by itself. But again, I’ve never tried cutting myself, so I wouldn’t know.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The plaza froze for a moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  Blood flowed from the sword Velkist held in his right hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I came back after a round of beating, and there’s an interesting scene happening. I like it a lot. My hands are itching, are there any more brats like him?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You lunatic!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Someone hidden in the crowd shouted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s better than being a damn pig. Don’t you think so, senior?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist looked at me and smirked.
 </p>
 <p>
  I frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who the hell do you think you are to step forward?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I apologize. It was so disgusting that my hand moved without my knowing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist wiped off the blood and put the sword back in its sheath.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then he went to the wall in a corner of the plaza and leaned against it.
 </p>
 <p>
  The man was crawling toward his severed arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He got lucky.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If Velkist hadn’t stepped in, Iselle’s hand would have crushed his skull.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle soared into the air, then turned her gaze to the 3rd party that had just joined the plaza.

 <p>
  [So did you hear the news?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You mean the division of the 1st and 2nd floors? The 1st floor is crawling in the mud, and the 2nd floor is treated well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [In short, that’s right. And you guys are on the 1st floor too.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry. We’ll be up soon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist pointed at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa was standing beside him with her eyes closed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I’ll summarize it again for the idiots who couldn’t understand. Among the total of 35 members, 13 are on the 2nd floor. The remaining 22 are on the 1st floor. The 2nd-floor folks have freedom. You can use all the facilities in the waiting room. But not the 1st-floor folks. If you go up to the 2nd floor and get caught, I might kill you!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle clenched her fist threateningly.
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you want to go to the 2nd floor, improve your abilities. Everyone, pay attention. We have a perfect example right here!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle pointed at me and stuck her nose up.

 <p>
  [Follow the example of the super ace who can do anything, Han! Have you seen how we did on the 15th floor? Did you see it? You guys can’t even imagine. Truly ingenious tactics and… Aw, aw, hehehe!]
 </p>
 <p>
  I pulled Iselle’s cheek.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the attention was focused on me.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Did I end up with another tiring role?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I had said something similar before.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took a deep breath and spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you want to be treated like a human being, you have to show your abilities. Whether it’s in battle or whatever. The Master is watching you. If he deems it sufficient, even if you dislike it, he’ll send you to the 2nd floor.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even so, isn’t this going too far? We were brought here without knowing anything. And now we’re being forced into this kind of life.”
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the guys burst into tears.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist detached himself from the wall. His right hand was on his sheath.
 </p>

 <p>
  I spoke in a chilly voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t you dare take a move.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist returned to his spot in silence.
 </p>
 <p>
  I continued speaking.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re the same as you. We were dragged here without warning. No, it was even more cruel than that. Isn’t that right, Jenna?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, that’s true. We didn’t even have anything to eat. We would have ended up synthesized right away if we made a small mistake.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We trained all day like idiots. And it’s all coming back now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Does that mean… you’re telling us to fight alongside you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s how it’s going to be.”
 </p>
 <p>
  We didn’t really need many support or collection roles yet.

 <p>
  Most of them would become combatant heroes, and among them, a handful of talented individuals would be able to go to the 2nd floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  The guy lowered his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘One side accepts, and the other side doesn’t. It’s half and half.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Some people appeared deep in thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were also people going down to the 1st floor with a sense of resignation.
 </p>
 <p>
  But there were also those who clearly showed their dissatisfaction.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a simple psychological response.
 </p>
 <p>
  Given and then taken away. They had their enjoyment snatched away in an instant. They were bound to be resentful. This part was a mistake by Anytng.
 </p>
 <p>
  To easily transition the system, the timing of free draws should have been delayed, or the steps should have been gradually implemented. To put it simply, the new system was established firmly but also quickly, and hasty changes can cause a backlash.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nonsense!”

 <p>
  Like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  A pleasantly chubby middle-aged man wiped his forehead and spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We won’t accept this. Being treated like trash and being told to go fight? Where’s the logic in this!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You bastards didn’t follow orders even when you were well-fed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist sneered.
 </p>
 <p>
  The man didn’t back down and shouted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t that right, comrades?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. We will reclaim our rightful rights!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Nearly ten people instantly gathered together.
 </p>
 <p>
  The chubby guy smiled with satisfaction.
 </p>

  “Did you think we wouldn’t know about the secret you’ve been hiding?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Secret?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The way to force the Master to change his will. We know how can let this little monster touch us. You might have tried to hide it, but we’ve all found out. So? If we want to be treated like human beings, why do we have to risk our lives fighting monsters? Isn’t this madness?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Exactly!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “From now on, we declare our refusal to participate!”
 </p>
 <p>
  People centered around the chubby guy, raised their fists.
 </p>
 <p>
  With sound effects, the system message was updated.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Sitan (★)’ has refused to deploy!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘4th Party’ is inoperable.]
 </p>

 <p>
  [Massive protest situation!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Heroes are causing a riot!]
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Messing around without understanding the true meaning of this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I took out my sword from my belt and placed it below my feet.
 </p>
 <p>
  I pushed down with my foot, and the sword spun on the plaza floor and slid towards the group.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Cut off one of your arms with that sword. Just like that guy. Then I’ll spare you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I pointed to the man who was desperately trying to reattach his severed arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  The chubby man spoke as if he was looking at a madman.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha, have you gone crazy?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can’t help you if you don’t listen to my words! Consider it a cheap education fee.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Master, synthesis is starting!’]
 </p>
 <p>
  Clunk.
 </p>
 <p>
  The door of the Synthesis Hall opened.

  Plaza, many people remained.
 </p>
 <p>
  They alternated their gaze between us and those who declared a strike on the other side. There was a sense of curiosity and intrigue in their looks.

 <p>
  They must be wondering.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether their methods will work.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it works, they will make the same choice.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehe, did you think you could just hide it to yourself? We know everything too. We can refuse the Master’s orders!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That insolent fairy can’t touch us either! How about that, surprised?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The chubby man laughed sinisterly. His companion snickered beside him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Joy could be seen in their faces.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s definitely not wrong.
 </p>
 <p>
  Heroes have the right to refuse the Master’s orders.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unless Iselle had a special reason, she couldn’t touch a hero.
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis said with a firm expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stop it. We risked our lives. What you’re doing now is different.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s different? We’re also risking our lives!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you don’t even understand the meaning of those words…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I stepped forward and restrained Edis.
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis frowned, clutched her forehead, bit her tongue, and withdrew.
 </p>
 <p>
  They thought they had won and laughed louder. I said,

  “Good attitude. Then go risk your lives directly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [We were planning to do that anyway! Velkist, Alan, Leslie!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle spun around and pointed to the left door of the plaza.
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the synthesis chamber, a purple magic circle emitted an eerie light.
 </p>
 <p>
  [These three. Go through that door, execute!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is it synthesis?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist smiled without saying a word and moved into the synthesis chamber.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle looked at the two who were looking at her with puzzled eyes.

  [Why aren’t you going in quickly? We don’t have time.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, what’s this…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t help but chuckle.
 </p>
 <p>
  Knowing about the strike but not about the synthesis.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had heard the story, but he had undoubtedly only half-listened.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Fine, if you won’t go by yourself I’ll send you in!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle grabbed the edges of their clothes and threw them.
 </p>
 <p>
  The movement was light, but the force behind it was not. The two men shot towards the synthesis chamber like projectiles and collided with the inner wall. One of them hit his head on the wall, blood dripping from his forehead.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait a moment! Wait…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang!

  The synthesis chamber door closed with a loud noise.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you really want to synthesize?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes (selected) / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  A flash from the synthesis spilled through the closed-door crack.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Synthesis complete!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Alan (★)’ has turned into light and disappeared.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Leslie (★)’ has turned into light and disappeared.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Velkist (★★)’, leveled up! Acquired ‘Wild’ skill!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The chubby man, Sitan, stared at the synthesis chamber door with a dazed look.
 </p>
 <p>
  After a while, the door opened and Velkist emerged.

 <p>
  “This kills the mood!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist twisted his lips as if they could touch his ears.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fangs were visible between his lips. Velquist, now level 8, looked at the remaining strike group and said in a low voice,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not enough. Are there no more? There still seem to be plenty of offerings.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That should be enough after eating that much. Your turn is over now.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s too bad.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist giggled and then sat down next to the synthesis chamber, his rear against it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “In any case, it was a good experience. I hope we do it more often.”
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no trace of hesitation in his expression. Instead, he seemed pleased. He didn’t appear worried at all that he would be the target of synthesis.

  [Neryssa, Oliver, Walter!]

 <p>
  Iselle called the next three.
 </p>
 <p>
  Three again this time. One target and two offerings.
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa entered the synthesis chamber with calm steps. The man who was called screamed and grabbed Sitan’s collar.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Damn it, what you told us is different! You said nothing would happen!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s not true. From what I heard, it’s okay!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then why aren’t the two guys who went in earlier coming out?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Iselle approached, the man sat on the ground and clapped his hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait. I was fooled by this guy. Fooled! I didn’t expect it to turn out like this. Seriously!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [So what?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle said in an annoyed tone and threw the man away.
 </p>

 <p>
  The man resisted, twisting his body, but it was in vain. Another man who had been running up the stairs was soon caught by Iselle and thrust into the synthesis chamber.
 </p>
 <p>
  The door closed behind them.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Are you really going to synthesize?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes (selected) / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  A flash from the synthesis spilled out through the closed-door crack.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Synthesis complete!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Walter (★)’ has turned into light and disappeared.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Oliver (★)’ has turned into light and disappeared.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Four sacrifices. Six survivors remained.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sitan hurriedly spoke.
 </p>

 <p>
  “I’ll lift the refusal to participate!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘4-party’ is now operable.]
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no message indicating the release of the 5-party.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because they had all been wiped out.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Jenna, Lawrence!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “In the end, it turned out like this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna entered the synthesis chamber with an annoyed expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the deployment refusal was lifted, the synthesis didn’t stop. Lawrence knelt down and begged.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Save me. Please save me! He came up with the idea! Just kill him!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Goodbye.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle grabbed Lawrence’s hand and threw him into the synthesis chamber.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, the deployment refusal is lifted. Why isn’t it stopping?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sitan yelled, sweating profusely.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Of course.’
 </p>
 <p>
  They were the examples.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the current method was more moderate than an operation focused solely on synthesis, it still required fear.
 </p>
 <p>
  The people gathered in the plaza looked at the sacrifices with fearful eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were relieved that they weren’t included. Complaints about uncomfortable living conditions and meals were clearly evident.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Edis, Ridel!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The number of offerings decreased one by one.

 <p>
  Two for the less developed Velkist and Nerisa.
 </p>
 <p>
  One each for the relatively established members.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some tried to swing their fists, run away, or rampage, but it was futile. They had never properly cultivated their abilities in the first place. Their rebellion was feeble.
 </p>
 <p>
  “H-Hey. Say something at least!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A man clung to my feet.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you want me to say?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I heard you can converse with the Master. Tell him to stop this madness!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A light spilled out from the synthesis chamber door.
 </p>
 <p>
  I pointed my sword at Sitan’s feet. No one paid any attention to the sword I had pushed forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Cut off one of your arms with this sword. Then I’ll tell the Master.”

 <p>
  I pointed my sword at Sitan’s feet. No one paid any attention to the sword I had pushed forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Cut off one of your arms with this sword. Then I’ll tell the Master.”

 <p>
  “What?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Didn’t I tell you earlier? It’s a cheap education fee.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As such, I could request a cease-fire from Anytng.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, I didn’t feel the need.
 </p>
 <p>
  The man’s mouth hung open in astonishment.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you insane! Cut off my own arm?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But…”
 </p>
 <p>
  They had already caused trouble. They couldn’t just pass it off for free, even for the future.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, if there was someone mad enough to cut off their own arm, it would be better to keep them alive and nurture them instead of synthesizing them. Of course, cutting off one’s own body parts was not an easy task.
 </p>
 <p>
  A man seemed to make up his mind and was about to cut off his arm when he screamed and threw the sword. A single line of blood appeared on his forearm. The man sobbed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t this too much… It’s not even a finger, it’s an arm!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Didn’t you say you’d risk your life?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “C-can you cut it for me? I can’t do it alone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can’t do that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you telling all of us to die?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That wouldn’t be so bad.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A few others tried to cut off their arms, but no one succeeded.
 </p>
 <p>
  To cut off an arm in one clean stroke, you needed swordsmanship skills or a high-strength stat. Otherwise, you would only saw it. However, in my eyes, there was no one mad enough for that. They repeated attempts and gave up, becoming offerings for synthesis.

 <p>
  Only one person remained.
 </p>
 <p>
  The instigator of this incident.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Han, Sitan!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I know.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I entered the synthesis chamber.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the waiting room became the second floor, the structure of the synthesis chamber changed as well. On the first floor was the promotion chamber, and on the second floor was the synthesis chamber. After a while, Sitan was reluctantly dragged into the synthesis chamber with vacant eyes. As the door closed, the magic circle began to glow.
 </p>
 <p>
  “W-What will happen to me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry. It won’t hurt.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re just…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sitan, who was about to continue speaking, disintegrated into particles of light in all directions.

 <p>
  Particles of light seeped into my body. Along with it, a message appeared indicating the completion of synthesis.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Synthesis complete!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Satan (★)’ has turned into light and disappeared.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★★)’, gained experience points!]
 </p>
 <p>
  A faint weak energy circulated throughout my body.
 </p>
 <p>
  The level difference between the target and the offering was significant.
 </p>
 <p>
  I only gained a certain amount of experience points; my level didn’t increase.
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon leaving the synthesis chamber, there were fewer than thirty people gathered, reduced by nearly half. With ten people dying due to synthesis, it was only natural. I attached the fallen sword to my belt.
 </p>
 <p>
  I surveyed the plaza.
 </p>
 <p>
  People’s expressions were frozen. Even if I hadn’t explained the synthesis process, they would have understood that they could never return.

 <p>
  ‘Next time study a bit more.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The participation refusal was a risky method even for me.
 </p>
 <p>
  For them, who were merely common 1-star heroes of the free summons, ending up like this was a foregone conclusion. It was the result of accepting only the information that pleased them without properly understanding the cause and effect.
 </p>
 <p>
  In any case, they had become good teaching materials.
 </p>
 <p>
  The survivors must have realized that there was an absolute power gap between the Master and the heroes. The refusal right was only in name; in reality, it was close to suicide.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This makes it 25 people.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I passed through the center of the plaza.
 </p>
 <p>
  The event was over. I intended to inspect the facilities. The accommodations and training center were now at level 3, and a bathhouse and lounge had been added. People cleared the path for me as I walked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You, you guys are crazy! Monsters!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I stopped walking.

 <p>
  The person shouting was hidden within the crowd, and their face wasn’t visible.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who said that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist stood up from his seat.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sword was already halfway out of its sheath.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stop.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The prototype isn’t over yet, is it? Seems like there’s a brat who’s only all talk left.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m fine, so why are you making a fuss?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Senior must be feeling at ease. If it were me, I’d completely crush him.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A smirk formed on Velkist’s lips.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You go first. I’ll see you on the second floor.”
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-6" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  Velkist descended to the first floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  His steps headed straight for the training center. He seemed to be testing the stats and skills he gained through synthesis. Others began to move as well. Soon, the heroes in the waiting room divided into those going up and down.
 </p>
 <p>
  The valuable ones,
 </p>
 <p>
  And the worthless ones.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master, starting a 10-consecutive summon. I’m looking forward to which heroes will come out!”
 </p>
 <p>
  And a message notifying the summon appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  *Ta-kak, du-roo-roo-roo.*
 </p>
 <p>
  *Follow-ran!*
 </p>
 <p>
  *Common!*
 </p>
 <p>
  *Master ‘Anytng’…*

 <p>
  I looked down at the first floor through the transparent floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  The summoning portal on the first floor opened. A white light was seeping out from the door. He was filling the numbers after consuming heroes through mass synthesis.
 </p>
 <p>
  From now on, the location of summoning would differ according to the grade.
 </p>
 <p>
  Free summons’ heroes were on the first floor. Paid summons started from the second floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  A man who had just been summoned stepped onto the plaza.
 </p>
 <p>
  His face had the bewildered expression unique to 1-star heroes. A girl followed behind the man. It seemed like she was yelling something, but I couldn’t hear the sound.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thunk.
 </p>
 <p>
  The rift of time and space opened.
 </p>
 <p>
  Purging. At least two would die here.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed that job assignments would be given after the purging. Iselle appeared and herded them into the rift. Only a few of them would be able to make it to the second floor.
 </p>

 <p>
  ‘Did he say I was crazy?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled.
 </p>
 <p>
  Common sense of reality does not work here.
 </p>
 <p>
  We consume each other through synthesis and fight for our lives against monsters that try to kill us. If adapting to those laws means being crazy, then that’s what we’ve become.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you feel so attached to the first floor. You can always come down.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna laughed, scratching her cheek.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron looked up at the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The fact that the second floor has been established means that the third floor will be established too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The number of floors will increase.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Grades will be differentiated there too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis said.
 </p>
 <p>
  I nodded my head. The current waiting room was divided into upper and lower levels, but eventually, it would become a pyramid structure. Like Niflheimr. Although that place used a much more advanced system than here, the core was similar.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the door on the front of the second-floor plaza.
 </p>
 <p>
  A plaque with the words “Rift of Time and Space” written on it was firmly attached to the closed door.
 </p>
 <p>
  I headed towards my lodge.

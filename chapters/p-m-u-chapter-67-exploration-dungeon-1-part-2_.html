  “It won’t be a new floor. One person is missing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I said.

 <p>
  The last members of Party 1 and Party 2 hadn’t been filled yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  The circumstances were different from the 15th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why did they call us then? Usually, they don’t call you for the weekly dungeon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master ordered an expedition.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Expedition?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna raised an eyebrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘An expedition.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Main dungeon, weekly dungeon, and finally, the exploration dungeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a three-pronged content that was permanently open in the rift of time and space. The exploration dungeon had opened when we cleared the 10th floor, but it seemed that we were finally sending a party now that we had passed the 15th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Go already. I’ve opened the rift. I’m so busy I don’t even have time to rest.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle puffed out her cheeks and scattered stardust before disappearing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then she reappeared on the first floor and called out the members of the other party. Her shouting voice sounded irritated. It seemed like excessive work had led to some discontent.
 </p>
 <p>
  I headed toward the stairs to the lower floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna pointed at the rift of the second floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There seems to be a similar door on the second floor. Can’t we go there?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We can’t use that one.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The condition for opening the rift of spacetime was to clear the 20th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  We were still far from that.
 </p>

 <p>
  We went down to the first floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  The rift of spacetime was open. As we were about to enter, Aaron spoke up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this exploration mission really necessary?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not absolutely necessary.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I replied.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the exploration dungeon was essential to enjoy advanced content, it wasn’t particularly crucial at the moment. It wasn’t as important as the main dungeon or the weekly dungeon. That’s why Anytng hadn’t sent us until we cleared the 15th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Still, it will consume quite a bit of time. At least a day or two. It will probably take longer considering the time difference between there and the waiting room.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are we going to do that will take so long?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m not sure. Won’t we know if we go?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So there’s something you don’t even know.”
 </p>

 <p>
  It wasn’t a dodge.
 </p>
 <p>
  The exploration dungeon was one of the few contents that the Master couldn’t directly see. Sending heroes to the exploration dungeon occasionally yielded rare materials, ascension stones, and very rarely even heroes, but I didn’t know how that happened.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, please distribute pocket money to the heroes! It will make the heroes’ exploration smoother.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Will you give gold to the heroes?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Recommended – 3,000G per person]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes (Selected) / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng pressed ‘Yes’, and a leather pouch fell from the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the pouch were gold coins that sparkled with a golden light. I picked up the pouch.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So he’s giving us travel expenses.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I inspected the inside of the pouch.
 </p>

 <p>
  There were only twelve gold coins, they were all the size of 500 won coins. Considering the system’s recommendation of 3,000 gold per person, it seemed like each gold coin was worth 1,000 gold. I divided the gold coins among the party members, three coins each.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems expensive.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eolka muttered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the gold coins were sparkling, they held no significance within the waiting room. Jenna showed curiosity, but Eolka and Aaron looked at them as if they were rocks.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Gold, huh.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t be entirely sure about the exploration dungeon, but I could make some guesses.
 </p>
 <p>
  I put the gold coins in my pocket and entered the rift of time and space. When the five of us entered, the door closed, and light emanated from the mirror on the right.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Collect various rare materials!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Exploration Dungeon: Explorable (Heim Peninsula)]
 </p>
 <p>
  Heim Peninsula.
 </p>

 <p>
  As far as I remember, it was one of the place names in Townia. It was also the area that was the stage for the 5th and 10th floors.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the exploration dungeon, the area that can be explored increases every 10 floors, and the name of the area is different for each account.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stay alerted. We might have to fight.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The party members nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sometimes heroes sent to the exploration dungeon would die. There was a possibility of battles. However, the death rate was much lower compared to the main dungeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  The light from the mirror on the right grew stronger.
 </p>
 <p>
  The light enveloped the entire rift of time and space.
 </p>
 <p>
  And when the light subsided, we found ourselves in a familiar place.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Party 1’ begins exploration!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Exploration Location – Heim Peninsula]

  [Time Remaining Until Return – 48:00:00]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tips/After completing advanced dungeon research, the hero’s stay time will increase. You can also request the types of items the heroes should collect.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Eolka sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Here again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked around.
 </p>
 <p>
  A river flowed far away. To the right, there was a dense forest. Ahead, there stood high walls. I had seen this place several times. It was a place that couldn’t be forgotten.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Nelsa.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  We were back in the city where we had passed through two boss stages.
 </p>
 <p>
  The only difference from back then was that we weren’t in a combat state. There was no sense of battle anywhere. Jenna put her hand against her eyebrow and scanned the surroundings.
 </p>

  “It’s strange. When we returned, everything was a mess. The forest was on fire, and the walls were destroyed. Many people had died. And now…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s peaceful.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eolka spread her fan.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Jenna said, Nelsa was peaceful. The burnt forest, the corpses that had filled the plains, and the half-collapsed walls had all returned to their original state.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There have been so many bizarre things that this isn’t that surprising.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oppa, what should we do? Should we find the enemies and deal with them?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked to the side.
 </p>
 <p>
  A guy that had been pulling a cart was looking at us with curiosity. He cracked his whip and headed towards the entrance of the city.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were also pedestrians on the street, going to and fro in the city.
 </p>
 <p>
  They either looked at us with interest or ignored us. It was certain that they noticed us. However, there was no sign of hostility.

  “It seems that there’s no need to fight.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I murmured.
 </p>
 <p>
  We couldn’t know the exact situation, but it seemed like we needed to take a look around.

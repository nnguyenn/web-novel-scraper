  Exploration Dungeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike climbing the tower with the goal of completing missions or weekday dungeons for material collection, Exploration Dungeon had the unique feature of an indistinct purpose. Many times, heroes came back empty-handed, but occasionally they brought back rare materials that were worth a glance. There were also items that could only be obtained within the exploration dungeon.

  (T/N: I’m going to use Weekday Dungeon instead of Weekly Dungeon from now on because it’s more accurate.)
 </p>
 <p>
  “We have no choice but to go and see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s true.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eolka nodded in response to my words.
 </p>
 <p>
  We had to enter the city to take a look around. We had a lot of time to decide how to act later.
 </p>
 <p>
  We headed towards the eastern gate of Nelsa along a path through the eastern plains.
 </p>
 <p>
  Merchants, mercenaries, and pedestrians of various attire were coming and going on the road. Two soldiers were inspecting those entering and leaving at the gate. A cart with goods started moving as the gatekeeper cracked his whip.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed the inspection was over. Our turn was approaching. The soldier’s gaze swept up and down my figure, narrowing his eyes as if something seemed suspicious.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please present your passage permit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Passage permit?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t tell me you don’t know what that is? You can’t enter without a passage permit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Two soldiers crossed their spears to block the passage.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took out a gold coin from my pocket.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Will this do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s not a passage permit!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you don’t want it, we’ll have to go to the northern gate. It seems like we can pass through there.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come here!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The soldier snatched the gold coin from my hand, looked around cautiously, and whispered in a hushed tone.

 <p>
  “I’ll let you pass, but don’t cause any trouble.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The soldier swallowed nervously and placed the gold coin in his pocket.
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, his expression became stern.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are the people behind you part of your group?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “In that case…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Give me my gold. I’m going to the north.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Pa-Pass through. Cough.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The soldier cleared his throat and raised his spear.

 <p>
  We entered the passage. Halfway through, Eolka clicked his tongue.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They’re pitiful people.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t money the most important thing to those guys?”
 </p>
 <p>
  We emerged onto the street.
 </p>
 <p>
  Various buildings lined the streets on both sides. The main road was crowded with peddlers selling goods and citizens. The tense atmosphere I felt during the mission was nowhere to be found.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I rested my hand on my chin.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just before clearing the 10th floor, Nelsa was on the brink of being taken over with its defenses breached. It was safe to assume that most of the city had been invaded. The casualties would likely exceed a thousand. However, there were no signs of a massacre in the city.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I need to gather information.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I raised the system message at the top of my field of view.

  [Time Remaining Until Return – 47:48:22]
 </p>
 <p>
  “48 hours.”
 </p>
 <p>
  We will return to the waiting room in two days.
 </p>
 <p>
  I needed to gather as much information as possible about the exploration dungeon. While it wasn’t necessary right now, the exploration dungeon would become a crucial aspect later. It was essential to create an efficient farming route.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Should I look around, Oppa?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What kind of information are you looking for?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though I hadn’t given specific instructions, Jenna and Aaron approached and asked.
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled wryly and replied.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anything.”
 </p>

  “Anything?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, just find something interesting.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The three of them looked at me with puzzled expressions.
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned to face them and continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Didn’t you hear me? Each of you should gather information and enjoy yourselves wherever you like. The master provided money, so you should have plenty. Eat something delicious and do some sightseeing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you serious…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t pretend to rest, actually relax. I’ll take care of the rest.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I could collect information on my own.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the situation was dangerous, it might not be possible, but based on my observations, it seemed feasible for me to handle this alone.
 </p>
 <p>
  Reducing stress levels was important.

 <p>
  It was one of the significant effects of the exploration dungeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  Until now, the members of Party 1 hadn’t properly rested. Even when told to rest, they reluctantly came out to the training grounds.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why, don’t you like it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I said to the three members who were standing there with incredulous expressions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this not a joke?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you mean by that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can we do whatever we want?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I had to repeat my explanation several times to the skeptical members.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng didn’t send us to the exploration dungeon with the intention of achieving results like the Tower. Our research level was too low. To properly farm, dungeon depth research had to be at least level 4. This time was merely a test.
 </p>
 <p>
  After about 10 minutes of persuasion, I was able to make my party members understand.
 </p>

  The need for rest. Conditioning and stress management were among the most important aspects I emphasized while operating Niflheimr.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehe, hehehe… Well then, should I go out? I’m going outside the city. I’m telling you now, don’t try stopping me. I’ll be going far away.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do as you please.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “R-Really? You’re going to see the sea?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eolka disappeared outside the city with an awkward laugh.
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t stop her.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll be returning to the waiting room in two days. Remember that there will be no rest until we clear the 20th floor upon returning. Adjusting your condition is also part of your mission.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you say so, Hyungnim.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll go with Oppa.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t come.”
 </p>

 <p>
  Although Jenna had a disappointed expression, when I told her I would join her in the evening the next day, she finally calmed down.
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, I obtained time to leisurely engage in activities.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having parted ways with the two, I walked the street and looked around.
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t discover anything particularly noteworthy. It was a city just like any other.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, there seemed to be an unusually large number of mercenaries. People armed with weapons could be found all around. They gathered at various places and engaged in conversations.
 </p>
 <p>
  “… How about a strategy for…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It doesn’t work. It’s blocked.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Indeed, we… need to call…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lost in the noise of the city, the conversation was hard to hear.
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t rush. Two days was enough time. I walked the streets while fondling the gold coins in my pocket. I planned to go to an inn or tavern to listen to some conversations. Just then, I noticed a towering building with three floors at an intersection. The sign depicted beer and a chicken.

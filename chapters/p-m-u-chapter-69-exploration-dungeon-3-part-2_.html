 <p>
  It was because the scene from the promotion came to mind. The child in a small room being protected by a woman before being dragged away by that guy. The child also had black hair and black eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “When I first talked to you, I found it interesting. I’ve never seen someone that looked like that kid before. His name…”

 <p>
  “Don’t say it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shut up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not a particularly special name…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked down at the boy.
 </p>
 <p>
  He shrunk back and nodded his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Not yet.’
 </p>
 <p>
  There was still more to think about.
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t want to add another thing to ponder.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where’s the jeweler?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I continued walking and asked.
 </p>
 <p>
  The boy, who had been stiff, suddenly smiled and began to guide me.
 </p>
 <p>
  It might be free, but it wasn’t actually free. I could tell from the boy’s babbling.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where did you get that ancient coin? I heard they only come from high-level dungeons.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hyung, are you a dungeon hunter? A really strong one, I can tell just by looking. You wouldn’t casually toss around treasures like that, if you weren’t, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You didn’t know much about the rumors because you’ve been in dungeons for a long time?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I cleanly ignored the boy’s question.
 </p>
 <p>
  Exchanging the coins for a large number of smaller coins at the jeweler. The owner seemed stubborn and reliable. He didn’t seem like he’d trick me.

  “Where can I buy things from the dungeon?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Dungeon loot is handled by the Mercenary Association. If you just asked me, but you’re a hunter why would…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you an idiot? If I were a hunter, would I be asking you about the dungeon?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The boy had a desperate expression for some reason.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Guide me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  On the second floor of the Mercenary Association, there was a display counter for handling dungeon loot.
 </p>
 <p>
  The core item, “Advent Stone,” was not being handled, but various other items were being sold. The staff mentioned that they were selling various high-class magical artifacts mined from the dungeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  I reunited with Jenna there.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, oppa. You came alone.”

  Coming here meant that she had grasped the existence of the dungeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  As always, she’s quick-witted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What about that bow?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I asked.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna was holding a large bow in her hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  The bow, decorated with gold and silver, looked luxurious at a glance.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You said I needed a longbow before, oppa. The shopkeeper recommended it, so I picked it. It’s said to be magically enhanced, and it looks good, right? You can buy it for two gold coins.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Appraise.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [Glorious Longbow]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Grade: D-]
 </p>

 <p>
  [Magic!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [It looks luxurious, but it’s not very practical as a longbow.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Note – Magic for ‘Reinforcing Durability’ is applied.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The grade is D minus.
 </p>
 <p>
  You could somehow use it, but with that grade, it was worse than the shortbow I gave her as a gift.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s trash.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But it has magic on it. And I didn’t find anything else to spend the money.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Use that money to buy something more valuable.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I pointed to various cheap-looking stones displayed in a corner of the sales counter.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like they were trying to clear their inventory as no one was buying them. Jenna’s eyes sparkled.
 </p>

 <p>
  “That’s… Attribute Stones!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master would probably like it if you brought it. It’s a material for promotion stones.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so? Then what about this bow…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Get rid of it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Other items caught my eye besides lower-grade Attribute Stones.
 </p>
 <p>
  One item of note was the “Regen Stone.” The Regen Stone allowed you to experience the closed boss stage due to a clear, and although you couldn’t gain experience points, you could receive mission experience to pass on to heroes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Items like these didn’t come out often, so it was lucky that a few were visible.
 </p>
 <p>
  It would be very useful for the new heroes joining parties 1 and 2. I picked it up. I took some of Jenna’s money to cover the shortage.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who’s this kid?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As we finished shopping and came out, Jenna made a gesture.
 </p>

 <p>
  A boy was coming awkwardly from inside, looking at Jenna.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t know, he’s a stranger.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I-I’m not a stranger! I’m this person’s exclusive guide. My name is Yoshu.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay, by then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I’d asked all the questions I needed to.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was already getting late. I intended to stay at an inn like this. And tomorrow, I had to keep my promise and have fun with Jenna.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you owe someone money?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hyung, listen to me! I have a secretive investment plan…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Annoying.
 </p>

 <p>
  I could scare him away, but it wouldn’t work.
 </p>
 <p>
  I threw a gold coin I received from Jenna to Yoshu.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh, that’s…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “With this, only one coin is left.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With one gold coin, as long as I didn’t use it in a weird place, it was enough to have fun and eat.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoshu hesitated but accepted the gold coin.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you, Hyung! Noona!”
 </p>
 <p>
  He was just a kid, if he was trying to stab me in the back, I wouldn’t have tolerated him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though it didn’t feel like much, it was a reward for guiding sincerely.

 <p>
  “This should be enough…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This should be enough?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I guess I can take care of my debt now! Thank you for the investment!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled and said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Investment, huh? Trying to start a business?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The details are a secret, investor! I can’t tell you because it’s something that can’t be known. But I’ll definitely repay the favor. I swear!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You don’t need to. I’m not worth much to you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, I can’t live with debts. If there’s something you want, please let me know. Ah, and first, I need the name of the patron…”
 </p>
 <p>
  There wasn’t much to expect.
 </p>
 <p>
  After thinking about it for a while, I spoke up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you get the chance, help that witch.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoshu’s eyes widened.
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled briefly and said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Help her if the opportunity arises. That’s all.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned around and walked away, leaving Yoshu standing there.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna followed suit and said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What were you talking about earlier? Who is the witch?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s that kid we saved. That’s her.”
 </p>
 <p>
  We exchanged various conversations as we headed towards the inn.

  “Come to think of it, where’s Aaron?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I thought he’d be with Jenna.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I asked, Jenna said he had gone out to find a place on his own.
 </p>
 <p>
  I nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  He probably went to do some training.
 </p>
 <p>
  When we would return to the waiting room, Party 1’s break time would be over.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition, the final member of the party would be decided. Either Velkist or Neryssa was the most likely. Or perhaps both.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked back.
 </p>
 <p>
  I saw Yoshu looking around in the distance on the street.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the same place as before, where I had to go to obtain the Advent Stone.

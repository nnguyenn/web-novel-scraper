 <p>
  [Both parties agree to the duel.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A message informing of the duel’s status appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Mutual agreement duel!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do you agree?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes (Selected) / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng didn’t hesitate and pressed ‘Yes.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He seemed to have realized that a party selection match was taking place.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was probably watching with keen interest, enjoying the spectacle, unlike when it was me and Avant, and there were no conditions like synthesis.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sound of swords being drawn echoed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Tell me whenever you’re ready. Let’s start right away.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A cold aura emanated from Velkist’s entire body.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the effect of a triggered skill called “Life Force.” It had the effect of lowering the opponent’s combat power by lowering their mental strength if their mental strength was lacking.
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa was unfazed by it and gripped her swords tightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa also possessed an excellent passive skill called “Composure.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When the two pointed their weapons at each other, I shouted, “Begin.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Before the words were even finished, Velkist lunged.
 </p>
 <p>
  Explosive speed using the recoil from lowering his upper and lower body. His longsword radiated a white light. Neryssa, holding her short sword in her left hand, deflected the blade before calmly thrusting her longsword. Her target was the poorly defended arm and leg. An effective attack strategy considering the nature of the poison.
 </p>

 <p>
  Velkist didn’t defend.
 </p>
 <p>
  He focused solely on evasion, and his right hand continued to unleash sword strikes. Neryssa also combined attack and defense with her longsword and short sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  The two swords clashed, sending sparks flying. The longsword and two swords interlocked, creating a chaotic clash.
 </p>
 <p>
  Asher opened his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That guy… He’s different from when he fought me!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He was hiding his true power.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis sighed again.
 </p>
 <p>
  The main weapons of both were one-handed swords and dual swords. Their weapon skill level was 4, the same as Asher’s. However, their sense of combat was different.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist and Neryssa busily exchanged attacks and defenses throughout the training ground, which was less than a 10m radius. The sound of metal clashing echoed incessantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no hint of them going easy on each other.
 </p>

 <p>
  They fought as if they were going to kill each other. Each pressed the other with their full power.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist’s expression began to show signs of irritation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa kicked the bordering iron bars and leaped up to the ceiling, striking Velkist’s temple.
 </p>
 <p>
  “She’s using the advantages of the location,” I chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa focused on attacking difficult-to-defend areas using the training ground, surrounded by walls on all sides and the ceiling. She applied her agile body movement skills.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Those two, they haven’t been here for long, have they? Impressive. Their levels and skills can’t be that high.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eolka, who had been watching the fight, fluttered her fan and commented. Jenna’s eyes also sparkled.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, for some reason, Aaron was looking at them with a strangely clear, dazzling expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…’
 </p>
 <p>
  I pretended not to notice.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Watch closely. It might be a good learning opportunity.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The intense battle between the two continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist was mainly on the offensive, using high and low attacks, quickly adapting even to the differences in elevation. He swung his sword in all directions, pushing Neryssa into a corner.
 </p>
 <p>
  The outcome was decided in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as Velkist was pushing Neryssa into a corner to finish her off, she quickly threw the danger hidden inside her sleeve.
 </p>
 <p>
  The dagger grazed Velkist’s right arm and passed by.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Velkist (★★)’ is in a bleeding state. His health decreases at regular intervals.]
 </p>
 <p>
  It was only a minor scratch.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the dagger contained an immediate paralysis poison.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Velkist (★★)’ is in a poisoned state.]
 </p>

  [Effect: Paralysis! Some parts of the hero’s body become immobile.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I won…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you really think so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly Velkist swung the hilt of his sword striking Neryssa’s stomach. With a sound like a drumbeat, Neryssa’s mouth opened wide.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A single strike.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nerisa fell down with a thud.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Velkist (★★)’ has won the duel against ‘Neryssa (★★).]
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist sheathed his sword and looked down at Nerisa.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I won.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “It seems that way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You look pathetic. Just shut up b*tch.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist spat on the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  The paralysis poison’s effect had been temporarily nullified by activating his skill “Wild,” but it seemed like he was gradually succumbing to the poisoning.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was an interesting ending.
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa intentionally pushed herself into a corner, luring Velkist to expose his vulnerability. Her previous dual swordsmanship was all a deception, just to hit the hidden dragger once.
 </p>
 <p>
  But Velkist, trusting his skill “Wild,” pushed forward and eventually finished the duel.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That sister is quite something,” Jenna remarked.
 </p>
 <p>
  I glanced at the other members watching the duel.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Only Edis, Roderick, and Jenna seem to have a good grasp of the battle.”
 </p>

 <p>
  The rest were captivated by the spectacle of the duel but didn’t seem to grasp the underlying meaning.
 </p>
 <p>
  *Cough, cough!*
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa curled up and coughed violently. Her neat face was twisted in pain.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist, who was casually watching her, turned his gaze towards me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “As you can see, the result is clear. Senior, do you have any objections?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, I saw it. The conclusion is clear.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “In that case, naturally…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Neryssa will be the member of the first party.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist’s body froze, about to move but stopped.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-12" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  It seemed like the paralysis poison’s effect was still working. Velkist asked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Could you say that again?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I will say it multiple times if you want. Neryssa will be in the first party.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa, who had fallen down, coughed mixed with laughter.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist’s expression crumpled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you know the composition of the first party? A swordsman, a lancer, a magician, and an archer. It consists of four pure combatants. To cope with a wide range of variables, talents like Neryssa are needed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you were overpowered enough to ignore that penalty, I would have considered it, but it doesn’t seem that way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As I finished speaking, Neryssa let out a faint laugh.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If this woman didn’t resort to such dirty moves, I would have defeated her within five minutes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I do acknowledge your talent. However, you’re not needed in our party. That’s all there is to it. Or do you want to fight me? If you last for one minute, I’ll accept you without a word.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, suddenly, he looked towards Aaron.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What about other members?”

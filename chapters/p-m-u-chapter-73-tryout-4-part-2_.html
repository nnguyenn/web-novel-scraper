 <p>
  In any case, all the members of the training ground had left.
 </p>
 <p>
  Only Aaron and I remained in the training ground.

 <p>
  I opened the iron gate of the dueling ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come out. Staying here won’t change anything.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I don’t want to leave.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then I’ll stay.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I entered the dueling ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  The bloodstains Velkist had left were fading. I sat down beside Aaron, who was sitting there.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron muttered in a calm voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I lost.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right, you lost.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I lost because I was weak. That’s all.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron’s voice trembled slightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  I asked, “Why didn’t you aim for his vitals?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron looked at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “At the beginning, you had the advantage. Why did you give Velkist more time? You could have won easily.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We shouldn’t kill our comrades, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “When did you start following that rule?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if Aaron had killed Velkist, I would have found a way to cover it up. I was confident that I could make Iselke state it as a sudden-death, instead of a hero’s murder. Just like she did with the Fangwolves. But Aaron chose a different path. Even when he aimed for the vitals later, it ultimately led to his defeat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t think I raised you to be that weak.”

 <p>
  Aaron gave a bitter smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I just changed my mind. As you know, I don’t have talent.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I may have been able to win now. I actually had confidence that I could. But as time passes, if a little bit more time passes, and that guy comes back stronger…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron’s voice gradually faded.
 </p>
 <p>
  He couldn’t continue.
 </p>
 <p>
  “In fact, do I have the right to kill someone who shines brighter than me…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Looking at Velkist and Neryssa, I felt that what I had been doing was meaningless. No matter how much time and effort I put in… in front of the difference in talent…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that why you showed mercy?”

 <p>
  “We shouldn’t harm the Master. They’re his important assets.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron lowered his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The things you and Jenna see are invisible to me. No matter how I swing my spear, the mist in front of my eyes doesn’t clear. It felt like I was just running in place.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Did he collapse on his own?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron began to change after returning from the 15th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since then, the intensity of training has become much harsher than before. But when I dueled him, he felt weaker than before, despite the amount of training. His confidence had disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now, what will happen to me? I won’t be able to join the 1st party, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “For the time being, you won’t be able to. But you will if you get stronger, though.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The probability wasn’t high.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron probably knows it too. Combat doesn’t suit this guy. It’s been like that from the beginning. He’s just doing it forcefully for his little sister.

 <p>
  “There’s a position called an instructor. It’s a role to teach newcomers on the 1st floor training ground. I think it suits you. It’s the same with Dika.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dika, who went down to the 1st floor, would soon be sent back up.
 </p>
 <p>
  He may be frail, but he’s diligent. Like Aaron, he’s a hard worker, and his skills are solid. If he were given the role of an instructor, he would perform his duties quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s more comfortable than being in the 1st party. You don’t have to worry about dying or shedding blood. The training load also decreases. You just have to teach newcomers in a safe place.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You mean teaching them?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Originally, the competition rate for this job is extremely high. Sometimes it’s dozens to one. I particularly recommend it to both of you. What do you think?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron couldn’t answer easily.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sighed deeply.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s enough for you. You just relax. I’ll be responsible for sending you home safely to your sister.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But…”
 </p>

  “What are you hesitating for? What’s your goal? To be strong like Velkist? Wasn’t it to safely return to your family?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The 1st party was likely to be Aaron’s grave.
 </p>
 <p>
  The same is true for the 2nd party. Although the death rate was low on the 10th to 15th floors, there was no guarantee it would continue like this. Even Eolka, Jenna and I could potentially die. This was the best choice for Aaron himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, but…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron made a complex expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like he wanted to say something, yet he opened, closed his mouth, and chose to remain silent.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sighed deeply.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this how it is…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m sorry, hyungnim. I’ll become an instructor.”

  “To hell with being an instructor.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you don’t want to do it, then don’t do it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron’s eyes widened.
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled and continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Among the people I know, there’s someone like you, Aaron. He was just as talentless. His spear skill was only level 2 when he was at your level. I tried to get rid of him several times because he was so trash.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron blinked his eyes in surprise.
 </p>
 <p>
  He probably couldn’t understand. After all, I was talking about my days of being a master.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you want to get stronger, Aaron?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”

  “Your answer seems to be no.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, it’s not, Hyungnim!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron knelt down.
 </p>
 <p>
  Tears welled up in the corners of his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I want to get stronger! I don’t want to have such miserable thoughts anymore! But for someone like me… there’s no way…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There is a way. Wait until that door opens.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Beyond the open door of the training ground, a tightly sealed rift in dimensions could be seen.
 </p>
 <p>
  I pointed to that door.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll take you to Niflheimr.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where is that?”

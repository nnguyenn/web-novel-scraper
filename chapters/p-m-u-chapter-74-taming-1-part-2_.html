  “I guess we have to go that route.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even if you find one, don’t flaunt it openly. Others might eavesdrop.”

  “Do you think they would something to him?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “In this structure, there are many guys who like to pick on those who are doing well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  This happened when we were in the dungeon. According to what I’ve heard from Chloe, a few days before the two of us came to the second floor, the heroes on the first floor had gone to find Velkist, who was in the training room.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were a group of five attackers.
 </p>
 <p>
  They surrounded Velkist and hurled insults and mockery from all directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist drew his sword without a word and cut off one of the guy’s legs, who was at the front.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, he mercilessly tortured the confused six men without killing them. From the next day on, no one dared to touch Velkist. It was a heartwarming story in a way.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Anyway, it wasn’t a surprising outcome.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis left Asher and Aaron behind and left the training ground with Roderick.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like they were heading to the first-floor training room.  The task was to find someone promising, and if they succeeded, they could join their party after going through some training.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The correct answer is still to do paid summons, though.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Master had experienced failure, but it had unintended consequences.
 </p>
 <p>
  In most cases, advanced summons were a waste, but in this situation, it became the best option. Next time I come in contact with Anytng, I might need to correct this part.
 </p>
 <p>
  The basic stamina training of the morning was over.
 </p>
 <p>
  After lunch, weapon skill training and sparring followed. However, it seemed that everyone was more interested in sparring.
 </p>
 <p>
  After considering our opinions, I said,
 </p>
 <p>
  “All right. It’s better to know each other’s strengths accurately.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I agree. Will we be sparring at the same place as yesterday?”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Yeah. The are no rules. Use real weapons, and any moves are allowed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That sounds good.”
 </p>
 <p>
  We decided to skip today’s weapon skill training.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ve sparred with two new members before, but it was only a few times, not as frequently as I did with Jenna and Aaron. It was a necessary measure to understand each other’s tendencies.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Still, quite an obvious intention.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Both of them had a strong competitive spirit.
 </p>
 <p>
  They probably wanted to try their strength against me. I entered the training ground with my sword. Velkist joined me as if he had been waiting.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’d like to request a match.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alone? Neryssa, come in too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you saying…”

 <p>
  “You want to test my strength, right? It’ll be tough for you alone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist’s eyebrows twitched.
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled. During our sparring, Velkist deliberately concealed his strength. This was evident when you looked at Velkist’s stats and skills.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you sure, senior? It’ll be different from our previous sparring.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you want to fight me one on one?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As I drew my sword, Velkist assumed a cautious stance.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took a deep breath and raised the switch in my head.
 </p>
 <p>
  [“Han (★★)” has entered a state of frenzy!]

 <p>
  “Let’s go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As I aimed my sword, I kicked off the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist swung his sword down swiftly. It was a fast and efficient move.
 </p>
 <p>
  I increased my speed further.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang!
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist’s sword was deflected and stuck in the iron railing.
 </p>
 <p>
  The blade touched Velkist’s neck.
 </p>
 <p>
  A decisive move in a single stroke.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist tended to the shallow wound on his neck, where blood was oozing out.

  “You’re stronger than I expected.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Say it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It was worth coming here. I guess I’m gonna need that woman with me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I sheathed my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa opened the iron window and entered, then said to Velkist, “Insolent bastard. The outcome was obvious.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems so.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please take care of me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa drew her rapier from her waist.
 </p>
 <p>
  A blue liquid sparkled on the blade. It was the paralysis poison used in yesterday’s duel.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was surprised and said, “Are you really using that?”
 </p>

  “You seemed to want it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anyway, this time it’s two against one. Even if I’m your senior, I won’t go easy on you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist pulled out the sword stuck in the iron fence.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took a moment to cool down my head, which had become hot due to the effects of the Frenzy. A cold energy flowed through my body. After calming down, I pointed my sword at them and said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come at me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as I was about to take a step, Velkist and Neryssa scattered left and right.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like they wanted to go on the offensive first. I positioned my sword in a natural posture.
 </p>
 <p>
  Two swordsmen rushed in.
 </p>
 <p>
  And after 1 minute,
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s more than I expected.”
 </p>

 <p>
  Neryssa muttered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nerissa sat down looking up at me. There were poisonous marks scattered nearby.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I never thought even two people wouldn’t be enough.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist couldn’t help but ridicule himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist’s grip was torn, and blood flowed. The sword that had been flung far away was stuck to the ceiling. I snorted and said, “The two of you are still not enough. Moreover, you’re fighting separately.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It was as I expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no teamwork between the two of them. If I defeated one, it was over for the other. Together, they could only stop me for about 20 seconds.
 </p>
 <p>
  It would have been different if it were Aaron and Jenna.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re weak. You’ve been dealing with useless people on the low floors, so you’re overconfident.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I sheathed my sword.
 </p>

 <p>
  I still hadn’t used a shield.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I would work against Aaron and Asher, but beyond that is entirely different. Even if two of you teamed up, it wouldn’t work against me, let alone Jenna.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oppa, did you call me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right, you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I left the training ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll allow the two of you to fight as a team. But I won’t allow solo sparring. The condition is to defeat Jenna.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Types like Jenna and Aaron integrate well into parties and have excellent teamwork, but individuals like Velkist, who are strong-willed, have good abilities but lack cooperation.
 </p>
 <p>
  This needed to be addressed.

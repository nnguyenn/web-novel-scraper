  The first taming is over.
 </p>
 <p>
  The purpose is to emphasize the importance of cooperation.

  I faced Velkist and Neryssa without showing any mercy. Whether it was one-on-one or two-on-one, it didn’t matter. I activated Frenzy Mode constantly and struck them down whenever I saw an opening. There were numerous times when one of them came close to dying.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t this a bit too harsh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m doing what they want.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled at Eolka’s concerned question.
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s still some time left until the climb. Anytng hadn’t sent out Party 1 yet. It seemed like he wanted to give the new members some time to adapt. I decided to make the most of this.
 </p>
 <p>
  The cooperation between the two of them became more refined as the days went by.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist was skilled in close combat, while Neryssa excelled at mid-range. They started learning how to utilize each other’s strengths and cover each other’s weaknesses. Of course, amidst all this, they didn’t forget to exchange insults.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This should be sufficient.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I extended my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  The two of them were lying in a corner of the training ground. They had lasted for three minutes this time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering they couldn’t even last 30 seconds at the beginning, their growth was remarkable.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jenna will join the next sparring session.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you mean?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So you think you’re the only ones allowed to work in a team, we will too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The expressions of the two noticeably stiffened.
 </p>
 <p>
  I continued, “Don’t worry. We’re not fixing the members. It’s me, Jenna, and you two. We’ll take turns fighting with each other. Get to know each other’s characteristics and personalities to find points of cooperation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I thought I would be fighting based on my individual abilities when I joined Party 1,” Velkist said in a low voice, “but this is completely different.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “On the 5th, 10th, and 15th floors, the senior’s ability stood out. Honestly, the others didn’t catch my eye. What’s the point of this kind of training?”

  “Are your eyes full of holes? Alone, I can’t do anything.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if you watched the video of the clears, it would be different from experiencing it firsthand. Or maybe he was just more focused on me when he watched.
 </p>
 <p>
  I spoke from my experience, “Individual abilities are important. No matter how well your teamwork is, if an individual is weak, it falls short. But the opposite is also true. If there is no teamwork, even if individuals are strong, the mission fails.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that true?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course if you have overwhelming strength you can finish the mission alone. But it seems like none of us here, including me, have that kind of ability. Enough complaining; get up. We don’t have much time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “As my Oppa said, I’m going too,” Jenna said.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist and Neryssa got up hesitantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t grumble too much. Once a certain foundation is established, we’ll do individual training until you’re sick of it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll be waiting.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist tightly gripped his sword.

 <p>
  “Not bad.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The speed of their growth and the current situation of being able to spar 2-on-2.
 </p>
 <p>
  I quite liked it. Until now, except for Eolka, we were always odd-numbered, so we couldn’t do this type of training. Even if we put members from two parties together, it was inefficient to fight as a party.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I pointed my sword and ran forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna’s arrow narrowly missed me from behind.
 </p>
 <p>
  Training continued late into the night.
 </p>
 <p>
  Apart from the morning’s basic training and a bit of weapon skill training in the afternoon, we spent all our time sparring. We changed the members after each round. There was a side effect that the side I entered usually won, but Velkist and Neryssa gradually got along with Party 1.
 </p>
 <p>
  A week passed like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, we inserted Eolka and started formation training.

 <p>
  Eolka’s and Jenna’s vulnerabilities. How to defend against them. How to use their strengths. I actively coached Velkist and Neryssa on how to use the techniques I had analyzed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The more I know, the more amazed I am. Each tactic is intricate and efficient.”
 </p>
 <p>
  One evening after training was over.
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa looked at me and shook her head. “I can’t imagine what you’ve been doing in your past life.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Didn’t I say I was from a farmer?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s better to change that lie.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled bitterly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The next evening.
 </p>
 <p>
  It had been a considerable amount of time since the last climb was over.

  [Party 1, gather at the 1st-floor plaza!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle’s loud voice echoed through the training center.
 </p>
 <p>
  I wiped the blade with a piece of cloth that had tree sap on it and then left the personal training ground. The four members of Party 1 were there as if they had been waiting at the entrance of the training center.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The intention is clear.”
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s no reason to go down to the lower levels now.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist and Neryssa finished the 14th floor before joining Party 1.
 </p>
 <p>
  They had honed their senses through training that simulated real battles.
 </p>
 <p>
  All that remained was the climb.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ve waited a long time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A smile played at the corner of Velkist’s mouth.
 </p>

 <p>
  I sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you really prefer going out to fight?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I think it’s better than dealing with wooden dolls.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anyway, we’re gathering on the 1st floor. You understand it’s not for leisure, right? Get ready.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Before leaving the training center on the 2nd floor, Aaron approached me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I hope you’re well, hyungnim.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No need to say it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I waved my hand and descended to the 1st floor.

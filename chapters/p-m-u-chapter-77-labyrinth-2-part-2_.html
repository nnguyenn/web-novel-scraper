 <p>
  Neryssa, who was in charge of advanced reconnaissance, approached me with a different expression than usual. Her gaze held a sense of caution. Neryssa spoke briefly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Enemies.”

 <p>
  Velkist drew his sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna readied her bow, and Eloka controlled her breath.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I assume they are in the adjacent hall.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. There are seven of them. They’re wearing armor and armed with swords, spears, and crossbows.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You should join us then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa drew her rapier and stood next to Jenna.
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned and said, looking at them,
 </p>
 <p>
  “As soon as we enter the hall, ambush the enemy. Jenna and Neryssa will take care of the archers, and the rest of us will take care of the swordsmen and spearmen. From now until the battle begins, make no noise.”
 </p>
 <p>
  All four of them nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was a faint tension in their expressions. I moved forward as quietly as possible while suppressing my footsteps. The corridor ended right ahead. There, I heard someone’s voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  I raised my left hand, covered with a shield, and folded my fingers one by one.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a signal indicating the timing of the assault.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Three. Two.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I folded the last finger.
 </p>
 <p>
  “One.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t shout any battle cries.
 </p>
 <p>
  I rushed into the hall. My eyes met those of a man who was leaning against the wall, swallowing something.
 </p>
 <p>
  His pupils reflected my figure.

  [Human Soldier Lv.14] X 7
 </p>
 <p>
  A message indicating the enemy appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Bingo.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I threw the dagger I had been holding in my left hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud.
 </p>
 <p>
  The dagger plunged into the soldier’s throat.
 </p>
 <p>
  He choked without even letting out a scream.
 </p>
 <p>
  Next to him, the soldier who was about to aim a spear vomited blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist, who had advanced rapidly, swung his sword. He beheaded one soldier and then turned his body to impale another soldier through the chest. Blood splattered along the path of the sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ping!

 <p>
  An arrow struck the right eye of a soldier who was reloading a crossbow.
 </p>
 <p>
  The arrowhead must have penetrated his brain. The soldier fell forward in a kneeling position. Almost simultaneously, the second arrow flew, piercing the heart of another crossbowman.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no need for me to deal with all seven.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Velkist and Neryssa cleared the enemy ranks, one by one, Jenna aimed her arrows at the gaps.
 </p>
 <p>
  I quickly scanned the hall.
 </p>
 <p>
  This wasn’t a small hall like the ones we had passed through so far. It was a large hall, similar to when we were first summoned here. In front, a staircase leading to the upper floor was visible.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s a door at the back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist’s sword struck down the last soldier’s chest.
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as I confirmed the guy’s breathing had stopped, I picked up the glass bead that had been on the display shelf and threw it down the stairs.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crash!
 </p>

 <p>
  The glass bead hit the transparent wall and shattered into pieces.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Eloka, prepare a level 1 fire spell in the direction of the main door.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sure?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If I ask you to do it, do it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay, I got it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka nodded urgently and began chanting the incantation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flames began to envelop Eloka’s entire body. With each incantation, the flames surrounding her grew denser. Velkist and Neryssa took a step back.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang!
 </p>
 <p>
  After a loud noise, the hall’s main door swung open.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dozens of soldiers waiting outside rushed in.
 </p>

 </p>
 <p>
  A red light flashed in Eloka’s eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ignite!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The incantation ended.
 </p>
 <p>
  A straight line of flames swept over the group of soldiers. Those hit by the flames turned into torches. The acrid smoke and the smell of burning flesh filled the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Velkist, Neryssa, right!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The flames swept through the center of their formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  The enemies scattered left and right. Following my orders, Velkist and Neryssa moved to the right. I ignored the soldier who had rushed at me from the left and used my shield to strike the head of the knight who followed behind him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>

 <p>
  The knight staggered. I thrust my sword into the gap in his armor. I could feel the sensation of bones piercing and organs being punctured at my fingertips. The knight fell without a word.
 </p>
 <p>
  A soldier with a spear lunged at me from the side.
 </p>
 <p>
  I ignored him and thrust the tip of my sword into the throat of the soldier behind him. The soldier, who had tried to pierce with his spear, fell over with an arrow through his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  If they had attacked us in a formation, it might have been a bit troublesome, but Eloka’s flames perfectly blocked their path. Jenna and I picked off the soldiers struggling in the flames one by one.
 </p>
 <p>
  The situation on the right was the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Velkist and Neryssa had not yet developed fire resistance, it wasn’t difficult for them to deal with isolated enemies. The bodies of the soldiers piled up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kraaaah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A knight whose body was on fire swung his sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  I blocked it with my shield and then swung my sword forcefully. The bent steel plate was cut away, and blood spurted from the insides.
 </p>
 <p>
  This guy was the last one.
 </p>

 <p>
  The 23 new enemies that had appeared were wiped out in less than five minutes. I immediately threw my dagger towards the stairs. This time, the thrown dagger stuck into the carpet on the stairs.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Situation under control. Let’s regroup.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I wiped the blood off my sword onto the curtain.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka approached hesitantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How did you know?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you talking about?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The second wave of enemies.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is that what she’s talking about?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The other members also seemed curious as they sent questioning glances my way.
 </p>
 <p>
  After confirming that the blood on the sword was gone, I put it into its sheath.
 </p>

 <p>
  “It’s a simple check. I just used the characteristics of the wall.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Not only your body but also objects you touch cannot pass through the transparent wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  The hall’s stairs were an obvious passage to the next floor but were walled off.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The wall was still there after we annihilated the first patch of enemies.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A question mark appears on the four faces.
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled lightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No need to force yourself to understand.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a clever use of the game’s rules. Those who didn’t know the existence of the game called “Pick Me Up” would find it difficult to use.
 </p>
 <p>
  After completing the maintenance, I looked at the stairs.
 </p>
 <p>
  The end of the stairs leading upwards was shrouded in darkness.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll clear it if we go there.”
 </p>
 <p>
  However, it was in the form of stairs, not an exit.
 </p>
 <p>
  It meant that a similar mission would repeat on the next floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the party members and said,
 </p>
 <p>
  “When we reach the 17th floor, we should prepare a bit before coming up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Agreed. Seems like it’s a boring mission.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is smashing everything your preference?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “To be honest…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled and went up the stairs.
 </p>
 <p>
  As my foot touched the darkness at the top of the stairs, a message appeared.

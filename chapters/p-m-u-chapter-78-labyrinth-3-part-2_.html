  Neryssa bowed deeply to me and then left the dining hall.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sat alone in the dining hall, continuing to drink water. The information gained from Neryssa’s conversation and the bounty on the exploratory dungeon I had seen were on my mind.

 <p>
  ‘The four major families, Halkion, and the church that issued the wanted order for the little girl are connected.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Word has it that most of the donations the denomination receives go to Halkion.
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t know exactly what the organization was, but judging by the situation on the 15th floor, it seemed related to a goddess. And it was an opposing force to the special NPC, Priasis, who was part of the mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is a headache.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned my head and concluded that there was no way to know.
 </p>
 <p>
  I initially wondered why I had to deal with such annoying concerns. My job was to complete the missions, ascend the tower, and find a way back to Earth. I had no interest in getting involved in these petty struggles.
 </p>
 <p>
  I ignored the context.
 </p>
 <p>
  I selected only the information that would be helpful.
 </p>
 <p>
  From my conversation with Neryssa, there were two gains.
 </p>
 <p>
  First, the fact that the Golden Mansion, the background of the labyrinth, consists of five floors.
 </p>
 <p>
  It coincided perfectly with the current floor levels, from the 16th to the 20th. I couldn’t help but feel a bit annoyed. The labyrinth was not a field I particularly favored. After all, what master liked such a field?
 </p>
 <p>
  Second, the knowledge that those affiliated with the Halkion family residing on the 5th floor of the Golden Mansion had dragon’s blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  This allowed me to confirm the type of boss monster that would appear on the 20th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Damn.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I gulped down water.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dragons. Among the countless monsters in Pick Me Up, they were one of the most challenging to deal with, boasting strength that rivaled the highest ranks, without any notable weaknesses. Some magic or equipment had elemental advantages, but there was simply no way to acquire them on the current floor. At the moment, they were one of the most challenging monsters to face.
 </p>
 <p>
  At least, it was comforting to know that they weren’t pure-blooded dragons.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were considered hybrids, so they wouldn’t be completely powerful. In a way, that was to be expected. Pure dragons were game-breaking monsters that shouldn’t appear on the 20th floor.

 <p>
  ‘Is there anything I can do?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I had a rough idea of the mission composition, but there were no personnel or equipment available for replacements.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the moment, the only thing I could do was to climb up to the 19th floor without any losses.
 </p>
 <p>
  The next morning.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well before the assembly time, I placed an order with Amarine, the kitchen assistant, to prepare preserved rations. The 16th floor had ended in a day, but subsequent stages might require staying for several days. We needed something to eat.
 </p>
 <p>
  I also requested the members at the equipment production facility to create storage backpacks and camping gear.
 </p>
 <p>
  They reluctantly complied, making various items such as tents and sleeping bags. I stacked them in one corner of the warehouse.
 </p>
 <p>
  And after the morning training, we spoke while having lunch in the dining hall.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Eat while you listen.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The attention of the four people gathered.

  “As early as tonight, or at the latest within two days, we’ll go to the 17th floor. It’ll probably be the same labyrinth as last time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, I see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna pursed her lips.
 </p>
 <p>
  She seemed quite unhappy.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Things might get complicated from the 17th floor. We might end up spending the night finding our way. To prepare for that, let’s divide our roles.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The backpacks filled with rations and tools were categorized into three.
 </p>
 <p>
  I decided that Velkist, Jenna, and I would share them. Neryssa, who had a lot of activity, and Eloka, who had low stamina, were excluded. Afterward, I informed them of the order and timing of the night watch.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka let out a deep sigh.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are we going to stay there for that long?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We might not come out at all.”

 <p>
  In fact, such cases were known.
 </p>
 <p>
  Parties that couldn’t find their way in the labyrinth starved to death. Masters who experienced this incident strongly protested to headquarters, but they received the response that it was normal gameplay. It wouldn’t be that bad since it was a lower floor, but it’s better to be prepared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems that the kids going to play outside?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist chuckled sarcastically.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Once we get past this section, it will turn into a short-term mission.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Once the labyrinth was completed, it wouldn’t appear again within at least ten floors.
 </p>
 <p>
  I hadn’t studied mission types just for show. I had a deep understanding of what types of mazes existed and what was the most efficient way to explore them. Even if a complex maze appeared, I was confident I could break through it within three days.
 </p>
 <p>
  I mumbled to myself while eating meat and took out a piece of paper from my pocket.
 </p>
 <p>
  The paper had basic maze patterns I had researched drawn on it. No matter how complex the paths became, the basics didn’t deviate from this.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s that?”

 <p>
  “Don’t worry about it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can you give it to me for a moment?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist reached out for the paper.
 </p>
 <p>
  I moved my right hand. Velkist’s hand grabbed nothing but thin air. Velkist’s eyebrows furrowed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You don’t seem to like me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So you finally get it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I laughed.
 </p>
 <p>
  And in the evening after a day’s schedule.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng divided the heroes on the 1st floor into lower floors and weekly dungeons and called us.
 </p>
 <p>
  [1 Party, gather at the 1st-floor plaza!]

 <p>
  It was just as expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  The four of us who were waiting got up in unison. Three backpacks taken from the warehouse were lined up against the training center’s wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  I grabbed the leftmost backpack.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the same time, a system message appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★★)’ requests to carry the ‘Leather Backpack.’ Will you accept?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Leather Backpack’ – Items: Waterskin, firewood…….]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes (Selected) / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  The cursor touched YES.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have to take care of all the annoying stuff.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I tightened the strap and fixed the backpack before leaving the training center.

 <p>
  Velkist and Jenna’s backpack requests were also accepted. We headed down to the 1st-floor plaza.
 </p>
 <p>
  Following Iselle’s guidance, we entered through the rift in spacetime. As soon as we entered, the door closed, and a message indicating the current floor appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Main Dungeon, the current challenge floor is the 17th floor.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The door will open in 10 seconds. Get ready!]

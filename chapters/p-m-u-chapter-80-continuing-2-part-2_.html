  [Both parties, gather in the square!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle’s voice, calling both parties, echoed.

 <p>
  Another meeting, just like yesterday. It seemed like we were intent on circling the 18th floor like we did before.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We don’t have much time left until the climb.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I stood up from my chair.
 </p>
 <p>
  The crumpled cup was back to normal.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist stood up as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  “When the second party reaches an appropriate level, we’ll head there immediately. Be prepared so you won’t regret it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You should be careful too, Sumbae. It would be troublesome if you got caught up with me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I like your confidence.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled and drew my sword from its sheath.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka had gone into the magic library. She was looking for books related to casting.
 </p>
 <p>
  That night.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Skill Awakening!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Han (★★)’s Basic Swordsmanship has reached Lv.8!]
 </p>
 <p>
  I broke through to weapon skill level 8.
 </p>
 <p>
  Preparations for the ascent had been steadily progressing even while I was training.
 </p>
 <p>
  The equipment created this time was a D+ ranked leather armor. Considering the level of materials, it was quite a good grade. Several sets of leather armor were made and distributed between the first and second parties. In addition, Anytng steadily produced consumables like throwing daggers, antidotes, and healing potions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Useful talent had also been coming up to the second floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  First, there was a pharmacist who could make healing potions. She was assigned to the magic library.
 </p>

 <p>
  Next, Dica, the guy who became an instructor, returned to the second floor. Dica came to me, since I recommended him as an instructor, and repeatedly bowed in gratitude. Besides that, a few assistants from the support group were mixed in.
 </p>
 <p>
  The third party had also begun full-fledged activities.
 </p>
 <p>
  The third party was progressing with a steep pace that surpassed the second party.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a necessary step. There was a possibility that we would need up to three parties for the 20th-floor challenge. After this challenge was over, it seemed that they would join the second floor as an official party rather than just a gathering of promising talents for the second party.
 </p>
 <p>
  “He’s preparing seriously for the 20th floor.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The 20th floor is tough.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anyone who had seen the strategy I sent would know that.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ve had my fair share of struggles on the 20th floor as well. I’ve experienced exactly three total party wipes. But here, I couldn’t afford a single failure, not on the 20th floor, nor on any future missions.
 </p>
 <p>
  I knew just how absurd this condition was, but I had no intention of giving up.
 </p>
 <p>
  I would use everything at my disposal.

 <p>
  And I would survive and return to Earth.
 </p>
 <p>
  That had been my unchanged goal ever since I came here.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Whatever happens.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I closed the file.
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the file were records of boss types and various patterns for the boss battles. We couldn’t know exactly which one would appear, but most of the strategies were memorized.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked up at the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sky was shrouded in a pale darkness.
 </p>
 <p>
  A time when everyone was asleep. It was already the deep hours of the early morning, past midnight.
 </p>
 <p>
  The competition would likely start tomorrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  The leveling up for both parties has been completed since yesterday.
 </p>

 <p>
  The distribution of enhanced equipment was also finished.
 </p>
 <p>
  Everyone has been noticed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s good because the timing is obvious.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled lightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had done the same thing when I was a master. It was a signal of preparation before the strategy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then the next day,
 </p>
 <p>
  The heroes would prepare on their own.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the morning, I spoke to the people gathered in the dining hall.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s no training today. Wait until evening. Don’t waste your strength recklessly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  All members of the first and second parties were present in the dining hall.
 </p>

  “If there are any anomalies, report them. If you’re too scared to go out, for whatever reason, then I’ll actively try to speak up to the master.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you trying to get us synthesized?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist laughed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Caught ya?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t think it’s a joke.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis responded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Second party, are you ready?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at Edis and said. Behind her, members of the second party, including Roderick and Aaron, were seated.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re pretty much ready. It seems like we can participate.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This time, you’ll also participate. It’s different from the 15th floor.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “We know.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘And even though they’re not here, maybe even the third party.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked around at the heroes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master will take some time to connect. If there’s anything left undone, do it. Write a will or whatever. For those who write wills, I’ll personally tear them up if you die.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you think we’ll be able to return safely from this mission?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis said to me with uncertainty in her eyes. I smirked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Only if we do your job properly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I stood up from my seat.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a signal, people began to get up one by one and disperse. Some headed to the kitchen to order something delicious, while others went toward their lodgings. A group headed to the lounge as well. Amidst all this, some were writing wills.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you really going to write a will?”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Don’t pay attention to it,” Eloka stuck out her tongue.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka quickly folded the paper and headed to her room. It seemed like she intended to finish writing it in her room. The dining hall emptied out in less than a minute. I spoke to Aaron, who had been sitting quietly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Make sure I don’t break my promise.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron smiled and placed his spear in his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have absolutely no intention of dying.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good to hear.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where are you going, hyungnim?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m going to take a nap.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, I had no plans to do anything leisurely.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was planning to go through the data once more in my room, until Anytng connected.

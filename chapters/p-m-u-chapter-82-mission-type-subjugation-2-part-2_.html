  [[Han (★★)] has entered a bleeding state. Health will decrease at regular intervals.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The second bleeding message appeared.

 <p>
  There was no opportunity to drink a potion this time.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is Oppa in danger…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Focus on yourselves!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I yelled without turning back.
 </p>
 <p>
  The scales buried in the sand were not in small numbers. If we didn’t deal with them in time, they would become a problem.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, after three minutes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka, unable to bear it any longer, screamed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What on earth is this! Our attacks don’t work! Weird creatures keep coming! Are they telling us to die?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I glanced back.
 </p>
 <p>
  Blood was flowing through Eloka’s torn clothes. The other three didn’t look good either. The shadows kept rising.
 </p>
 <p>
  I swung my sword at the Black Dragon’s eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This monster is physically immune!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Damn.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Black Dragon’s pupils narrowed mockingly.
 </p>
 <p>
  I quickly rolled to the side. Its claws and tail plunged deeply into the ground. Sand sprayed like a fountain. I managed to avoid a fatal blow, but my reinforced armor was already in tatters.
 </p>
 <p>
  I shouted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hold on a little longer!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How long are we supposed to wait?”

 <p>
  Velkist’s voice was filled with irritation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I don’t know.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I swallowed the rest of my words.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no time. The Black Dragon relentlessly pursued me. I couldn’t afford to think for too long. We could only endure and look around.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Waiting.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I whispered to myself.
 </p>
 <p>
  An invincible foe. Endless shadow summons. A situation that seemed utterly hopeless.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the circumstances were gradually changing.
 </p>
 <p>
  First, the audience.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the battlements, countless chairs had appeared out of nowhere. And in those chairs, dozens of armored soldiers were seated, as if they were spectators watching our fight.
 </p>

 <p>
  Secondly…
 </p>
 <p>
  “…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I quickly stepped back.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Black Dragon’s claws extended like spears, leaving a small scratch on my neck. The Black Dragon lunged at me, seemingly trying to crush me with its entire body. I exerted force in my toes and leaped away. The distance between us increased.
 </p>
 <p>
  “When I watched Sumbae’s fights, I can’t help but think that this mission looks quite interesting.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist, who was behind me, spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  The extended blade of his sword was covered in black blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you sure you can kill that thing?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re talking a lot.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I took a shallow breath.
 </p>

 <p>
  Pain surged through me. My whole body was covered in minor wounds already. The Black Dragon was standing up, looking at me. Its crimson pupils glowed ominously.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Field Formation Completed!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, deployment of the reinforcements is now available.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Extend a helping hand to the hero in distress!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Green holograms etched letters into the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Select the reinforcements.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Designated Party – ‘1st Party (Engaged)’, ‘2nd Party’, ‘3rd Party’…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  A bright white light appeared in one corner of the battlement.
 </p>
 <p>
  Everyone’s gaze turned towards it.
 </p>

 <p>
  “It’s a bit late.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘2nd Party’ has been selected.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Party Composition – ‘Edis (★★★)’, ‘Roderick (★★★)’…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do you want to send them on the mission?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes (Select) / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  The light shone so brightly that it enveloped the entire field.
 </p>
 <p>
  And from within the light, figures emerged one by one. Jenna, who had been staring blankly, exclaimed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Those people… It’s the 2nd Party!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis, who was at the front, spotted us beneath the battlement.
 </p>

 <p>
  Her expression froze.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Han? But that person is…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Unfortunately.”
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no time to explain.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kraaah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Black Dragon charged.
 </p>
 <p>
  I quickly moved away from the 1st Party area. The Black Dragon followed, swinging its front paws back and forth. I blocked its swinging tail with my shield.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crash!
 </p>
 <p>
  The shield flew from my left hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was unusable. The battered shield had split in half and stuck into the sand. My only remaining weapon was a single sword. Losing it would be dangerous.

 <p>
  “Hyungnim!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron rushed toward me in desperation.
 </p>
 <p>
  An invisible barrier blocked his way.
 </p>
 <p>
  Above the battlement.
 </p>
 <p>
  Below the arena.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were two separate fields.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You must have understood the situation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With my back against the battlement, I spoke to Edis above.
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis, who had been observing me, the 1st Party in the center of the arena, and the Black Dragon on the battlement from above, nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Silent.
 </p>

 <p>
  With a soft sound, two daggers spun in Edis’s palm.
 </p>
 <p>
  “2nd Party, prepare for battle.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Our target?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Roderick asked, and Edis pointed to a small altar at the end of the battlement.
 </p>
 <p>
  A goddess statue stood on the altar, and a faint red light surrounded it.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Human Soldier Lv.18] X 18
 </p>
 <p>
  [Human Knight Lv.20] X 5
 </p>
 <p>
  The soldiers who had been sitting on the chairs all stood up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Their lively gazes were fixed on the 2nd Party. Roderick and Asher unsheathed their spears and swords. The newly joined archer in the 2nd Party fitted an arrow to the bow.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m in your care.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I muttered as I dashed forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis’s daggers pierced the forehead of the frontmost soldier. To the left and right of Edis, Roderick and Aaron swung their long spears. The soldiers who took the blows fell, vomiting blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kraaah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Black Dragon’s claws struck the battlement.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had no shield. Blocking had become difficult. I focused on every move the creature made.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The vanguard handles the boss. The rear handles the objective.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A multi-task mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  I swung down with my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This monster is physically immune!]
 </p>
 <p>
  This bastard was still immune.

 <p>
  The second backup has arrived.
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, the created object is a ballista. There is already an arrow the size of a human body attached to the firing mechanism. It was the weapon that would deliver the deadly blow I had pondered over.

 <p>
  ‘However.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the opposite side of the tower.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Human Soldier Lv.18] X 43
 </p>
 <p>
  [Human Knight Lv.20] X 6
 </p>
 <p>
  Soldiers were coming up from below the castle walls. They rushed towards the altar like a torrent.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kuk!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The tip of the sword grazed Edis’s cheek. Small drops of blood splattered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis’s expression contorted. While dead soldiers fell below the castle wall one after another, even more of them were constantly rushing forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hurry!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I shouted to the third party running towards the tower, then gripped my sword tightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sambai, it seems it’s time to switch.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I agree.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I stepped back from my position.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment, the Black Dragon’s jaws came charging, but Velkist’s sword thrust into its snout.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kuooh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sounds satisfying.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist chuckled as he retrieved his sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Next to him, Neryssa, with her rapier spread out, stood there. Venom dripped from the gleaming tip of her white sword.

 <p>
  “Do you think the poison is effective?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “To some extent.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Black Dragon’s left eye was closed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Between the closed eyelids, a thin stream of purple blood trickled down.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It lost its depth perception. Use that well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll keep that in mind.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kraaah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  They dodged the swinging tail with a leap.
 </p>
 <p>
  I moved toward our party members. Along the way, I encountered a few shadows. I slowed my movement. Dodged, then slashed the throat. I dispatched all five shadowy figures and joined our base.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!

  Jenna, who had finished aiming, released the trigger.
 </p>
 <p>
  The arrow, tearing through the air, struck the Black Dragon’s wing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How many arrows do you have left?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Um, about five.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Use them all.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I took out the remaining half of the potion and drank it.
 </p>
 <p>
  I assessed the situation. The second party was defending the altar on the left side of the castle wall. On the right side of the wall, the Third Party was ascending the tower where the ballista was installed, followed by soldiers chasing them.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s no time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Once the altar is retaken, and the blessing disappears, this monster will become immune again.

 <p>
  Our chances of winning are less than 10%. We had to finish it off before the defenses of the second party were completely broken. I threw the empty glass bottle and swept away the shadows near our base.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m coming, Sharn!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I saw Sharn climbing the tower through the window.
 </p>
 <p>
  Behind her were the members of her party and soldiers.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Take care of the ballista. The other four, block the path!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I raised my voice so that Sharn could hear.
 </p>
 <p>
  The short-haired girl nodded. Soon, Sharn, who had climbed to the top of the tower, began to handle the ballista.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How do you shoot this…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do I have to explain that too?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll try! The rest of you, protect us!”

 <p>
  “Hurry!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis’s tone became urgent.
 </p>
 <p>
  The second party withdrew to the rear, but they were approaching their limit. Eloka, who had emptied two bottles of magic potions, said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shall I shoot one more time? If the situation is right…”
 </p>
 <p>
  A white flame rose from Eloka’s hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was different from the flames she used before. It was affected by the blessing. I sliced the shadows with my sword and said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not the time. Wait.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna’s last arrow hit the creature’s body.

 <p>
  There were a total of seven arrows embedded in the Black Dragon’s body. However, it paid no attention to them and continued to move its body relentlessly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It seems this won’t be enough.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s incredibly tough.
 </p>
 <p>
  I frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I just used my last arrow!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “From now on, take out your daggers. Deal with the shadows and protect Eloka.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it. What about you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m joining the front lines.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At the top of the tower, Sharn was fiddling with the ballista, her face showing a puzzled expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  Squeak, squeak.
 </p>

 <p>
  With the sound of metal clashing, the ballista’s body slowly turned. Sharn, who was holding the aiming device, had a perplexed look on her face as she aimed at the Black Dragon.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Th-that thing! It’s too fast!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s why I’m going.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I muttered and raised my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Black Dragon alternated its attacks between Velkist and Neryssa. The moment I joined them, it swept the ground with its tail, I kicked it away with my foot, and slashed it with my sword. The black blood splattered, and I said to the two of them,
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s a ballista behind us. We need to pin the creature down to ensure the arrows hit it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa held out the rapier to mer
 </p>
 <p>
  I placed my blade on the rapier and drew. My blade was tainted with venom.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  “Kraaaaa!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Black Dragon, with only its right eye remaining, roared. Its wings folded, obscuring its sight. Velkist pushed its left wing, and Neryssa pushed its right wing. I charged forward and thrust the venom-coated sword deep into the creature’s right leg.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now! Fire!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  A sound like an explosion rang out.
 </p>
 <p>
  The massive bolt that had been shot from the ballista embedded itself in the Black Dragon’s side. The bolt was over 2 meters long. Blood gushed out like a waterfall, and the dragon’s body leaned heavily to the side.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just one more shot.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It was not enough.
 </p>
 <p>
  If we could land just one more shot, Eloka could prepare her magic, and we could finish it off. I shouted towards the tower,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Reload!”
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment, a message appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Sharn(★★)’ has returned to the embrace of the goddess! Her determination will be remembered forever.]

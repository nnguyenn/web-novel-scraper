 <p>
  I urgently looked up at the tower.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the ballista platform, Sharn lay prone. Blood flowed from an arrow lodged in her throat.

 <p>
  “She’s dead!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Outside the tower door, a soldier’s arrow had pierced her throat.
 </p>
 <p>
  One of her party members who had been swinging his sword frantically noticed Sharn’s lifeless body.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Nadin(★★)’ is feeling fear. All attributes are reduced by 30%.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A weak groan escaped the man’s lips.
 </p>
 <p>
  I gritted my teeth and shouted, “Clear the body! Someone else take the ballista!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The other members also turned their attention to Sharn.
 </p>
 <p>
  But their reactions were different from my orders.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Ronnie(★★)’ is panicking. All attributes are reduced by 50%.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Zakail(★★)’ is in fear…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “These idiots…”
 </p>
 <p>
  They lacked experience.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sudden surge of fear had overwhelmed the three parties like wildfire. Velkist’s expression grew thin.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is not going well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Black Dragon was still staggering, but it would continue moving.
 </p>
 <p>
  The bolt that had pierced its side did not seem like a fatal wound. I turned my sword vertically and shouted,
 </p>
 <p>
  “We must pile up damage before it recovers. Prepare to attack.”

  “What about ballista?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Leave it be.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though one of them got killed, if they had remained calm, a second shot might have been possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  But my voice did not reach them. The rapid decline in abilities had broken through their defenses.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Ronnie(★★)’ has returned to the embrace of the goddess! His determination will be remembered forever.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Death messages kept appearing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soldiers were pushing through the breached defenses of the Third Party.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Nadin(★★)’ has returned to the embrace of the goddess! Her determination will be remembered forever.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Zakail(★★)’ has returned to the embrace of the goddess! His determination…]
 </p>
 <p>
  My blade remained stuck in the Black Dragon’s right leg.

 <p>
  I pulled out a dagger from my belt and moved to the dragon’s side. I examined the spot where the bolt had struck. Among the torn scales and leather, I saw a vital spot. Without hesitation, I plunged the dagger in.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Grrrrrrr…”
 </p>
 <p>
  A boiling sound emanated from the dragon’s throat.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Party 3’ has been wiped out!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The right side of the castle wall had been completely occupied.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Asher(★★)’ is in a critical condition. His life is in danger!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “This… We’re done for!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud! Thud! Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  I continued to drive the dagger into the dragon’s wound.
 </p>
 <p>
  The dragon twitched with each strike, but there was no noticeable reaction. When Velkist and Neryssa were about to launch another attack,

 <p>
  “Kraaaaa!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The dragon roared and spun its body around.
 </p>
 <p>
  I quickly stepped back. The longsword that had been stuck in its front leg was flung away, sliding across the ground. I picked it up with my foot and held it in my right hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh! Asher!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Asher(★★)’ has returned to the embrace of the goddess! His determination will be remembered forever.]
 </p>
 <p>
  In the second party,
 </p>
 <p>
  the first casualty had occurred.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s no time for that!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Eloka, prepare your magic!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh, there’s just no time!”

 <p>
  I looked back.
 </p>
 <p>
  The main base was surrounded by dozens of shadows. Jenna brandished her dagger, and Eloka swung her white flames like torches to dispel the shadows.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You two, get back. I’ll stay here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stay safe.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The two of them rushed back to the main base.
 </p>
 <p>
  I stood my sword upright. The blade had a faint golden web-like pattern on its surface.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Grr, grr, grrr…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Foam mixed with saliva dripped from the Black Dragon’s mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna’s arrows covered its body, and a ballista bolt was lodged in its side. Its wings were torn to shreds, and its entire body was covered in gaping wounds oozing with blood. Purple was mixed in with the blood. The poison had intensified.

  But it wasn’t dead.
 </p>
 <p>
  The creature stared at me with its one remaining eye, blinking.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kraaa!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Black Dragon swung its right hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  I twisted my upper body to dodge it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m targeting its heart.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The part where the ballista bolt was lodged, where the scales were torn away.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to my analysis, if I drove a sword all the way in there, it would reach the heart. Even if it didn’t, it didn’t matter; that area was where the vital organs gathered. I could inflict a fatal wound.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Party 1, when I give the signal, we’ll focus our attacks on it. Got it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it. We’re almost done here!”

 <p>
  I looked towards the altar.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was shaky, but they were holding the last line of defense. Edis was in the front, followed by Roderick and Aaron. In the rear was the archer, Diran. The four of them formed a defensive line, blocking the enemy’s advance.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Edis, just one more minute!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I prepared to charge.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment, a blade erupted from Diran’s chest as she aimed her bow from the edge of the wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Uh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Diran’s body fell beneath the wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  Below, numerous soldiers were waiting.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Duran(★★)’ has returned to the embrace of the goddess! His determination will be remembered forever.]
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no time to assess the situation.

 <p>
  I immediately raised my sword and charged. My target was the dragon’s heart. I avoided the claws and wings, and with all my strength, I thrust the hilt into it.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The altar has been retaken!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The blessing of the goddess is lifted!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Kang!
 </p>
 <p>
  [This monster is physically immune!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The shattered sword blade flew into the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  I tossed aside my sword with only the hilt remaining. The Black Dragon crouched down, shooting scales. A shattered shield lay beneath its feet. I grabbed it and quickly retreated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud! Thud! Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  Using the remaining half of the shield to block the scales, I retreated to the main base. The dozens of shadows concealed their presence.
 </p>
 <p>
  I spat out the saliva mixed with blood and asked, “What happened?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It looks like soldiers appeared behind the altar,” Neryssa said.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the left wall. Close to a hundred soldiers were swarming around the altar. The white light that had surrounded them had returned to its original crimson hue. Behind them, the second party stood motionless on the ladder, with soldiers relentlessly climbing up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The altar has been reclaimed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist raised his sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  The white light surrounding the sword faded away.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis swallowed a groan.
 </p>
 <p>
  The soldiers didn’t rush the second party, but they surrounded the altar, aiming their weapons. In an instant, the balance of power had shifted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We need to break through, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis said bitterly.

 <p>
  [Human Soldier Lv.18] x 115
 </p>
 <p>
  [Human Knight Lv.20] x 32
 </p>
 <p>
  There were about 150 soldiers at the altar. And their numbers were increasing.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the other hand, their party had suffered casualties, with Asher and Diran dead. Among the surviving members, none were in top condition.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s like what happened on the fifth floor.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna chuckled awkwardly.
 </p>
 <p>
  I let out a deep sigh.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s no way to get through unscathed.”

  “What should we do? Reclaiming the altar…”

 <p>
  “Forget it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I reached out my hand to Velkist.
 </p>
 <p>
  He furrowed his brow. “What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Give me your sword.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist handed me his longsword.
 </p>
 <p>
  I said, “It’s not over yet.”

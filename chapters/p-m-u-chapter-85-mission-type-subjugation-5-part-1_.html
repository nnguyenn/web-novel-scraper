  “Han, let’s give it one more try!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis shouted from atop the ramparts.

 <p>
  I shook my head. Their formation had crumbled when Asher and Diran died. Just the fact that the three of them were still alive was a stroke of luck.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you do that, you will die, stay put and watch.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If we don’t go…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll finish this on our own.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis bit her lip, her head bowed.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t the fault of the second party. We were just one step short of having a good third party, which would have made dealing with the creature much easier.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘In the end, it’s a gamble.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I pointed my blade at Eloka.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ignite the flames.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The white flames in your hand. Use it on my blade.”
 </p>
 <p>
  White flames danced in Eloka’s right hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the blessing attribute fire that Eloka had drawn out before the altar was occupied.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Try infusing it with elemental power. You can do it, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll mix in some telekinesis energy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka took a deep breath and extended the flames from her palm to the sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sizzle. The sound of burning wood accompanied the white flames merging with the blade.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just once. If we amplify this, I can use magic only once.”

 <p>
  Eloka looked at the remaining embers in her hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That should be enough.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do we do now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Grur…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The black dragon knelt, drawing closer.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shadows emerged from its scales, gathering around it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t let them lay a finger on Eloka.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa handed Velkist a dagger.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist accepted the dagger.

 <p>
  “Oppa, stay strong!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No need to say it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled and readied my sword, dispersing the white flames into a circular pattern.
 </p>
 <p>
  The flames on the blade wouldn’t last long. If the creature was still intact by then, we’d be done for.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This time, it ends!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  I kicked up sand as I surged forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  【La Gran Inpegyo.】
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka began her casting.
 </p>
 <p>
  I charged. My target was the spot where the ballista had pierced through.

 <p>
  “Grr…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The creature lowered its wing.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So you caught on it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed to have sensed my intent to aim for its weak point.
 </p>
 <p>
  With its right wing shielding its injuries, the creature thrashed with its claws and tail. I brought my sword down.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang!
 </p>
 <p>
  Claws and blade met, and white flames erupted.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No immune message appeared.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I drew my poisoned dagger.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, I cut the opposite side of the weak point with the fiery longsword. Scales tore, and black blood spurted. Simultaneously, I struck the other side with the dagger in my left hand.

 <p>
  “Argh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The black dragon thrashed wildly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Wings, teeth, tail, and claws – it swung them all around. Rocks beneath the sand scattered like debris. After stepping back, I observed its rear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwshh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka’s entire body was ablaze.
 </p>
 <p>
  Heat emanated, swirling like a whirlwind.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Back away from Eloka!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The three who had formed a triangle around Eloka retreated a few steps.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Deal with the shadows. Don’t let them get close!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes!”
 </p>

 <p>
  Flash.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka’s eyes flashed blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  The flames around her intensified.
 </p>
 <p>
  The black dragon’s gaze shifted toward Eloka.
 </p>
 <p>
  It blinked before curling into a ball.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…It’s coming.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I hastily sheathed my sword and positioned myself in front of Eloka.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dozens of spines shot out from the stretched body of the black dragon. Their target was Eloka.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kagagang!
 </p>
 <p>
  I swung my sword wildly. If that wasn’t enough, I used the dagger. And if that wasn’t enough, I’d take the hits with my body. Thigh, shoulder, ribs, calf – the scales pierced my body like paper.

 </p>

  My vision swayed.
 </p>
 <p>
  I clenched my teeth. My staggering body regained its composure.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you okay?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry about me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘These damn scales.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Blood trickled from the pierced areas.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thorns protruded from the scales, designed to induce bleeding if removal was difficult.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kraaa!”

 <p>
  The black dragon raised its head towards the sky and let out a deafening roar.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the same time, its body turned crimson. Red-black veins became vividly visible throughout its body.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Warning!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Half-Black Dragon Halkyrap’ has entered a berserk state!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The black dragon stared at me and swung its right hand at an incredible speed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  I dodged. The fierce shockwave resonated in my eardrums.
 </p>
 <p>
  The floor, swept by claws, split apart like tofu. As soon as I withdrew, the left-hand claw came crashing down.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Frenzy!’
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★★)’ has entered a Frenzy state!]
 </p>
 <p>
  A hot surge rushed through my mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  The sword and claw clashed.
 </p>
 <p>
  I felt a pressure as if my body would shatter. The ground I stood on caved in. The black dragon’s muscles writhed. Its tail swung at an unseen speed. Instinctively, I blocked it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack!
 </p>
 <p>
  A sound like a toy breaking echoed, and Velkist’s sword shattered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Neryssa, a sword!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Shua!
 </p>
 <p>
  The rapier slid across the ground, smoothly transferred. I immediately caught it. White flames flickered from the broken blade and transferred to the rapier’s blade.

 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  The rapier couldn’t withstand three strikes and shattered.
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned around and shouted, “Throw everything you have!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I transferred fire to my left-handed dagger.
 </p>
 <p>
  The dagger broke in two strikes. Jenna’s dagger flew immediately after. A flurry of attacks followed. Deep footprints were carved into the ground. Eloka was behind me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I swung the dagger.
 </p>
 <p>
  The black dragon’s right claw flew off.  Every bone and muscle in my body creaked. My vision turned red.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then…
 </p>
 <p>

  The black dragon’s right claw flew off.  Every bone and muscle in my body creaked. My vision turned red.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then…

  [The Hero’s Soul is Awakening in a Critical Situation!]

 <p>
  [Skill Awakening!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★★)’ has acquired the ‘Invincible’ skill!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★★)’ has leveled up ‘Frenzy’ by two levels! It’s now level 6!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Take this too!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist’s dagger was handed over.
 </p>
 <p>
  I transferred the flames and discarded the broken weapon. Wings flapped. I dodged and leaped over the creature’s knee. Holding its wings firmly with my left hand, I drew my right-handed dagger down.
 </p>
 <p>
  Szzzzz!
 </p>
 <p>
  The skin was shredded.
 </p>
 <p>
  It felt like carving into bones.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Rrrrgh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the black dragon’s wings was severed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The fallen right wing on the ground flapped as if it were still alive.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is not bad.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I became faster and stronger.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the scales and skin became softer, enough to be cut with a dagger.
 </p>
 <p>
  So it was possible. I chuckled and applied pressure with my hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  The black dragon crawled towards Eloka.

 <p>
  Its tail lashed out like a whip. I avoided it. The distance between the black dragon and Eloka was less than 5 meters. The creature suddenly crouched down.
 </p>
 <p>
  I rushed forward and climbed onto the black dragon’s body like a ball.
 </p>
 <p>
  I thrust the flaming dagger into the creature’s long neck.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud.
 </p>
 <p>
  I grabbed the hilt of the dagger with both hands and sliced through the neck.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Rrrurrruck!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “SHUT UP!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The black dragon’s posture unraveled in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  I used all my strength and plunged the dagger into its neck.
 </p>
 <p>
  The leather and muscles supporting the neck tore apart, and

  Nearly 1 meter around, the black dragon’s head flew into the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Achievement Unlocked!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★★)’ has acquired the ‘Dragon Slayer’ skill!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwooosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Black blood spewed like a fountain from the severed neck.
 </p>
 <p>
  The creature thrashed wildly, swinging its tail and claws.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Frenzy has been released for ‘Han (★★).’ ]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★★)’ has entered a state of extreme fatigue. All attributes have decreased by 90%.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Strength was drained from my body.

  As the blind claws descended to crush my head, Jenna swiftly leaped in and pulled me back. Instantly, the claws struck where I had been.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoosh. Fwoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  The blood spewing from the black dragon’s neck intensified.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the black dragon was still moving.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So you won’t die until we burst its heart.’
 </p>
 <p>
  “You filthy bastard.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I muttered as Jenna handed me a potion.
 </p>
 <p>
  My entire body was drenched in blood. I couldn’t tell if it was mine or the dragon’s.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Senior, I have a question.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist spoke up.

  I looked around. The shadows were almost cleared. The only thing left was the black dragon, missing its neck and wings, thrashing about. Eloka’s chant was nearing its end.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you even human?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist wore an indifferent expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is the first time in my life that I have seen a human stand up to a dragon and tear its throat out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What are you talking about?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I collapsed onto the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  If I hadn’t gained Invincible at that moment, I wouldn’t have been able to move. As I coughed, the blood I had swallowed came pouring out.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Luck was on my side.’

  Skill Awakening.

  My Frenzy level increased, and I gained Invincible, a skill suitable for the situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  My body had no strength left.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had no strength to even move my fingers. I took a deep breath. The area where the scale had pierced throbbed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you okay, Oppa? Do you want me to remove the scales?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t pull them out; it might worsen the bleeding. Just keep your distance from that thing. And take me with you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna dragged me away from the black dragon.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka’s spell was complete.

  [Inflare. Combine.]

 <p>
  Tier 4 fire magic.
 </p>
 <p>
  The entire black dragon’s body turned white. The flames consuming its body gathered near its heart, forming a circle and undulating. Gradually, it grew.

  A small sun was forming.

 <p>
  The sun swallowed the black dragon whole, growing to a certain size, and then vanished.

 <p>
  Pop!

 <p>
  A white flash spread across the entire field.

  [Now, Master, you’ve graduated from being a novice too. We’re all very moved. Please continue to enjoy Pick Me Up and have fun!]

 <p>
  [A lower-level dungeon has been unlocked.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The second exploration dungeon, ‘Halsea,’ is now open.]

 <p>
  [Additional facilities have been unlocked. Please check the instructions.]

 <p>
  [There are heroes waiting for promotion among the Master’s heroes. If you have the materials, combine them, and reclaim the fragments of forgotten memories!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The 20th-floor field disappeared in succession.
 </p>
 <p>
  The soldiers on the castle walls turned into particles of light and disintegrated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Amidst this, I looked at the messages that kept appearing.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ding!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The dimensional rift is ready to be opened.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “No one died.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “None of us.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist chuckled at Jenna’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  We were enveloped in light. I got up with Jenna’s support. The scales fell off by themselves, and the bleeding stopped. My vitality gradually returned.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Take care of Eloka. Her recovery is slower.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna walked over to Eloka, who looked dazed.
 </p>
 <p>
  For a moment, the light flashed so brightly that we found ourselves back in the rift of space and time.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sighed lightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned my shoulders and it moved without any difficulty.

  “All that’s left is…”

  I surveyed the circular room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Party one five people. The second party has three members.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was over.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Fifteen went, eight returned.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa’s expression darkened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The third party was wiped out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t complete annihilation, but it was a significant setback for sub-party development.
 </p>
 <p>
  The same went for the second party. Edis looked gloomy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis, who had been hesitating, approached me.

  “Han, I’m sorry. We couldn’t do our job properly…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you talking about? Thanks to you, we made it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I patted Edis on the shoulder and whispered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Take care of the party. Don’t let it fall apart like this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Hum.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis, along with the other two members, left through the rift of space and time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Only five members from the first party remained. Eloka, who had collapsed, leaning on Jenna. I stored the recovered shield, sword, and dagger and said,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Great job, everyone. Rest tomorrow. Do whatever you want.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I want to fight with you tomorrow, senior.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You should be quiet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  We exited to the first-floor plaza.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle flew over, sprinkling stardust. Something familiar rested against my chest.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The ‘Warhorse Statue’ was gifted to ‘Han (★★)’!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle exhaled.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her white cheeks were tinged with red.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Great job on the 20th floor! You were awesome. This is a Master’s gift to our Dragon Slayer, God Loki!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t need it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I scratched my cheek.

  [Master, the promotion begins!]
 </p>
 <p>
  When I opened my eyes, I found myself inside a house.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-1" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 </div>
 <p>
  The sight inside the room was familiar. I had seen it before. It was the shabby house I saw during the 2-star promotion. It had a crude, wooden structure.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There was a woman holding a baby back then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  That woman was not visible now.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, in one corner of the room, someone crouched and shivered. I could only see their back. Judging by their physique, it seemed to be a young boy. I reached out my hand, but as expected, an invisible barrier blocked me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this happening again?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I clicked my tongue.
 </p>
 <p>
  The young boy with black hair crouched and murmured.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mom… Dad…”
 </p>
 <p>
  *Thud!*
 </p>
 <p>
  I forcefully pushed aside the invisible barrier.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s annoying.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t understand why it was showing me this.
 </p>
 <p>
  Leaving the boy alone, I surveyed the surroundings. I saw a door on the right wall. I grabbed the doorknob, but it was locked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “When I opened this door and went out last time…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I met that woman.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a very unpleasant and dirty experience that I didn’t want to go through again. Anyway, unless that door opened, there was no way out of here. I sat on a rocking chair in the corner and crossed my arms, waiting. The boy called for his parents with trembling voices, but I didn’t pay him any attention.
 </p>
 <p>
  About ten minutes passed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The darkness outside the window engulfed the entire room, and a message announcing the completion of the promotion appeared.
 </p>

 </p>
 <p>
  [Congratulations, Master!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The forgotten memories of the hero have awakened.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★★★),’ promotion complete! It has become 3 stars.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Illustration updated.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Level and skill cap increased.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hero’s class change is now possible.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Darkness enveloped my body.
 </p>
 <p>
  After returning to the red magic circle, I left the Synthesis Chamber. Iselle was nodding off on the bench.
 </p>
 <p>
  I smacked Iselle’s forehead.
 </p>

 <p>
  With a strange groan, Iselle’s eyes opened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, how long have I been inside?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle wiped the wet corners of her eyes and fluttered her wings.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked around and then said,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s talk in my room. There are quite a few prying eyes here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tsk, how annoying!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle hopped onto my shoulder.
 </p>
 <p>
  I contemplated whether to brusher her off, but I decided not to. On my way back to the lodging, a summoning message appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, starting a 5-consecutive summon. Looking forward to which heroes will come out!]
 </p>
 <p>
  *Ta-kak, doo-roo-roo-roo.*

 </p>
 <p>
  [Master ‘Anytng’…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is he replenishing the ranks?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dica, who was in the training camp, walked out to the entrance of the summoning chamber.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dica also had the role of a trainer and was responsible for the education of the newly arrived recruits.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you think it’s okay not to go? If you’re busy, it’s fine even tomorrow.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s fine. The screening will start from tomorrow.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Diva addressed the newcomers with an encouraging tone.
 </p>

  Various reactions were received. It seemed that they would undergo at least minimal training before the deployment tomorrow. I walked through the lobby and entered my room. Iselle descended from my shoulder and perched on the desk.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s start right away. Open the window.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Before that, there’s something I want to tell you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle revealed a mischievous smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The reason I was surfing the web wasn’t just for fun. I was also trying to help, Loki. I searched for various information that could be helpful in my own way.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “So?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do you want to hear it? Do you want to? It’s a very special report, my master!]
 </p>
 <p>
  I reluctantly agreed. Iselle raised her index finger.
 </p>
 <p>
  [First one! Anytng joined Ragnaroki.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm?”
 </p>

 <p>
  [Ragnaroki. I told you about it before. The nationwide Loki Association. The Master of Masters’ number one fan cafe!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Goosebumps ran down my arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  I placed my hand on my forehead.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, you’re saying that Anytng joined the fan cafe?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Of course! Hehe, that guy also realized the greatness of Loki. What else can he do? The Heavenly Scroll he received… Ugh, that lucky guy. I want one too…]
 </p>
 <p>
  I ignored Iselle’s sparkling eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s not entirely useless.’
 </p>
 <p>
  This way I can confirm that Anytng has developed a liking for me.
 </p>
 <p>
  This would be a significant plus factor in correcting the master’s gameplay. Although I wasn’t particularly pleased, I spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s the second one?”
 </p>

 </p>
 <p>
  I held my breath.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle raised her index finger along with her middle finger. Then she said.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Neifheim has resumed recruiting members.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Recruiting members?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. The conditions are level 20 and 3 stars or higher. Basically heroes from Server 2 who are approaching their class advancements.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Show me the details.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Iselle opened her palm, a hologram window appeared.
 </p>
 <p>

  There was no need to look at it.
 </p>
 <p>
  I waved my hand, and Iselle closed the window. Iselle placed her hand on her hip and blew air out of her nose.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Isn’t it funny? Loki is right here. Where is this impersonator coming from?]
 </p>
 <p>
  I placed my hand on my chin.

  There were quite a few things to think about.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Still, aren’t you surprised? I thought you’d be flabbergasted.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I know how the internet is. There’s nothing that can’t happen there.”
 </p>
 <p>
  But there were still some surprising things.
 </p>
 <p>
  First, the fact that Pick Me Up’s heroes could interfere with the Master’s system. I was clearly here. However, the author of the post was Loki. The authority of the sub-master, which I thought was just a simple substitute, seemed to be more powerful than I thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  The second was the conditions for the training service.
 </p>
 <p>
  It matched perfectly with our current situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s almost like…’
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s calling for me.

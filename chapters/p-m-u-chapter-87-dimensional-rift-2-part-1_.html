  “It’s been a while since Niflheimr posted something like this. Let me see… Five months.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, five months in Earth time!”

  Iselle folded her palms together, wearing a puzzled expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But the real Loki is here, isn’t he? Who’s the one posting this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I pondered this carefully.
 </p>
 <p>
  Without me, there are two candidates who could inherit the authority. First is Seris, who holds the top rank, and second is Yurnet, who’s in second place. After considering who among them would be likely to do this, I came to a conclusion.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s Yurnet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The reason would become apparent when I went there myself.
 </p>
 <p>
  This service, which accepts Heroes from other waiting rooms for training after dimensional openings, was a method I used back when I was renovating the facility a long time ago. It was a massive construction project, and no matter how many Gems I had, it was insufficient. Thus, I had to bring in people from other places to get more Gems. Of course, there were other reasons as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  After some stabilization, it was immediately closed down.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had no intention of reopening it, but at this point, the service was reopened, and it was tailored to my current situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What should we do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle looked at me with an anxious gaze.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We should apply.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The number of comments is enormous. The competition rate is over 100 to 1. Will the master even apply? It costs 500 Gems.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Didn’t Anytng join Ragnaroki?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle nodded her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That settles it then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng joining my fan cafe meant that he knew my identity from the documents I sent. Furthermore, he was following my strategy up to this point. It meant he was quite invested. Controlling him wouldn’t be difficult.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Open the window. Let’s compose an email.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Got it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle sat down in a chair, closed her eyes, and brought her index fingers to her temples.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Haaap! Fairy power!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A window appeared before us.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t it different from last time?”
 </p>
 <p>
  […]
 </p>
 <p>
  Anyway, we didn’t have much time. I quickly entered the email section.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no reply from Anytng. I didn’t know if he had nothing to say or if there were other reasons. I pressed the send button after composing the message.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There are three things we need to convey.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The first was to open a dimensional rift and leave a comment on Niflheimr’s post for recruiting new residents in the Dimensional Cafe. It didn’t matter if the competition rate was 100 to 1 or 1,000 to 1. Comments on the recruitment board were kept private, visible only to the author. So, I would write something there that only Niflheimr heroes would know.

 </div>
 <p>
  “Done with that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The second message was about Anytng’s current gameplay.
 </p>
 <p>
  The advice was simple.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do some paid gacha.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It was good to raise lower-ranked heroes. Even without me, we could acquire talents like Jenna, Velkist, and Neryssa. However, relying solely on them would be foolish. Lower-ranked heroes had potential, but it paled in comparison to higher-ranked ones. That was a clear fact.
 </p>
 <p>
  One more thing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Focusing on developing lower-ranked heroes only paid off when a proper system was in place. Throwing them into the training grounds without a plan was not the way to go. We still needed the power of higher-ranked heroes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Analyzing the 20th-floor process, I concluded that having advanced heroes mixed in the second party and third party would have made it much easier.
 </p>
 <p>
  The last message was important.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t blindly trust my strategies.”
 </p>

  The operation of the waiting room needed to be adjusted according to the situation. There would come a time when you had to judge on your own rather than relying on my strategies. While using them as a reference was fine, depending too much on them hindered your own growth. I wrote this down at the bottom, and then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Send.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When I touched the button, a message appeared saying the email was sent.
 </p>
 <p>
  I pressed the X button several times and exited.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s done. You can turn it off now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Click.
 </p>
 <p>
  The window disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle wiped the sweat from her forehead.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s already done? We could have done a bit more.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She seemed to be feeling quite enthusiastic now, despite initially pretending to be dead.

 <p>
  “You can use the rest.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle approached me eagerly.
 </p>
 <p>
  I stood up from the chair.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were certainly some things I could do.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was curious about the state of my body on Earth. Was it destroyed, or had I become a plant person lying in a hospital? I also wanted to contact other masters in a cooperative relationship with Niflheimr.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It can wait.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I decided to do those tasks once we had a solid foundation here.
 </p>
 <p>
  By then, a long-term regime on the internet would likely be possible. I pushed Iselle, who was trying to stick to me, and left the room. Although there would be a rest period after the 20th floor, I couldn’t afford to relax.
 </p>
 <p>
  I went to the 2nd-floor plaza.
 </p>

  After spending so much time there, Edis came out of the storage room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis, who spotted me, narrowed her eyes tiredly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come with me for a moment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I said.
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis nodded as she tilted her head and followed me.
 </p>
 <p>
  We entered the restaurant and took a seat at a table where no one’s gaze would reach.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you get some sleep?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Her eyes were somewhat puffy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis sighed deeply without saying a word.
 </p>

 <p>
  ‘This girl is stressed too.’
 </p>
 <p>
  There were three possible reasons for this. First was the occurrence of two deaths in the party. Second was the failure to defend the shrine. Given Edis’s personality, she couldn’t help but feel responsible. The third was…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The insane difficulty level.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled.

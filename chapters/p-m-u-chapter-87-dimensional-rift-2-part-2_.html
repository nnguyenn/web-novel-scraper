 <p>
  There were three possible reasons for this. First was the occurrence of two deaths in the party. Second was the failure to defend the shrine. Given Edis’s personality, she couldn’t help but feel responsible. The third was…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The insane difficulty level.’

 <p>
  I chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the countless missions, only the crazy ones seemed to get selected. As that bi*tch had claimed, the internal difficulty of Townia was at an S-level, almost on par with Niflheimr.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What about the morale of the members?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They’re fine. Aaron seems to be training more than before. He’s currently practicing in the training grounds. On the other hand, the 1st-floor kids…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis grimaced.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They turned their backs on combat because the entire Third Party got wiped out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The survival rate is low, huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. Some people think it’s better to just eat potatoes than fight and die.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I clenched my fist.
 </p>
 <p>
  Due to the low survival rate, another problem had arisen. The imbalance in hero ratios. Starting from the next mission, I needed to consider the survival of sub-parties as well. Of course, before dealing with that issue…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Proper education and experience are needed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The third party had never experienced a boss stage.
 </p>
 <p>
  The absence of experience was the trigger for their complete defeat. We needed to improve the Regeneration Stone farming and the training facility to make it more useful. Anytng would handle the construction.
 </p>
 <p>
  I conveyed this information and the solution to Edis.
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis, who had been listening quietly, mumbled, “You’re something else…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nothing. I just feel that you’re amazing. You know everything, your instructions are precise, your judgments are cool-headed, and your combat power is incredible. You almost single-handedly took down the dragon. It was beyond common sense.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis let out a bitter smile.
 </p>

  “Compared to you, I’m just a small fry. At first, I thought I could be of some help, but somehow I feel like I’m drifting further away… AUGH!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I stepped on Edis’s foot hard.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s with the unnecessary nonsense? I’ve said it before, I can’t do it all by myself.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I understand. I’m sorry.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll be gone soon. About a month.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If we convert 10 Earth days to the waiting room, it’s about a month.
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis blinked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “A month? Are you going on an expedition or something?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, I’m going farther. Until then, please take care of this place. There will be quite a bit to do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If Anytng follows my advice, advanced heroes will enter this waiting room.

 <p>
  To fill the vacancies in the second party and take charge of the core in the third party. I explained this possibility to Edis, who nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, you want me to take charge?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right. Don’t cling to me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But seriously, where are you going…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m going to a different waiting room.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis had a question mark on her face.
 </p>
 <p>
  I realized I needed to explain this as well. I chuckled and said, “We’re not the only ones here. There are other masters and heroes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After finishing the explanation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis was unable to utter a word for a moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……100 million? There are 100 million places like this?”
 </p>

  “They only say 100 million. In reality, it’s not even half of that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, no matter what…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Among them, there are at most ten that directly engaged with us. There is no need to worry.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edith cupped her forehead.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I feel like… I’ve come to an incredibly different world. Anyway, I get it. I’ll try what you told me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I trust only you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I got up from my seat, walked past Edis, and placed my hand on her shoulder.
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis nodded slightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng didn’t take long to end today’s play.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then, he didn’t log in for a while. I organized the results of the battles at the training ground.

  ‘A 2-level increase in Frenzy, and Invincibility, and Dragon’s Blood; Dragon Slayer.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The ability bonus obtained from using Frenzy had increased to nearly 10.
 </p>
 <p>
  Immortality had the effect of delaying abnormal status effects such as poisoning, confusion, and bleeding.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was one of the recommended support skills for heroes who used Frenzy since it added immunity to abnormal states on top of increasing combat power.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Dragon Slayer…’
 </p>
 <p>
  It granted bonuses when facing Dragonkind.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a special skill that could only be learned through achievement rather than training. It seemed that the system had given me an achievement for delivering the finishing blow to the dragon.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If I had known this, I would have gone out to fight.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist clicked his tongue in the training ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, we would have ended up with the trouble of clearing one more corpse.”

  Neryssa teased.
 </p>
 <p>
  The two of them laughed and entered the practice area. And after a few more days, the intensity of that boss battle was forgotten.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Welcome to Pick Me Up!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng logged in.
 </p>
 <p>
  He quickly skipped through the emerging announcements and events and went straight to the detailed menu. Then, he went to the help section under miscellaneous items and searched for the “Dimensional Rift.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [What is the Dimensional Rift?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘The Dimensional Rift’ is a special facility where you can enjoy external content of Pick Me Up. It is only open to masters level 20 and above, and there is no additional cost.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Subcategories – Dispatch, Expedition, Event… ]
 </p>
 <p>
  [※Notification!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [When you open the Dimensional Rift, you can access the Dimensional Café on the right side of the main screen. In the Dimensional Café, you can interact with other masters.]

  [※Caution!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [When you open the Dimensional Rift, you will be assigned dimensional coordinates. In addition, the first-tier protection of the waiting room will be lifted. Be careful as you may be exposed to invasions by other masters! Master decide carefully!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tips/Dimensional coordinates are coordinates within the current server’s waiting room.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tips/You can choose not to open the Dimensional Rift if you prefer solo play.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng closed the help section and returned to the main screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, he touched a gray icon that was shining white. The icon had the words “Dimensional Rift” engraved on it. I left the room and headed to the 2nd-floor plaza.
 </p>
 <p>
  In front of the plaza.
 </p>
 <p>
  Light was seeping through the tightly closed doors.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, opening the Dimensional Rift.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Are you sure you want to proceed? Once opened, it cannot be undone!]

  [Yes (Selected) / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang!
 </p>
 <p>
  The door leading to the Dimensional Rift shook vigorously.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Asking once more. Are you sure?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes (Selected) / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  When Anytng touched ‘Yes,’ Iselle popped out and sprinkled stardust.
 </p>
 <p>
  [He chose to open it as expected.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle had a complex expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Opening the Dimensional Rift is not a good thing.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll be able to do more than we can now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s true. Then I should go all out, right?]
 </p>
 <p>
  After Iselle took a light breath, she reached out her right hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  A mass of light extended from her hand and clung to the closed door.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Open, Dimensional Rift!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  The door leading to the Dimensional Rift opened.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Finally.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Messages kept popping up in my field of vision.

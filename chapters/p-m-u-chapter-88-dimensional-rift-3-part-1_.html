 <p>
  [Tips/Recovered heroes are not as powerful as before. Consider synthesis or transformation…].
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned my attention away from the messages.
 </p>
 <p>
  I knew what it said. There was no need to read it further.
 </p>
 <p>
  I walked through the open door.

 <p>
  Inside, a cool breeze greeted me.
 </p>
 <p>
  After stopping at a suitable spot, I examined the dimensional rift.
 </p>
 <p>
  My initial impression was that this facility was enormous. It was different from the spherical rifts I had seen before. It was a straight-line chamber stretching over 100 meters in length. The ceiling soared high as well. The reason was clear. This facility itself was a storage warehouse.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, for the smooth use of external content, ‘Airship Processing’ is required!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Airships consists of four components: Body, Engine, Dimensional Core, and Blueprint. You can assemble them to create an airship. Additionally, to operate an airship, a Magician is required.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Airships.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if the dimensional rift was open, it couldn’t be used properly without ‘airships.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Since Anytng is at level 20, the difficulty of crafting and operating an airship is challenging. Practical use would likely require reaching higher levels.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Pick Me Up!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Welcome to the Dimensional Cafe!]
 </p>

 <p>
  Nevertheless, I opened the dimensional rift.
 </p>
 <p>
  ■ Dispatch Bulletin Board
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;※Caution!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;This is where posts related to dispatch…&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The purpose was as expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as Anytng entered the Dimensional Cafe, he headed straight to the Dispatch Bulletin Board and started searching for Loki’s post. After a while, a comment was added to the recruitment post for Niflheimr Training Services.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So we’re doing it?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the dead-end of the dimensional rift.
 </p>
 <p>
  It had a radius of about 10 meters. Gray light spiraled in a helical pattern, forming a dimensional gate. When I tried to touch it, it felt like an invisible wall was blocking my hand. It seemed to be in an inactive state.
 </p>
 <p>
  Observation was over.
 </p>

 <p>
  I exited the dimensional rift. The door closed silently.
 </p>
 <p>
  [※Notice!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Evacuation Guide for Enemy Intrusion!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, please set up an evacuation route in preparation for invasion. Heroes who cannot engage in combat will evacuate through the designated route when enemies invade.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tips/The dormitory is an inaccessible area for intrusion.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A cross-section of the waiting room appeared in Anytng’s control panel.
 </p>
 <p>
  It must have felt a bit overwhelming. Opening the dimensional rift had brought various inconveniences. He would be busy for a while. I cleared the control panel from my sight and entered the training grounds.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang! Clang clang!
 </p>
 <p>
  The sound of metal clashing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the sparring area, Velkist and Aaron were facing off with their weapons.
 </p>

 <p>
  “This combination is rare.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Apart from the two of them, the training grounds were empty.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took a seat and watched the fight.
 </p>
 <p>
  The outcome didn’t take long. Velkist’s sword pierced through Aaron’s defense and reached his neck.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems the odds are against you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist’s gaze outside the training grounds rose.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had spotted me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What brings you here? I heard you were resting.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even if I told you to rest, you still train.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Staying still makes me itch.”

 <p>
  Velkist wiped his sweat with a towel and took a sip of water.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you here to teach me a lesson or two, Senior?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have no business with you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist lightly clicked his tongue.
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned my attention to Aaron, who was walking out of the training grounds.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aaron.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, Hyung-nim?”
 </p>
 <p>
  He seemed unaware that I had come.
 </p>
 <p>
  I nodded and said, “I have something to discuss. Follow me.”
 </p>

 <p>
  Aaron looked puzzled but obediently followed.
 </p>
 <p>
  I left the training ground with Aaron and headed back to the dormitory. When I opened the door to the lounge next to it, I saw an unfamiliar scene.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna’s hand placed a knight on the chessboard.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka’s face showed disappointment.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sat down on the couch next to the table.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s chess here too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you know this game, Oppa?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna asked as she organized the black pieces.
 </p>

 <p>
  “I didn’t know it, and neither did Eloka unnie. We found it out of boredom. There’s even an instruction manual. It’s called chess, apparently.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You didn’t know! Isn’t that a lie? Then how do you explain the ten-game winning streak!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, come on. How would I know living in the forest? It’s my first time today. Oh, by the way, isn’t that Aaron Oppa behind you…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna looked at Aaron over my shoulder as she spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have something to say to both of you. This place seems suitable. Nobody’s around.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But I’m here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You shouldn’t be here, right? I believe it’s your study time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, well…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sweat appeared on Eloka’s forehead.
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled and settled into the couch.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just kidding. Just give us a moment alone. It won’t take long.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “All right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka quickly left the lounge.
 </p>
 <p>
  As I made myself comfortable, Aaron sat next to Jenna.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s going on? Why did you call us here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How much baggage do you have? Personal items. Things like Eloka’s fan or outerwear.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t really have much. Besides weapons.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t have many possessions either.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then you’re in luck.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I continued speaking.

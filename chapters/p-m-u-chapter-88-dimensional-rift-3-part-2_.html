 <p>
  “Then you’re in luck.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I continued speaking.

 <p>
  “Get ready to leave this place.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The expressions on both of their faces momentarily froze, then turned to shock. Jenna stood up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oppa, you don’t mean we’re finally leaving this place…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sorry, but no. We’re just going to another waiting room.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I explained to them just like I did with Edis.
 </p>
 <p>
  Listening to the explanation, Jenna and Aaron’s expressions changed rapidly, but in the end, they nodded in understanding. Afterward, I added that Anytng had sent a deployment request to another master’s waiting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, the three of us are going to another waiting room?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right. It’ll be for about a month. We’ll train in the facilities of the other waiting room and come back. It’ll be a valuable experience.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wouldn’t it be better for someone else than me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron’s face darkened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Didn’t you want to become stronger?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, but…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you going or not? If you don’t want to, I can replace you with Velkist.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After a brief hesitation, Aaron steadied his voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I’ll go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Requesting Aaron’s participation through mail was also a burden for me.
 </p>

 <p>
  It had no merit for Anytng.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But he still agreed.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The three heroes Anytng requested to participate in the comments are,
 </p>
 <p>
  Me, Jenna, and Aaron.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Should we prepare right away?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, it’ll take about a week.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Recruitment would end tomorrow in Earth time. The announcement would be two days later.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was about a week left in waiting room time. We couldn’t depart right away. Jenna and Aaron didn’t meet the recruitment criteria.
 </p>
 <p>
  I checked both of their stat screens.
 </p>
 <p>
  Both were at level 19, with their experience bars nearly full. With a few more rounds on the 19th floor, they would reach level 20. There were spare promotion tickets as well. There was plenty of leeway.

  “Anyway, I understand. We’re going to another place in a week, right? This is starting to excite me a bit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna got up from her seat.
 </p>
 <p>
  After patting Aaron’s shoulders once, she left the lounge. She seemed to have realized that there was something I wanted to discuss with Aaron separately.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the lounge, with just the two of us left, Aaron spoke up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hyung-nim, about the Niflheimr you mentioned last time…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right. It’s the place we’re going to.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I took a deep breath.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll stay a month there. But for you, Aaron, it might not be a month. You may not be able to return here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron didn’t respond.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The instructor position is vacant. Dica can’t handle it alone. You have another option besides fighting. Yet, are you determined to walk the difficult path?”

 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron finally spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright. There’s nothing more to say then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Be prepared. You either become stronger there or there’s a high chance you won’t make it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ask Edis to give you the permission to leave the party. Your training won’t be done in a month. It’ll take a year.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It takes that long?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you think you’d become strong in a snap of your fingers and come back?”

 <p>
  I chuckled and stood up from the couch.
 </p>
 <p>
  After roughly tidying up the chessboard on the table, I stuffed it into a drawer. Chess. Maybe it would be okay to play it when I have some free time. I didn’t know why it was here in the first place.
 </p>
 <p>
  Time passed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis accepted Aaron’s departure request. Returning could take more than a few months, or he might not be able to return at all. There was no option other than acceptance.
 </p>
 <p>
  The preparations for meeting the conditions also began.
 </p>
 <p>
  19th floor. The members were me, Edis, Eloka, Jenna, and Aaron. It was a mixed composition of two parties.
 </p>
 <p>
  The 19th floor was slightly more difficult than the 18th, but the analysis was already complete. Two of them quickly reached level 20. Promotion proceeded smoothly. After extracting the soul stones, Anytng immediately evolved them into 3-stars. I decided not to ask what memories they had seen.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then, the announcement day.
 </p>
 <p>
  The list of candidates included Anytng’s account name.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was an unbelievable condition. They applied for not one, but three. Yet, they won with a probability of over 100 to 1. It couldn’t be a coincidence. I confirmed my hypothesis here.

 <p>
  ‘This recruitment event is related to me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Furthermore, they have information about me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Otherwise, they wouldn’t have matched the conditions exactly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s convenient.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I saved myself the trouble of finding them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once the announcement was confirmed, I called the other members of Party 1.
 </p>
 <p>
  After the explanation, Velkist spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you leaving this place for a long time?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you going to train somewhere else to become stronger?”
 </p>

 <p>
  I nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist’s expression turned displeased.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why am I not on the list?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why not me!” Neryssa joined him too.
 </p>
 <p>
  I said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll let you all go when the time comes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Niflheimr’s training service had a good reputation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although it was for the sake of obtaining Gems, I took it seriously. The nearly 20,000 application comments were the proof. There were negative reviews about the service, too, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Listen to Edis carefully, especially you, Velkist.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you worried so much?”
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-12" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  Velkist chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not just worrying. I don’t have the slightest doubt.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa grinned.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist drew his sword. I kicked Velkist’s right hand and the sword went spinning, sticking into the table.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you guys ten-year-olds?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I sighed involuntarily.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anyway, don’t cause trouble until I come back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you sure you’ll come back?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you mean?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is there a possibility of changing affiliation?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist sheathed his sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  His face was expressionless.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He’s hitting the mark.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not like it’s not there.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry. I don’t have that intention.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It definitely exists in Pick Me Up.
 </p>
 <p>
  How to change a hero’s affiliation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Niflheimr has expanded by supplying and recruiting talent through various methods other than its own summons.

  ‘It’s a change of affiliation.’

  I have no intention of doing that.

 <p>
  Not yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  I swallowed the rest of my words.
 </p>
 <p>
  And again.
 </p>
 <p>
  A few days later.
 </p>
 <p>
  A message appeared on the master’s screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  [※Notification!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Niflheimr’ affiliate, ‘LandGrid07,’ demands a port call.]

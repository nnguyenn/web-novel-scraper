 <p>
  I placed the file in the drawer and locked it.
 </p>
 <p>
  I picked up my sword and shield leaning against the wall. The clock showed 8:27 PM. Anytng was still connected.

  [Master, another account is requesting a dimension transfer!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The account will land in this waiting room momentarily. Do you accept?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes (selected) / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Opening a dimensional rift for the account ‘Landgrid07’!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Captain ‘Misikas (★★★★★)’ is requesting a trade with the master.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Request – 1,500 gems]
 </p>
 <p>
  The exchange window appeared on Anytng’s control screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a demand for payment for training services in Niflheimr. Soon, a leather pouch containing blue gems appeared in the exchange window.
 </p>
 <p>
  I left the room, glancing at the screen out of the corner of my eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was nothing else to take apart from my equipment. Niflheimr would provide everything I needed. As I walked out, I encountered Jenna and Aaron in the corridor.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you ready?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m ready.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I am too, Hyung-nim.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  They had no special equipment. Just a bow, a spear, and a few daggers.
 </p>
 <p>
  We left the accommodation together. The dimensional rift was open beside the door in front of the second-floor plaza. Some familiar faces were visible near the open door.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you going now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis and Roderick.

  “It might get boring.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We will be waiting.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even Velkist, Neryssa, and Eloka.
 </p>
 <p>
  All the combat heroes on the second floor were gathered in one place.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s quite a send-off.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t cause any trouble. This sort of thing will happen more often from now on.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sending heroes off to places other than the waiting room wasn’t uncommon. Right now, almost all the heroes were stuck here, but as we climbed higher and more dimensions joined, there would be specialized parties responsible for the outside.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You said one month, right? Are you sure?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can’t guarantee it. It could be delayed or expedited.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “I’m worried. What if you end up in a different place?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka pouted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You can do some research while I’m gone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, well…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Edis, keep an eye on her. She tends to slack off when I’m not around.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Without the core members, the ascent would be delayed. There were several tasks that had piled up inside. I had already told Edis about the points where heroes needed to assist the master. Even the auxiliary members came to say hello, after exchanging greetings with each member, the heroes left one by one.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stay safe.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally, Edis, the last one remaining, extended her hand to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  We shook hands. I felt strangely awkward.

  Jenna, who had been watching Edis, spoke up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll come back, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry about unnecessary things. Just go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  We entered the dimensional rift.
 </p>
 <p>
  A straight corridor stretched out in front of us. In the middle of our leisurely walk, Iselle appeared with a familiar light.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Han, heeey!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle’s eyes were swollen and red. She was wiping her eyes with a white handkerchief, her voice quivering.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I heard a strange rumor! That you won’t come back from Niflheimr? This is not true, right?!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who’s spreading such nonsense.”
 </p>

 <p>
  [Yeah, right?!]
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like the rumor had spread.
 </p>
 <p>
  I shook my head and took a step forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry. I’ll bring him back safely.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna reassured Iselle, putting her arm around her.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Really? He can’t get stolen! I trust you! If those guys take him, it’s over! They’re a bunch of thieves. Corporate tyranny…]
 </p>
 <p>
  I pulled Iselle’s cheeks.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m sorry for being tyrannical.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Oh, no! I’m not talking about Loki… … Anyway, come back. Promise me!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle held out her little finger.
 </p>

  If I refused, she was ready to burst into tears.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Her nose was completely red.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I put my hand on my forehead.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I pinky promised her, Iselle’s tear-soaked face brightened.
 </p>
 <p>
  [So you promised this. You will definitely come back!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, so stop whining.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Then, I will wait.]
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, Iselle became light and disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron laughed lightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hyung-nim is probably the only person the fairy would treat like that.”

 <p>
  We continued down the straight corridor.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the dead end of the dimensional rift, something unusual came into view.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was about 20 meters in size. It was a sleek, black, ship-like entity with golden decorations of a mountain goat on the bow. It was a Landgrid series, a Niflheim airship model.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow, isn’t this cool?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna grinned.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you know airships?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, I heard about it from my dad. He said there were ships flying in the sky.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve seen them before too. Although I couldn’t ride one since it’s an aristocrat’s exclusive.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed that even in Townia, the concept of airships existed.
 </p>

 <p>
  Well, without such a concept, you wouldn’t be able to find Heroes engineers. I took a step forward, and the distance gradually closed.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Confirm your identity!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Somewhere in the airship.
 </p>
 <p>
  A woman’s voice echoed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you Han Israt, Jenna Shirai, and Aaron from Townia?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Confirmed. Ejecting the entrance. Please come up carefully.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Clank.
 </p>
 <p>
  A staircase descended after a mechanical sound from the ship’s railing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems different from what I’ve seen.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is it a more recent model?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It looks like it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron smiled bitterly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I stepped onto the staircase leading to the airship.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, the dispatch begins!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dispatched heroes – ‘Han (★★★)’, ‘Jenna (★★★)’, ‘Aaron (★★★)’]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Region – Niflheim (101.***.***.***)]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Type – Training]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Duration – 10 days]

  [※ Caution!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [From the moment the dispatch is sent, the affiliation of the hero will temporarily change to ‘Niflheimr.’]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do you accept?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes (Selected) / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  The exchange process was over.
 </p>
 <p>
  The whirlpool of dimensions behind the airship began to shine blue. As I set foot on the first step of the railing, a girl in a black uniform approached.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Welcome! I’m Lydel, your guide to Niflheimr.”

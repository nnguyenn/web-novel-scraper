  “Welcome! I’m Lydel, your guide to Niflheimr.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hello…?”

 <p>
  Jenna’s awkward greeting made Lydel smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  I surveyed the airship’s deck.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was nothing particularly noteworthy. The main material was metal. Apart from the lack of sails, it wasn’t significantly different from the appearance of a ship.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But it flies in the sky.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Several people were on the deck, their curious gazes fixed on us. Lydel cleared her throat and straightened her neck.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Landgrid 07. Boarding complete. Departing.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The voice rang out as clearly as if it were on a loudspeaker.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A wizard.’
 </p>
 <p>
  One per airship.
 </p>
 <p>
  To ensure proper mobility, they needed a class higher than a mage – a wizard. Although they were affiliated with Niflheimr, I couldn’t pinpoint who exactly it was. With hundreds of wizards in their possession, I didn’t memorize them all.
 </p>
 <p>
  Vrooom.
 </p>
 <p>
  A strange sensation of floating enveloped my entire body.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna and Aaron, who had been standing on the deck, were surprised. It was clear that they were experiencing riding an airship for the first time. I laughed and leaned against the railing. The airship, about 3 meters above the ground, began to move slowly towards the dimensional vortex.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this normal?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna asked with a hint of anxiety.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the opposite side, a pair of men and women chuckled. When I glared at them, they turned their heads.
 </p>
 <p>
  “As long as you don’t die, stay quiet. Don’t make it obvious that you’re a country bumpkin.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, alright.”

 <p>
  The whirlpool of dimensions began to swallow the bow.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Beep!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Niflheimr’ affiliated airship ‘Landgrid 07’ is departing.]
 </p>
 <p>
  At some point, the entire ship became hazy, and when the light faded, the airship was flying in the unfamiliar sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The wind brushed against my cheek.
 </p>
 <p>
  First, I saw clouds. At an altitude of at least a thousand meters.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I looked down, a familiar sight caught my eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s…”
 </p>
 <p>
  A desolate land with no blades of grass growing, as far as the eye could see.
 </p>

 <p>
  Even from a distance, it was recognizable. It was Townia after its destruction.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked back.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the distant horizon, a circular tower soared. The lower part of the tower was buried underground, and the upper part was obscured by clouds.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Was it like this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The whirlpool we had just escaped from in the middle of the sky swayed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron, who had been leaning out of the railing, spoke, “This is amazing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He had no idea where this place was.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m sure this is normal to you, Hyung-nim.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Enjoy the view as much as you want, I’m going inside. We’ll arrive in two days.”

 <p>
  There was a staircase in the middle of the deck.
 </p>
 <p>
  I left the two of them behind and walked up the stairs. A message appeared at the top of my field of vision.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dimension 1935 – Townia]
 </p>
 <p>
  “The system is visible even here,” I thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  The status window also appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  This place seemed to be firmly within the pick-me-up zone as well. I yawned and entered the cabin.
 </p>
 <p>
  As I entered the sleeping quarters and lay on the mesh bed, Lydel’s voice reached my ears.
 </p>
 <p>
  I opened my eyes halfway. It seems that we wouldn’t be going straight to Niflheimr. There would be quite a few other guests to transport besides us.
 </p>
 <p>
  Landgrid 07 transported guests through various dimensions.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were heroes of other masters who had won the heroes’ recruitment. The total number of guests on the airship, including us, was 20. The remaining guests would be transported through other airships.

 <p>
  “There are so many strange places.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna muttered from the assigned cabin.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ours was a desolate land, but there were places split into pieces, places on fire, and places covered in water. What in the world is this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, do you know about any of this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna was shaking on the mesh bed.
 </p>
 <p>
  She seemed tired of looking outside.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Dimensional Leap about to begin! Be careful not to fall!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  I felt a tingling sensation deep within my body.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a signal announcing the dimensional leap.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s about time.”
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  I got up from the bed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Through the narrow window, a familiar landscape was visible. A volcano constantly spewing lava, sulfur clouds obscuring the sky, floating islands scattered throughout. It was the same field I had seen when I regenerated the 80th floor of Niflheimr.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dimension 1106 – Niflheimr]
 </p>
 <p>
  I was sure now.
 </p>
 <p>
  I picked up the weapons I had left leaning against the pillar.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Beep! Alert to passengers on board. The airship will soon arrive at its destination. Please come out onto the deck.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Lydel’s voice echoed.
 </p>
 <p>
  I opened the door leading to the corridor.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where’s Aaron?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He said he rented an empty warehouse for training. I’ll call him!”
 </p>

 <p>
  He’s quite diligent.
 </p>
 <p>
  I shook my head and walked out into the corridor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Passengers inside the ship were moving towards the staircase. They came in all genders and attire, but they all carried weapons. I merged into the crowd and stepped out onto the deck.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t lean out over the railing! It’s dangerous to go outside the protective barrier!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Amidst the bustling crowd, Lydel shouted while waving a fluorescent rod.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll arrive in about 5 minutes. There may be some shaking during the docking process, so please hold onto the nearby bunk tightly!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oppa, I brought you… huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna’s eyes widened.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron, who was next to her, had the same reaction. Both of them were staring blankly at their surroundings.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘These two…’
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  I chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  A few other people had similar expressions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dozens of dimensional whirlpools were spread out in the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  Large and small airships were flying in the vicinity of the whirlpool. There were at least thirty of them by a rough count.
 </p>
 <p>
  Zoom.
 </p>
 <p>
  A massive object passed by next to the airship we were on.
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t gauge its size exactly, but it was roughly around 5,600 meters.
 </p>
 <p>
  This airship was of such a scale that it made the others look like tiny specks.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What… What is this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna pointed to the airship next to us.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our view was completely blocked by the size of the airship.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s Sigdripha 01. It’s a battleship capable of carrying 37 combat airships. The airships you see beside it are dedicated escort ships. They’re called Trude 03, Trude 18…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Small airships were being sucked into the hangar at the bottom of the battleship.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s not for combat.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sigdripha model had been retired from combat purposes since the 60th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lydel explained one by one about the dozens of airships flying in the sky. Jenna ran her hand through her red hair.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t understand even a word of what he’s saying.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I understand roughly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;In any case, everyone.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Lydel finished her explanation and smiled.

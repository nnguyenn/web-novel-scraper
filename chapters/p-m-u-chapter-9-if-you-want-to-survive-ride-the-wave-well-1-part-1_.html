 <p>
  The next morning, I came out to the square.
 </p>
 <p>
  Silence. The air was cool.

 <p>
  There was no one in the square.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Where did she go?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I clicked my tongue. After confirming that Jenna went to the dorm first, I followed her, but she was nowhere to be found. I was willing to compromise on the sofa.
 </p>
 <p>
  But not the bed.
 </p>
 <p>
  It doesn’t matter, she wasn’t there anyway.
 </p>
 <p>
  The training camp was open. If I had trained my mind for the past week, now it was time to move my body. I walked into the training camp.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Training Camp Lv.1]
 </p>
 <p>
  Approximately 50 pyeong in size.
 </p>
 <p>
  (T/N: A
  <strong>
   <em>
    pyeong
   </em>
  </strong>
  (abbreviation py) is a Korean unit of area and floorspace, equal to a square kan or 36 square Korean feet.)
 </p>
 <p>
  Straw-made scarecrows were standing here and there. On the corner shelves were practice weapons such as wooden swords, spears, and shields. Other than that, it was empty, but it was just a Level 1 training camp. That alone was impressive.
 </p>
 <p>
  I started running along the walls of the training camp.
 </p>
 <p>
  Breathe in lightly twice, and exhale deeply once.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a simple technique I learned in the military. I ran like that for 10 minutes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Running at a steady pace, my calves didn’t hurt and I didn’t feel short of breath.
 </p>
 <p>
  I opened the status window.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Han Iselle (★) Lv. 5 (Exp 44/50)]

 </p>
 <p>
  Pathetic.
 </p>
 <p>
  I frowned. The growth rate per level is only 4. Why does intelligence keep increasing? It’s a useless stat for a physical type.
 </p>
 <p>
  But even so, it was clear that my body in this world was superior to my body on Earth. After my discharge from the military, I hardly exercised and I was always out of breath just climbing a few stairs because I always drove.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was a representative sample of modern people with a lack of exercise.
 </p>
 <p>
  But now, it felt like I had returned to my military days.
 </p>
 <p>
  To strive for the top warrior.

  “This world is different from Earth.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The ramen on the shelf and the orange juice in the refrigerator would be replenished even if you ate and drank as much as you wanted, and when you opened a drawer or a closet after thinking about something, the item would appear. Of course, there are no K-2S or AK-47s.
 </p>
 <p>
  The things you can get are everyday items like clothes, pencils, and toilet paper.
 </p>
 <p>
  After running for 30 minutes like that, my body felt fine and I started doing push-ups.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now I understand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sometimes there are heroes who show different combat abilities from others even though they are in the same grade.
 </p>
 <p>
  One thing they have in common.
 </p>
 <p>
  They don’t neglect training.
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t know in the early days. Even though they trained, I thought their stats and levels won’t increase, so I wondered why do they keep training so hard in the training camp. But still, I kept upgrading the facilities because I thought it was admirable that the game characters put effort into it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking back now, it seems like they weren’t game characters.

 <p>
  Anyway, their efforts paid off, and as their level increased and their grade changed, they gradually stood out.
 </p>
 <p>
  I defined it as “constitution.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Building tall buildings requires a solid foundation.
 </p>
 <p>
  1-star heroes start with basic stats of 10. Strength 10, Intelligence 10, Stamina 10, Agility 10.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether it’s a well-fed middle-aged woman or a grandfather who works today and tomorrow, their physical abilities would be the same. But the results are different.
 </p>
 <p>
  “First, mentality.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Heroes who easily fall into fear or panic are not worth the effort.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ability to remain calm in any situation and find a way to victory is what you need.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s why the “combat logic” that makes this possible is recognized as an S-rank passive skill.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Second, skills.”

 <p>
  The second criterion for distinguishing gemstones is skills.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some heroes are good at using swords, while others are good at using spears. Each hero has a different talent for weapon skills. Higher-ranking heroes are usually summoned with their talents already developed while lower-ranking heroes are hidden and the master has to help them find their hidden talents.
 </p>
 <p>
  I still don’t know my skills. I will have plenty of opportunities to find out. I decided not to be anxious.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Third, physique.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s what I’m doing right now.
 </p>
 <p>
  So to summarize it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  Skills.
 </p>
 <p>
  Physique.
 </p>
 <p>
  When these three elements come together, I will have the competitiveness to compete with 5-star heroes.

  I know from experience, heroes like that are real monsters.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once they have that mindset of improving nothing will stop them.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you doing?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I heard a familiar voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  I stopped doing push-ups and stood up. As I looked at the entrance of the training camp, Jenna, with her red hair tied down, was looking at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I said, “I’m training to take down monsters. Why?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why is your tone so aggressive? And to think that I’ve been looking for you since morning.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna grumbled as she entered the training camp. Then she fiddled with the longbow stored in the barrel.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, I’ve been thinking all night about what to do from now on. It’s true that we can’t leave this place, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t answer.

  Jenna took out the longbow and pulled the bowstring.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let me join too. I’ll be useful.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What can you do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even though you know, you’re still being hostile. Well, even if it looks like this, I’m good at shooting arrows. It won’t be a hindrance. My father was a hunter, so shooting arrows in my spare time was a hobby.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna held a wooden arrow from the barrel and quickly shot it. With a shallow popping sound, the arrow hit the scarecrow 10 meters away.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Crying and complaining won’t change the situation, I figured out this much. Hyung, you know how we can survive, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You, was yesterday your first real fight?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course. I’ve been stuck at home.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How well can you shoot a bow?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Decently.”

  Jenna shot another arrow.

 </p>
 <p>
  The growth rate is low at 4, but instead of intelligence, agility increased by 2 points. Moreover, she has a pre-existing skill for a 1-star hero.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the three who ran away, she was the only one who returned.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was her first real battle, and although she was scared, she didn’t succumb to panic and successfully shot and killed a goblin. There was no hesitation caused by the deaths, and she had a clear goal and knew what to do next.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s an opportunity.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I recalled yesterday’s battle. Three people ran away even though I handed them weapons. If the next ones are also the same cowards? Can I handle the next stage alone?
 </p>
 <p>
  I need to survive before competing.
 </p>
 <p>
  I answered, “Fine. I’ll help you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please take care of me, hyung.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna smiled and extended her hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  I shook her hand.

  “Next.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The next in line was me.
 </p>

 <p>
  Eldarkin examined me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “….”
 </p>
 <p>
  He moved his lips but stopped.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eldarkin’s short eyebrows furrowed.
 </p>
 <p>
  After a while.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Excellent.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A gruff voice came out.
 </p>
 <p>
  The hand of the young man holding the pen stopped.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s going on?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You need to look at it too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sure, let’s have a look. Level 20 and…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The young man’s eyes widened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eldarkin said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s your name?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Han Israt.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Affiliation?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t it written in the ledger?”
 </p>

 <p>
  “My apologies. Give me the ledger.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eldarkin received the ledger from the subordinate and scanned its contents.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Birth grade is 1 Star. Affiliation is Townia. Are you sure?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  The deputy’s complexion turned pale.
 </p>
 <p>
  “A monster like this… 1 Star at birth.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Monster, he said.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Do you say that when you see a person?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I clicked my tongue.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You stay here. Step aside.”

 <p>
  Aaron was looking at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eldarkin returned the ledger to the deputy and said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have something to tell the recruits separately. Sorry, but stay here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I moved aside.
 </p>
 <p>
  There happened to be a metal chair there, so I sat down.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since I was near the end of the line, the examination ended quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The warrior aspirants followed the guidance of the deputy and exited the back door of the auditorium.
 </p>
 <p>
  Except for me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eldarkin and I were the only ones left in the auditorium.
 </p>

 <p>
  Eldarkin looked at me in the chair and chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You seem comfortable already.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why did you leave me behind?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I reported your information to the higher-ups. The commander-in-chief is coming soon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I wasn’t particularly surprised.
 </p>
 <p>
  Niflheimr has communication capabilities. It should be possible to see from a distance. Eldarkin, who was looking at me from a floating posture, said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Han Israt, from Townia. Is that correct?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Already confirmed information.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no need to answer.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The commander-in-chief will be here within a minute. I’ll take my leave.”
 </p>

 <p>
  Eldarkin quickly left the auditorium.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was left alone.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What an odd feeling.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Facilities and heroes that I had touched and managed, actually exist and are alive.
 </p>
 <p>
  I remember. That Eldarkin Brach was a 1 Star hero who panicked and did nothing in his first battle. The video from that time is also saved. It would be quite funny if I played it back. That man, who was in charge of so many instructors, was trembling at first.
 </p>
 <p>
  “….”
 </p>
 <p>
  I put my hand on my sword hilt.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They’re coming in openly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I felt a strong presence at the entrance of the auditorium.
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally, a woman in a uniform appeared at the entrance. She crossed dozens of meters in a single step and approached me. It was Training Camp Commander Eclet.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  “I’ve received the report. Are you Han Israt?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eclet scanned me from top to bottom with her blue eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  A hint of suspicion crossed her eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Quite remarkable.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Any particular reason for you to come to see me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You didn’t come to see me for a recruitment proposal, that’s for sure.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I said, placing my hand on the hilt of my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eclet’s lips curled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right. I didn’t come here to recruit you.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “To interrogate me, I assume.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When I revealed my affiliation, Eldarkin’s lips twitched strangely.
 </p>
 <p>
  Next, Eldarkin summoned the commander. No matter how promising I might be, they wouldn’t bring out top-tier individuals just to recruit one recruit.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You know it well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In an instant, Eclet’s hand disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  I instinctively drew my sword, but the blade came flying faster than that.
 </p>
 <p>
  A trickle of blood flowed from my throat.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘As expected, not good enough.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I sheathed my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  The difference in specs is too severe.
 </p>

 <p>
  “You’re excellent, but you still need time. You can’t beat me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I get it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s get to the point.”
 </p>
 <p>
  While Eclet’s blade was at my throat, she spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Speak willingly. Where did you hear that information?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What information?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you asking because you don’t know?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Life sparkled in Eclet’s eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How did you know that Lord Loki disappeared?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “More precisely, your master knows. Anyway, tell me the source of the information and everything else you know if you want to go back alive.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Is this how it is?
 </p>
 <p>
  What I told Anytng, the information that needs to be included in the recruitment comments, is that Loki is not in Niflheimr. Anytng, who doesn’t know the details, may not understand the meaning, but the situation is different for the affiliated heroes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if the lower-ranking heroes don’t know, the high-ranking officers should be aware of my disappearance.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was surprising that the training camp commander knew the content of the recruitment comments.
 </p>
 <p>
  I raised my head.
 </p>
 <p>
  The obstructed ceiling. But that guy’s eyes are everywhere in Niflheimr.
 </p>
 <p>
  I lowered my gaze. Eclet was staring at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s your identity?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The blade dug in slightly.
 </p>

 <p>
  I was about to speak, but I sighed instead.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Boring.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Offering excuses.
 </p>
 <p>
  Deceiving others with nonsense different from the truth.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’m tired of the mundane play.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you want to know who I am?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come out, Yurnet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;As you command.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Fog swirled from one side of the auditorium, and a white shadow walked out.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-15" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  The fog gathered into the shape of a person.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eclet’s eyes widened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A plain white robe with no adornments. Wavy white hair reached down to the waist.
 </p>
 <p>
  Second in command of Niflheimr.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurne Seed knelt on one knee before me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I greet the Master.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You knew but came out late.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please forgive me. I was preparing to receive you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I pushed the blade against my throat with my fingertip.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then I said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I am Loki.”

  “Nislade, bring tea and snacks.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”

 <p>
  The girl approached expressionlessly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Pleased to meet you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She bowed to me and left the garden with an empty teapot. In less than 10 seconds, she returned with a tray containing snacks and the teapot.
 </p>
 <p>
  After Nislade went back to the entrance, I said, “Don’t you guys disdain me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you mean?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I didn’t think it would be unreasonable to get stabbed as soon as I arrived.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t raise heroes and operate the waiting room out of affection. I thoroughly examined efficiency and value, and if they fell short, I dropped them, and if they excelled, I promoted them. All the welfare facilities here were for combat efficiency and stress management, not built with heroes’ benefits in mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet, who had been listening, smiled faintly. “You’ve used us as chess pieces in the long run.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where is the resentment or not? Master never discriminated against us, always gave us opportunities, and led us to victory with sound judgment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet gently touched the flower bud on the table.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If it weren’t for Master, our Niflheimr would have rotted away long ago. Me, and everyone else.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…,” I remained silent.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That alone qualifies you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If she thinks so.
 </p>
 <p>
  I might find it hard to understand, but there’s no need to argue if she believes it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anyway, it’s an honor to meet you like this, Master Loki. I’ve been looking forward to this day. You’re as dignified and magnificent as I imagined.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet stood up from her chair and offered her greetings once again.

 <p>
  I took a sip of tea. It felt quite unfamiliar.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s late tonight. I’ve prepared a mansion for you on the 13th floor, so please stay there, and come back tomorrow morning. I’ll call Ridgion as well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A mansion? So you even thought of that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve prepared a place only for Master. It’s right in the center of the 13th floor.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked up at the sky. It was a grayish black with some streaks of gray.
 </p>
 <p>
  Observationally, the evening had passed. Jenna and Aaron would probably be preparing to spend the night in the dormitory of the training camp.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m fine with the dormitory at the training camp.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet tilted her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have no intention of sleeping in the mansion.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The meaning is….”

 <p>
  “I was once a master, but not anymore. There is no need to treat me so kindly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I drank all the tea.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So you’re going back to the second floor?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I prepared everything diligently… even a welcome party…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A welcome party?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Observing all the victories Master has achieved…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s an embassy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Too bad.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet said.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Anyway, I understood Master’s intention well. Since you are nominally a trainee in Townia, you want to be active on the second floor, right? It seems we’ll have to go down to the second floor…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t bother to come.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then how will I be of help to Master? I have a lot to say and tell…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “After training schedules. When it’s free time. We can meet then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Free time is given in the evening.
 </p>
 <p>
  It won’t take a while to meet Yurnet then.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet, who had been contemplating, brightened her eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master, how about this? After sending all the recruits back…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Rejected.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “We’ll replace all the instructors. Those with bad habits…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Rejected.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The dormitory at the training camp is small and plain. Can we renovate it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t do that either.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The facilities at the training camp are quite excellent, at least compared to Townia’s current ones.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It doesn’t suit the Master’s dignity,” Yurnet expressed her dissatisfaction with a frowning face.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was taken aback and said, “Where do you see dignity in me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can see it. An aura of an emperor surrounding the Master…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can you see it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I asked Nislade, who was standing a distance away.
 </p>

 <p>
  “I’m not sure.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That settles it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Yurnet chuckled forcefully, Nislade took a step back.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t get carried away.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “And don’t reveal my identity to the others either. I don’t want to be tied down. Just let them know I’m alive.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “As you command.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet bowed her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s discuss this further tomorrow evening.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood.”
 </p>

 <p>
  I got up from my chair.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll open a door discreetly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Yurnet’s gesture, a dimensional portal veiled in mist appeared in one corner of the garden.
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the portal, I could see a corridor. It was the corridor of a training camp annex that accommodated recruits. Before I stepped through, I said, “Yurnet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ve done well without me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Niflheimr is still intact.
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t see every place, but I could tell that much.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sub-master is Seris. But Yurnet is in charge of overall operations. She must have had busy days handling tasks I couldn’t do.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s an honor.”
 </p>

 <p>
  Yurnet greeted me, holding the ends of her skirt.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have one last question.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is the current me still Master to you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet smiled lightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment, the garden shook violently.
 </p>
 <p>
  Leaves and petals scattered in all directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where is the Master! Yurnet!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A man’s voice could be heard from afar.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet smiled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ridgion seems to have noticed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I swear didn’t say a word!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thunk!
 </p>
 <p>
  A second vibration.
 </p>
 <p>
  The space that surrounded the garden began to distort.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They’re breaking the barrier.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did Ridgion have such a temperament?”
 </p>

 <p>
  I thought of him as someone who never blinked, even if all his comrades fell.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Among us, he’s the one who searched for the Master the longest.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you plan to meet him?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I shook my head.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rank 3. There’s a lot to discuss with Lydel.
 </p>
 <p>
  But it won’t be settled overnight.
 </p>
 <p>
  I planned to create a place after I had a clear understanding of the situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We don’t have time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Nislade said.

 <p>
  “Ridgion is usually calm, but once he gets excited, it’s hard to stop him.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I stepped into the dimensional portal.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mist enveloped my body, obscuring my vision.
 </p>
 <p>
  Murmurs.
 </p>
 <p>
  Voices of people chattering echoed.
 </p>
 <p>
  I surveyed my surroundings. In a wide circular space, tables and sofas were spread out. Recruits dressed in various outfits were engaged in conversations.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the reception room of the annex.
 </p>
 <p>
  Next to it, there were rooms for recruits to stay in.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They’ve placed me here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though I appeared right next to them, no one seemed to find me strange.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like a blend of illusion magic.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The third floor of the training camp annex.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna and Aaron should be here somewhere.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you’re looking for your companions, it’s this way,” Nislade pointed to the stairs.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why did you follow me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “For the safety of you master.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry. If anyone lays a hand on you, I’ll break their necks.”
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s exactly what I’m worried about.

 <p>
  The next day.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I opened my eyes, I saw a strange ceiling.
 </p>

 <p>
  I recollected my memories.
 </p>
 <p>
  This place was on the 5th floor, among the annexes that accommodated recruits.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the highest floor of the annex and had notably fewer rooms. The reason for the scarcity of rooms was simple; it was reserved for the instructors.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Yurnet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Originally, I had been assigned to the 4th floor. However, due to an unknown fire in the room, I was forcibly moved here. This room was at the end of the corridor on the 5th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  I roughly tidied up the bedding and got up.
 </p>
 <p>
  The room was clean and neat. The bed, desk, and wardrobe gleamed as if they were brand new.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They really did well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked around elsewhere, but it wasn’t like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  It felt like someone had turned the room upside down.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you there?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Knock, knock.
 </p>
 <p>
  A knocking sound resounded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Excuse me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Nisled entered, opening the door.
 </p>
 <p>
  She bowed to me and then glanced at the bed briefly. Silently, Nisled adjusted the pillow and blanket to perfection.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is there anything uncomfortable about staying here? It’s quite plain. If you wish, you can go to the 13th floor…”
 </p>

 <p>
  “It’s fine.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I picked up the sheathed sword and shield on the desk.
 </p>
 <p>
  I spoke to Nisled, who stood upright in the corner of the room.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You didn’t reveal my identity, did you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course not. You said you didn’t want any disturbances.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Nisled lowered her head to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I understand. If it were known that you were Lord Loki, it would cause a commotion in Niflheimr.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It wouldn’t be that big of a deal.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What a sad thing to say.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Click.

 <p>
  After securing the last strap of my armor, I opened the door.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I will proceed with my mission.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Nisled’s body blurred and soon disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the highest-ranked skill of covert movement. Nisled possessed the ability to erase her presence completely.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Annoying.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I had strongly resisted her company, but I had no choice but to agree due to Nisled’s warning that there would be trouble if she didn’t follow orders.
 </p>
 <p>
  The condition was not to disclose my identity to ordinary heroes and to conceal her own appearance. The first one had no problems until now, but the second one is actually easy. Contrary to appearances, Nisled was a Master Assassin and a 6-star maximum level. She was a formidable warrior ranked within the top 100 solely by pure sequence.
 </p>
 <p>
  I walked out into the corridor.
 </p>
 <p>
  The instructors were chatting in the lounge.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our eyes met, but I ignored them. When I descended to the 4th floor, I could meet the two who were waiting.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Oppa, you’re here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna shook my hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron, standing beside her, nodded his head to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you get some sleep?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The lodgings are better than ours. Thanks to that, I slept well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I slept well too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘His complexion doesn’t look good despite saying he slept well.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled at Aaron’s face.
 </p>
 <p>
  He must be thinking a lot. Who I am, how I knew about Niflheimr, and what will happen to him. I had nothing to say at this moment. There would be a chance later.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked around the reception room.
 </p>

 <p>
  In addition to us, other recruits were gathering and chatting.
 </p>
 <p>
  The main topic of conversation was Niflheimr.
 </p>
 <p>
  Admiration for the size and facilities of the waiting room. Eclet’s statement that top performers would be placed in Niflheimr. And rumors about Niflheimr that they knew. Jenna, who was watching the two girls gossiping, spoke up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We talked with the other girls yesterday, and they said this place is amazing. There are a lot of people, the facilities are great, and there are many strong people.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna whispered to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Recruits who aren’t even part of this place know about Niflheimr.
 </p>
 <p>
  Information about this place seemed to be more widely spread than I thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Most importantly, they say this Niflheimr has never lost before?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who said that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just everyone was saying that.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “I’ve heard that story too. They say They’re invincibles.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron added.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Never lost.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I had failed in missions many times.
 </p>
 <p>
  As I pondered, I realized.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Are they talking about something other than missions?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Maybe they’re talking about battles between masters.
 </p>
 <p>
  If that’s the case, I couldn’t deny it.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was true, after all.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Many seem to want to get into Niflheimr.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “You mean by becoming the top-ranked trainee, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. They say there’s no worry about being synthesized or dying on missions. The welfare is perfect, and the evaluation of contributions to the public is excellent. They don’t discriminate against people from other places either.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked around at the other recruits once again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not a hundred percent, but hope was evident in the expressions of many recruits.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How about you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s just talk, right? Of course, we have to go back. Our comrades are waiting.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I feel the same way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The two’s answers were without hesitation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, they would. They had a purpose to go back.
 </p>
 <p>
  Recruits who were making reluctant faces probably had similar reasons.
 </p>

 <p>
  “The question is whether it will go as we wish.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Entering Niflheimr or returning to our original places wasn’t a guaranteed option just because we wanted it. Eclet’s condition for offering lordship was to be in the top 3.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ninety-seven people would be left out. Even if they wanted it, they couldn’t stay Niflheimr.
 </p>
 <p>
  The second case was when top rankers didn’t want to receive lordship.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sometimes, this happened. But 99% of the time, ends up in Niflheimr anyway. By that time, negotiations would have already concluded, and the master would sell that hero to Niflheimr.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jenna might end up like that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  This girl’s talent was exceptional.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had no intention of leaving her here though.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Following the guidance of the instructors, we gathered in the first-floor hall of the annex and headed to the cafeteria.
 </p>
 <p>
  After finishing our meal in the cafeteria, the first class awaited us. If yesterday was for enrollment and room assignments, today marked the beginning of real education.
 </p>
 <p>
  We entered a large building across from the annex.
 </p>
 <p>
  We repeated the process of climbing stairs and passing through corridors. Once the large iron door opened, we arrived in a room with a high ceiling and rows of desks. I immediately realized.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s a classroom.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The recruits settled in as if they found it fascinating.
 </p>
 <p>
  After confirming the number of attendees, all the other instructors left, leaving only Eldarkin.

 <p>
  I opened my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  The second morning in Niflheimr.

 <p>
  The room’s appearance had become somewhat familiar.
 </p>
 <p>
  I drank the lukewarm water placed by the bedside.
 </p>
 <p>
  After tidying up, as I got up, I heard a knock at the door.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Have you woken up?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Excuse me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Nisled entered the room and began arranging the bedding.
 </p>
 <p>
  She straightened the pillow and folded the blanket. It was the same scene as yesterday. I put on my sword and shield and said,
 </p>
 <p>
  “How long are you going to follow me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Unless you have other orders, I’ll stay here as long as you do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Nisled finished her tidying up.
 </p>
 <p>
  From her words, it seemed that Nisled also knew that I wouldn’t stay here for long.
 </p>
 <p>
  I recalled yesterday’s events.
 </p>
 <p>
  After I finished speaking, Yurnet quietly withdrew, saying she understood.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no resistance or objections. My decision remained unchanged.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I will strengthen myself.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if I were to accept Yurnet’s proposal one day, it would only be after I had confidence in myself. I wouldn’t rely on them completely, even if I could accept their help.
 </p>
 <p>
  I put on the detachable leather armor hanging on the rack.

 <p>
  It was 6:35 AM. There was still time before classes started. I thought about borrowing the courtyard of the annex for some sword practice. It had been a while since I had moved my body.
 </p>
 <p>
  I intended to walk past Nisled, who was standing there, somewhat stunned.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then…
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I discovered a strange scene.
 </p>
 <p>
  A cluster of mist was gathering above the bed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The hazy mass coalesced into the shape of a person in one spot. It gained color and definition. It was my own figure.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s going on?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;I determined that it’s pointless for the Master to attend unnecessary lessons.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet’s voice echoed.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  &lt;The current lessons will proceed according to the knowledge the Master possesses. There’s no need for you to be there if you don’t wish to.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The figure that looked like me stood up from the bed.
 </p>
 <p>
  I touched its calf with my toe. I could feel it. Yurnet’s specialty, a tangible illusion magic. From the outside, no one would be able to tell the difference.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you setting up my stand-in?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Yes. I mixed in a few spells. Even a colleague won’t be able to tell.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Click.
 </p>
 <p>
  My illusion sheathed the sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;If the Master decided not to stay, shouldn’t they make the most of their time here? Please give us orders.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re waiting for your approval, Master.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Nisled spoke up.
 </p>

 <p>
  I narrowed my eyes. She wasn’t wrong. I would have to spend more than half of my day doing nothing if I followed the class schedule. I thought for a moment and nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Very well, you have my approval.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Thank you, Master.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  My clone passed through the door.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though it acts somewhat unnaturally, Yournet’s illusion creates a psychological illusion in the viewer’s eyes. There was no worry about being caught.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master, what do you plan to do from today?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Nisled asked.
 </p>
 <p>
  One month of free time and my plans were already set.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Personal training.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Here, I didn’t need to worry about mission progress or the situation in the waiting room.

 <p>
  I planned to rent a suitable place and focus on training. My goal was clear.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Level up my intermediate weapon skills.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Currently, my weapon skill level is at 8, the lower tier. With two more skill level-ups and a promotion, I would meet the evolution conditions. I didn’t care about anything else. Just this. There was a significant gap between lower and intermediate weapon skills.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If possible, I’d like to borrow the backyard of the annex. Is that okay?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You should have your meal first.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A dimensional door opened in the corner of the room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Beyond the door was a familiar scene. Yurnet’s residence, the Mist Garden. I hesitated for a moment and then nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I won’t use this door. I’ll go there myself.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;As you command.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The dimensional door closed.
 </p>

 <p>
  At the same time, a cool sensation enveloped my body. I knew what it was. It was magic that concealed my appearance.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Nisled, please guide the Master.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Nisled opened the door.
 </p>
 <p>
  We stepped into the corridor of the annex and began walking.
 </p>
 <p>
  The instructors passed us by as if they hadn’t seen us.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll take a look around at least once.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Niflheimr.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s a place I designed and created. While it might be challenging to explore every location due to time constraints, I intended to see as much as possible. You don’t know something until you’ve seen it with your own eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  We entered the corridor leading to the elevators.
 </p>

 <p>
  A group of people in gray uniforms came into view. A black-clad instructor led them in front of the group.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They must be from the Main Hall.”
 </p>
 <p>
  These were heroes freshly summoned from Niflheimr’s summoning hall.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were in a state of continuous production. Heroes kept getting summoned even in my absence. Newcomers underwent basic assessments, were assigned to training centers based on their aptitude, graduated, and were then categorized based on their abilities.
 </p>
 <p>
  We reached the central hall on the second floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  I saw elevators going up and down through glass corridors. People dressed in various colors were inside. Nisled pointed to the door on the right side of the hall.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Master should go this way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The door, painted black, had golden patterns on it.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a passage reserved for high-ranking officials. I followed Nisled inside, and the elevator began to move.

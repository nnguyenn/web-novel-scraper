  “The Master should go this way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The door, painted black, had golden patterns on it.

 <p>
  It was a passage reserved for high-ranking officials. I followed Nisled inside, and the elevator began to move.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike regular elevators, there was hardly any vibration.
 </p>
 <p>
  I observed Niflheimr’s scenery through the glass in the back. The third floor was home to basic production and gathering occupations. Heroes worked in a sorting facility on one side of the plaza.
 </p>
 <p>
  The fourth floor was where basic combat personnel resided.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were responsible for minor combat missions and escorting gathering personnel from the third floor to weekly dungeons. As you went up the floors, responsibilities, authority, and benefits increased.
 </p>
 <p>
  But it wasn’t a pyramid structure.
 </p>
 <p>
  The majority of Niflheimr’s personnel were in the middle floors from the fifth to the eighth. This, too, was something I had arranged.
 </p>
 <p>
  From the ninth floor onward, officers and administrative personnel were located.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were in charge of commanding battles and managing Niflheimr’s facilities. Starting from the tenth floor, authority increased further.
 </p>
 <p>
  From the eleventh floor, the number of personnel drastically decreased.
 </p>
 <p>
  400 on the twelfth floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  90 on the thirteenth floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  The final thirteenth floor…
 </p>
 <p>
  Strictly speaking, it had only 5 members.
 </p>
 <p>
  The main party’s lieutenants were temporary members.
 </p>
 <p>
  The elevator door opened. Looking up, I saw a gray sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the thirteenth floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  A circular floor.

 <p>
  Unlike the city-sized other floors, it wasn’t very spacious.
 </p>
 <p>
  At best, it was the size of a small village.
 </p>
 <p>
  The top floor of Niflheimr was divided into five sections, each with its own residence.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Was that created by Yurnet?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I pointed to the central castle.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a building I hadn’t seen before.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. It was built for the Master.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They’ve made it quite grand.”
 </p>
 <p>
  While not flashy, it gleamed with black polish.
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the castle, it seemed there was an audience room that I had entered yesterday.

 <p>
  “Master, this way, please.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Mist formed on the brick path and then lined up in a row.
 </p>
 <p>
  I smirked and followed the mist. The mist led to Yurnet’s garden.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is as far as I go. Please take care.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Nisled bowed her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  She seemed to be going to attend to other duties.
 </p>
 <p>
  I entered the garden.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet was waiting next to the central table.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve prepared a meal.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet smiled and clapped her hands.

 <p>
  Various bread and salads appeared on the table.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve kept it simple, but I hope it suits your taste.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is more than enough.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I picked up a small piece of bread from the basket.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it had been a grand feast, I would have declined.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sat down and nibbled on the bread.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why did you call me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I heard you were going to train.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We admire your determination to become stronger on your own. But…”

 <p>
  Yurnet lowered her gaze.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m sorry, Master.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What for?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We understand your intentions well. But it seems like you don’t trust us.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet had a lonely expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled. I had a sense of what she wanted to say.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Becoming stronger is good. However, I hope you can rely on us a little. Is that what you mean?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. We can only watch you from the sidelines…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet hugged her arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  “She’s quite good at acting.”

 <p>
  Half of it was probably sincere.
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled and said, “I was going to ask for that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that really true?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why else would I come here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  If The Niflheimr had been of no use to me, I would have stayed in Townia. There’s a reason why I came here, beyond just wanting information. I continued speaking.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m not going to rely on you for everything. But I hope you can at least help.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How, how can we help?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet leaned forward across the table.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her face came closer.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re getting too close. Back off a bit.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “…I apologize for showing such behavior.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet adjusted her posture.
 </p>
 <p>
  “For starters, Master, should we send about a million gems to Townia?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sigh.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you seriously asking this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even with all the support, I would eventually have to stand alone from the higher floors. I can’t spoil Anytng.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Support for Townia is strictly prohibited. Contact is also prohibited. Unless I say otherwise, don’t interfere in any way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “As you command.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet bowed deeply.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘When it comes down to it…’
 </p>

 <p>
  Anytng is quite dependent on me.
 </p>
 <p>
  But this is something I have to take into account. Basic care is necessary, at the very least.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It feels like raising an elementary school student.’
 </p>
 <p>
  After clearing my thoughts about Anytng, I continued speaking.
 </p>
 <p>
  “As I mentioned, it’s about training.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Training.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Class advancement and skills.”
 </p>
 <p>
  There was one more thing to request.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had planned to bring it up when the training was nearing its completion.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you’re willing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet gave me a gentle smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have something in mind.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After finishing the meal, I left the garden.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet headed to her office, saying she would take care of Niflheimr’s affairs.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was originally a task we shared. She would be quite busy doing it alone.
 </p>
 <p>
  If I had the time, I would help, but for now, I needed to mind my own business.
 </p>
 <p>
  I walked along the path.
 </p>
 <p>
  The scenery, filled with trees and grass, began to change gradually.
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren rocky terrain.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even the path underfoot disappeared.
 </p>

 <p>
  I had completely transitioned into Yurnet’s territory.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rocks jutted up in various places.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some were as small as 1 meter, while others were over 10 meters tall. Countless blade marks were engraved on the rock surfaces.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But actually, it’s not rocks.’
 </p>
 <p>
  At first glance, they looked like rocks, but they felt different up close.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gigantic ores with a deep black shine. They were called Black Iron. It was several times harder and sharper than steel. I was familiar with this area.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Iron Mountain.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I examined the rock closely.
 </p>
 <p>
  The blade marks that had cut through the Black Iron like paper were forming a shape.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That guy carved it.’

  Sculptures on the walls inside the castle.
 </p>
 <p>
  It made sense. Besides him, there was no one to consider.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ranked 3rd in Niflheimr.
 </p>
 <p>
  Heavenly Sword, the owner of Clau Solas.
 </p>
 <p>
  (T/N: Clau Solas: Claidheamh Soluis or The Sword of Light: is a trope object that appears in a number of Irish and Scottish Gaelic folktales.)
 </p>
 <p>
  His talent was overwhelming, to the point where I once suspected him of being a bug character.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ridgion.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve been waiting.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Behind the iron mountain split in half.
 </p>
 <p>
  A cold-looking young man walked out.

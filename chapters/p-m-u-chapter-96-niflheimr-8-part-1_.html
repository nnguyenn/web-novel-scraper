  Ridgion.
 </p>
 <p>
  When he was first summoned, there was no last name in the status window.
 </p>

 <p>
  His innate rank was 2 stars. However, among the thousands of heroes I’ve drawn, I haven’t seen a genius like him. Ridgion was a hero who had actively participated in numerous missions since the early days of Niflheimr, alongside Seris.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nice to meet you for the first time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The young man bent his knee to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  His face was expressionless, but there was a burning light in his eyes. He wasn’t wearing an upper garment, and his smooth, muscular upper body was covered with scars.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stand up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridgion straightened up.
 </p>
 <p>
  A sword was stuck in the ground beside him. It was an ordinary iron sword with no particular features. It seemed like he had been practicing here alone before I arrived. Various sword marks covered the nearby dark iron.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The fact that Ridgion is here…’
 </p>
 <p>
  I can guess the intention.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the sword next to Ridgion. He used it to cut through dark iron, which is several times stronger, yet it had no scratches.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridgion spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I heard the story from Yurnet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s good, I don’t have to say it again then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why did you make such a decision?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridgion’s face wrinkled.
 </p>
 <p>
  But in the blink of an eye, Ridgion returned to his usual expressionless self.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Our hearts remain unchanged. No matter what state you are in, Master…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m sorry. My heart is the same.”
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  Ridgion turned his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  I laughed and said, “I don’t think you called me to try to convince me of the impossible.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I explained the reason.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if all five of them gathered, I had no intention of reversing the decision.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridgion must know that. He probably just feels disappointed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, that’s how it is.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridgion muttered.
 </p>
 <p>
  The flame that had been in his eyes gradually dimmed and completely disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is this how it works?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I narrowed my eyes.
 </p>

 <p>
  Ridgion’s demeanor had completely changed. It felt strange as if I were looking at an inanimate object.
 </p>
 <p>
  It must be the ultimate evolution of the Composure skill. And one more thing.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Body and Sword Unity.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I could sense the blade even though I was this far away.
 </p>
 <p>
  It felt like facing a well-forged famous sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridgion said, “Just as you made me stronger.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridgion drew the sword stuck in the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I will make you stronger too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridgion extended the sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  And he froze in that position.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Are you going to be my practice partner?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you wish.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As far as I know, the most perfect swordsman is right in front of me.
 </p>
 <p>
  While other heroes acquire abilities beyond weapon skills, he stubbornly stuck to swordsmanship. He was different from the four who carried dozens of abilities as a basic. Ridgion had only a few skills that could assist swordsmanship.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can’t help it, I have to do it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  My body burned for the first time in a while.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a feeling I didn’t feel in the fight against Jenna or Valkyrist.
 </p>
 <p>
  I drew my sword and shield.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master, come at me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridgion held the hilt of his sword lightly.
 </p>

 <p>
  I calmed my breathing and said, “Is your training method still the same?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yurnet has given you the permission, so you can see for yourself.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In that case, I won’t decline.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Status window.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridgion’s stats appeared before my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ridgion(★★★★★★) Lv. 99]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Class: Weapon Master]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Strength: 10/10]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Intelligence: 10/10]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Health: 10/10]
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  [Agility: 10/10]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Skills: Effects of ‘Heavenly Sword Spirit (Lv.Max)’ cannot be seen.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘As expected.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The total stats were 40. All stats were at 10.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the stats that a level one 1-star hero of normal summoning would have by default.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, it wasn’t his true ability. Ridgion deliberately lowered it to train his skills without relying on his body.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took a deep breath.
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t think Ridgion was underestimating me.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was just a commoner with only 10 strength, but he could cut through dark iron like it was nothing. The weapon he was holding was not the five-star divine sword, Clau Solas. It was a dull and old iron sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m coming at full power.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Anytime.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I flipped the switch in my head.
 </p>
 <p>
  A heat spread throughout my body, growing hotter.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han(★★★)’ has entered a wild state!]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Status window.’
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, I examined my own abilities.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Han Israt(★★★) Lv. 20(Exp 58/160)]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Class: Novice]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Strength: 55/45 + 10]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Intelligence: 0/10 – 10]
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-12" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 </div>
 <p>
  [Health: 51/41 + 10]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Agility: 49/39 + 10]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Skills: Low-level Swordsmanship(Lv.8), Insight(Lv.5), Fire Resistance(Lv.3), Pain Resistance(Lv.4), Composure(Lv.5), Frenzy(Lv.6), Invincible(Lv.1), Dragon’s Blood(Lv.1), Stealth(Lv.1), Horsemanship(Lv.1)]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Current State: Frenzy(Lv.6)]
 </p>
 <p>
  The current level is 20. The total stats add up to 135.
 </p>
 <p>
  When calculating the additional value of Frenzy, it becomes 155.
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to the current Ridgion, there is a difference of 115 points. When you add even intelligence, which has no effect on the physical category, the gap widens even further.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a gap between an adult and a child, no, between a giant and a newborn.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s not just strength. Stamina and agility are incomparable too. Even if the weapon skill levels are not similar, with this much difference in stats, I can easily overwhelm him; his weapon would shatter as soon as it met mine.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That’s if this guy was ordinary…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Let’s see how far I can reach with my current self.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s Go.”

 <p>
  I looked at Ridgion.
 </p>
 <p>
  His posture was unwavering, while I was leaning against a rock, catching my breath.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  ‘The difference between Ridgion and me…’
 </p>
 <p>
  I pondered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clearly, my physical abilities were superior. When I moved twice, could only Ridgion move once. When I put in the power of 10, Ridgion only had 5.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the results were completely opposite. Ridgion’s sword was faster and more powerful than mine.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just putting in more strength doesn’t make the sword stronger. The same goes for speed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridgion took a deep breath.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even if you swing with the power of 10, it doesn’t fully transfer to the sword.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That might be true.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridgion handed me a water bottle.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the water flowed down my throat, vitality surged through my body.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It doesn’t fully transfer.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a simple fact.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moving your body directly and handling a tool is different.
 </p>
 <p>
  There will always be some energy loss in those movements, whether they are small or large.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I understand the precise effects of the Heavenly Sword Spirit(Body and Sword Unity) now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When I was a master, I only knew it as a skill that adjusted swordsmanship, but now that I had experienced it firsthand, I could feel it. I emptied the water to the last drop and asked,
 </p>
 <p>
  “How much power is poured in my sword?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “About 80% of your own.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “And you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I would say about three times my own.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I clicked my tongue.
 </p>
 <p>
  But I somewhat understood. If it wasn’t at that level, Ridgion wouldn’t have been able to defeat monsters much larger and stronger than himself with just one swing.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘When he swings the sword with the power of 10, the sword contains 30 power.’
 </p>
 <p>
  However, even so, the gap in abilities between Ridgion and me is just incomparable.
 </p>
 <p>
  From the beginning, there was a difference of almost five times in pure stats alone. This was just one of the reasons. I asked,
 </p>
 <p>
  “There a lot of waste in my movements. Is that correct?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “From my perspective, yes. But it can’t be helped. It hasn’t been long since the master arrived here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The efficiency of movement was different.
 </p>

 <p>
  I also felt this fact as we clashed. When I attacked twice, he blocked once. When he swung once, I had to block twice.
 </p>
 <p>
  The moment he moved one finger, he had already pierced through everything.
 </p>
 <p>
  He knew where I was going to attack and how I was going to attack. Not only that, he perfectly exploited the tiny openings revealed in my connected movements. I had felt a similar feeling in my duels with Velkyst and Jenna, but I had never imagined trying it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ridgion.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re strong.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s an honor to receive this praise.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridgion bowed again.
 </p>
 <p>
  I scrutinized him slowly. Apart from the fact that there was almost no change in his expression, he had an ordinary appearance. His body wasn’t overly muscular. I couldn’t tell where that tremendous power he displayed in the missions came from.
 </p>
 <p>
  “He’s master.”

 <p>
  His job was a Master.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was different from the other members. He had his advancement directly at 3-star, and even as a 6-star hero, he still maintained the job he obtained earlier.
 </p>
 <p>
  The basic requirement for a Master is to be level 20 or higher 3-star Hero.
 </p>
 <p>
  And if you meet certain conditions for weapon skills, you can advance.
 </p>
 <p>
  The biggest feature is undoubtedly the significant adjustment to weapon skills.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once you acquire the unique skill, “Mantle of Expertise,” you can wield other weapons with the same efficiency as your main weapon. In other words, you can handle an unlimited number of weapons.
 </p>
 <p>
  However…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s not going to be my path.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The method of advancing to a master is confidential to the public, but of course, I knew it.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was the one who advanced Ridgion. However, it just didn’t suit my style.

 <p>
  ‘Still, there’s a lot to learn.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I stood up from the rock.
 </p>
 <p>
  The heat in my body had subsided a bit.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master, are you only staying here for a month?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s not much time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A hint of regret flickered in Ridgion’s eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you had stayed for a year, or even six months…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What would you have done for me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master, you will become even stronger than you are now.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “That’s a given.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled and spun my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then, I rushed towards Ridgion.
 </p>
 <p>
  He blocked as if he had expected my attempt to strike at his forehead.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master’s fighting style is different from mine.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang! Clang clang!
 </p>
 <p>
  Our swords clashed, sending sparks flying. I didn’t stop and continued to swing my sword. The sound of the blade cutting through the air and the friction of metal filled my ears.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Fundamentally, it’s excellent swordsmanship supported by various skills. You’re an all-rounder who can use your abilities in any situation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master, you’re similar to Seris.”
 </p>

 <p>
  I moved my sword in an attempt to attack.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thrusts that targeted the neck, chest, and legs in a three-step sequence were thrown at Ridgion.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Ridgion drew circles with his sword, all the attacks were absorbed into the trajectory.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you continue to grow properly… you’ll become the strongest.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If only it were that easy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled sarcastically.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although all the attacks were thwarted, I didn’t stop swinging my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ridgion, while I’m here, I want to raise my swordsmanship to the intermediate level.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “With Master’s talent, it’s possible.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Will you help?”
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-12" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  “I’d be happy to.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After being summoned, I had to train in almost all aspects of swordsmanship by myself.
 </p>
 <p>
  But I didn’t do it because I wanted to. I knew how important it was to have a mentor who could guide and clear the way. Learning under an excellent instructor, regardless of talent, was more efficient than self-study. That’s why I brought Aaron to Niflheimr for the same reason.
 </p>
 <p>
  Advancing swordsmanship to an intermediate level is not an easy task.
 </p>
 <p>
  Most heroes only break through to the intermediate level long after their advancement. The average level for acquiring it is 30 or higher. But I had no intention of taking it easy like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A bit faster.’
 </p>
 <p>
  To become so strong that no one could surpass me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Strong enough to handle that guy on my own.
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t want to rely on Niflheimr for everything, but I also didn’t plan to navigate this crazy world on my own.
 </p>
 <p>
  If receiving help became a condition, I would gladly accept it. And what I receive, I would eventually repay.

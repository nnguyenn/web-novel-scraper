 <p>
  Late in the afternoon.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a huge difference between low-tier and intermediate swordsmanship,” Ridgion said.
 </p>

 <p>
  “I agree.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swordsmanship formed the foundation among countless skills.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if I’m loaded with various flashy skills, if my swordsmanship lagged behind, my chances of winning would significantly diminish.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Low-tier swordsmanship is for combat, while intermediate swordsmanship is for war. From intermediate onwards, it’s not just simple brawling; it’s a battle where we create and push our domains against each other.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you talking about swordsmanship domains?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes,” Ridgion replied.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Territory, huh.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I occasionally sensed it during sparring with Velkist.
 </p>
 <p>
  If a sword came in a certain direction, I could detect it no matter how it approached. And I could counter perfectly. The Insight skill that led to Defending Projectiles was also a form of domain enhancement.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Defend your own territory and break through the opponent’s. That’s the essence of intermediate swordsmanship. Sword types like Strong Sword, Soft Sword, or Quick Sword are the means for this. You can categorize them into cavalry, archers, and spearman types.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You have already begun building your territory, Master. But it’s still an incomplete fence. You must strengthen it into a sturdy fortress.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridgion said,
 </p>
 <p>
  “If they enter your territory, no one can get out alive.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridgion presence changed again.
 </p>
 <p>
  It felt like even just a touch of his hand could seemingly cut through my entire body.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridgion adjusted his sword.
 </p>

 <p>
  At the same time, a sharp sound, like paper being sliced, was heard.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sssshhh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Cracks formed in the steel sand that surrounded us, starting from the top and running vertically.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master, when it reaches the end of your domain, you can cut it without touching or swinging,”
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, within a 50-meter radius of Ridgion, all black steel snapped apart.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nine pieces in total. The cutting edges were incredibly smooth. However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This isn’t it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to Ridgion’s true power, what was happening now was trivial.
 </p>
 <p>
  I narrowed my eyes. A faint aura of darkness shimmered beyond Ridgion’s back.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have no intention of going that far, dude.”

 <p>
  I dismissed it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t plan on choosing a master as a job,” I continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I see,” Ridgion replied with a wry smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  Skills like what just happened could only be performed by Ridgion. However, being a master had its disadvantages as well. My chosen job is going to be a warrior, as basic as it came, simple but powerful. The transition would begin after about half of my training was done.
 </p>
 <p>
  We continued sparring until late in the evening.
 </p>
 <p>
  It could be considered fighting for almost a full day. Throughout the battle, Ridgion taught me about swordsmanship. Among his teachings were some concepts that were so profound I couldn’t understand them. Nevertheless, I accepted everything without discrimination.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if I couldn’t understand it now, I might be able to later.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had one month given to me. It seemed like Ridgion was determined to cram as much as possible into that time frame. There was no room for diplomacy.
 </p>
 <p>
  “To build your domain, you need to internalize the movements of swordsmanship. Practitioners repeat the same movements tens of thousands of times for this purpose. It’s about dragging the skill into the realm of the subconscious.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The training continued.

 <p>
  Internalize swordsmanship.
 </p>
 <p>
  This meant wielding the sword as naturally as breathing.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were limits to human concentration.
 </p>
 <p>
  If a novice started swinging a sword here for the first time, they would exhaust all their available concentration on the action of swinging the sword alone. They wouldn’t be able to think about anything else.
 </p>
 <p>
  But as they continue to practice and repeat…
 </p>
 <p>
  They began to reduce the concentration required for the series of movements, including adding tension to their legs, moving their shoulders and wrists, and aiming at the target.
 </p>
 <p>
  And when that moment came, it transitioned into the subconscious level. As naturally as breathing.
 </p>
 <p>
  ***
 </p>
 <p>
  I invested all my time into training every day.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ten days passed like that.

  [Skill Awakening!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★★★)’s ‘Low-tier Swordsmanship’ has reached Lv. 10!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★★★)’s ‘Low-tier Swordsmanship’ has reached its maximum level. Evolution into higher-level skills is possible if certain conditions are met!]
 </p>
 <p>
  I had reached the limit of low-tier swordsmanship.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sheathed my sword. Ridigon was faintly smiling.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this what it feels like?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I thought as I looked at the wooden dummy in front of me.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Stab.’
 </p>
 <p>
  My body moved naturally.
 </p>
 <p>
  The tip of the sword pierced the wooden dummy’s forehead.

 <p>
  “Excellent.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s thanks to you. I appreciate it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the duration of our sparring sessions lengthened, I realized something.
 </p>
 <p>
  This guy wasn’t just engaging in simple brawling with me. He was guiding me in the direction where I could grow by adjusting the level and form of my swordsmanship.
 </p>
 <p>
  If there were weak points, he targeted them intensively to strengthen them.
 </p>
 <p>
  If there were strong points, he allowed me to feel their shortcomings.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s tailored education.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If he was an instructor, he would have achieved great results.
 </p>
 <p>
  I put my sword back in its scabbard. Above, I could see the dark evening sky. It was late in the evening.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s been ten days since I arrived here.’

 <p>
  Except for the first meeting, I had spent every day in training.
 </p>
 <p>
  The trainee education had not been attended for over a week.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yurnet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Yes.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  A response came as if it had been waiting.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Even though you are in training, it would be good if you occasionally showed yourself in the garden…&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was planning to visit tomorrow, though.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After bidding farewell to Ridgion, I headed for the elevator.
 </p>
 <p>
  Half of the first training goal had been achieved. I had to take a few days off to handle other matters.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yurnet, how far has the education progressed at the moment? Have the theoretical classes finished?”
 </p>

 <p>
  &lt;Yes. We have completed the basic theory. Starting from tomorrow, we will begin formation training.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s perfect timing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Formation training could be skipped.
 </p>
 <p>
  As I boarded the elevator, I spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “By tomorrow evening, open the dimensional gate to Myuden’s location.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;0584-dimensional realm, I see.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;May I inquire about the reason?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “I need to send someone over there.”

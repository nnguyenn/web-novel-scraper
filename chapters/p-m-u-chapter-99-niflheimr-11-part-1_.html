 <p>
  Early in the morning, I opened my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sight of the room had become familiar by now. As I got up to put on my clothes, I heard a knock at the door.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Are you awake, Master?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You can come in.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Nisled entered and immediately began tidying up the bedding.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had already tidied up once, but Nisled meticulously fixed even the smallest details.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you really have to be so thorough? It’s the same when I’m lying in it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a matter of respect for the Master.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Nisled faintly smiled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, never mind. Get rid of the illusions. I’m going out myself.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I said as I looked at the swirling mist in one corner of the room.
 </p>
 <p>
  The mist was taking on a human form.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Are you going to attend the class?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just for a mid-check. I also have a chat with the others. Just give me the morning off. I have work in the afternoon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;As you command.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The mist disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had entrusted all the classes to the clone, except for the first day, but today was different. I took the sheath and walked out of the room. I also noticed the shield in the corner. I hesitated for a moment but decided not to take the shield as I left the room.
 </p>
 <p>
  As I descended to the reception room on the 4th floor of the annex, Jenna and Aaron were waiting.
 </p>
 <p>
  They greeted me, and Jenna, who had been silently watching me, raised her head and smiled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oppa, you look different today.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “What’s different?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t know how to put it exactly. It’s just a feeling, I guess?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Her instinct was sharp as always.
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled. She might have sensed Yurnet’s magic to some extent.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the other hand, Aaron had a puzzled look as he looked at Jenna, not understanding what she was talking about.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m getting tired of the lessons. I’ve been stuck here like a bean sprout for about ten days, and I feel like my body’s getting stiff.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Starting today, it’s formation training. It’ll be a bit different.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Party formation training couldn’t be done with theory alone.
 </p>
 <p>
  It would be done in parallel with practice. I based the party formation training we had done in Townia on the training conducted at the Niflheimr training camp.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But there’s something strange. The things you told me before, were the same things they taught us during the lessons, just like you said. Like a pair of tweezers.”

 <p>
  Jenna whispered
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Isn’t your instinct too sharp!’
 </p>
 <p>
  I laughed it off.
 </p>
 <p>
  But it didn’t matter. Ever since I brought Jenna here, I knew that the fact that she would eventually figure out my true identity was inevitable. It was just a matter of sooner or later.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They’ll know that I’m not an ordinary hero.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if it weren’t Jenna, anyone with a bit of intelligence would figure it out.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had detailed information about the Pick Me Up that the heroes didn’t know, and I actively used it for growth and missions. I didn’t bother hiding it. Because if we die, it wouldn’t matter.
 </p>
 <p>
  After breakfast, we headed to the lessons.
 </p>
 <p>
  I talked to Aaron, who was walking beside me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aaron.”

 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “When today’s schedule is over, meet me in the backyard of the annex.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron blinked his eyes at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hyungnim, what’s going on?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ve learned everything we don’t know, haven’t we? From now on, it’ll be the party formation training that we’ve been doing since day one. It’s a waste of time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But we…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ll understand when you see come to see me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  That was enough. I turned my gaze. The instructor was looking at me with a cold look. I could hear him chatting. I pretended not to hear and quickened my pace.

 <p>
  The morning lessons were over.
 </p>
 <p>
  From the afternoon onwards, Yurnet’s illusions would take over again. I thought about going up to the 13th floor and doing some training with Ridgion, but I gave up. It wouldn’t be long before Aaron came. I decided to practice alone in the backyard.
 </p>
 <p>
  I dedicated myself to training for an hour or two,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master, I have opened a dimensional portal leading to Myuden’s location.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good job.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet’s voice echoed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nisled handed me a towel and some water. I wiped away the sweat with the towel and drank the water. Footsteps could be heard from the entrance of the backyard.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nisled stepped back a few steps from me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was not hiding my appearance.
 </p>
 <p>
  A while later, Aaron entered the backyard.
 </p>

 <p>
  Aaron’s gaze turned to me and then to Nisled.
 </p>
 <p>
  Question marks appeared in his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hyungnim?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yurnet, open the dimensional portal.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sss.
 </p>
 <p>
  The mist gathered and formed a door.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Follow me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I stepped through the dimensional portal.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the gentle sensation passed through my body, the scenery changed. It was Yurnet’s garden.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet, who had been sitting in the center of the garden, stood up.
 </p>

 <p>
  “It’s been a while since your last visit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet smiled faintly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “As you know, I have a guest.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. A colleague from Townia.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sss.
 </p>
 <p>
  The mist scattered in all directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned around. Aaron, with a puzzled expression, was walking out of the dimensional portal.
 </p>
 <p>
  “W-Where exactly is this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The 13th floor of Niflheimr. The Garden of Mist.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Nisled, who was behind me, replied gruffly.
 </p>

 <p>
  “If it’s the 13th floor… Is this the place where the strongest people live?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mostly, that’s correct.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron, who had been looking around with a bewildered expression, met my gaze.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hyungnim…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This person calls Master, ‘brother.'”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet stepped forward, lowering her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron and Yurnet exchanged a nod.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nice to meet you. I’m Yurnet Seed, the Master’s right hand.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right-hand… that’s Seris…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet laughed, and Nisled winced.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron, with his mouth slightly agape, stared at Yurnet and then lowered his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s going on…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t understand the situation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You wanted to become stronger, didn’t you, Aaron?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I met Aaron’s eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Regardless of the means or methods, I’m here to help you achieve what you want.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But Brother…”
 </p>
 <p>
  He must be wondering who I am.
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t answer. He would naturally find out if he stayed here.

  “What if I refuse?”

  “You summoned me here to keep the promise we made back then?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right.”

 <p>
  I replied.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What if I refuse?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No big deal. You’ll return to the training camp. You’ll receive a different education from now on.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “As our guest, you will complete instructor training at the headquarters of the training camp.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet added.
 </p>
 <p>
  I explained the situation to Yurnet briefly yesterday.
 </p>
 <p>
  “After receiving the instructor training here, you will perform that role in Townia.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Personally, I recommend that path.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet narrowed her eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron’s condition would already be quite clear to her.
 </p>
 <p>
  Level 20, Weapon Skill 4.
 </p>
 <p>
  Other skills include Fire Resistance and Pain Resistance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Stats are also lacking. Aaron’s Growth Stat was only 4.
 </p>
 <p>
  A meager talent.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Improving will be very challenging.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve seen a few people similar to our guest. They tried to cover up their lack of talent with hard work. But in the end, when they reach a certain point, they all hit a wall. They couldn’t go any further.”

 <p>
  Aaron bowed his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet’s words were cold; they penetrated to the core.
 </p>
 <p>
  Heroes without talent who aspire to combat roles typically struggle with Low Weapon Skills. No matter how much they roll around in the training camp and on missions, their levels won’t go up. 90% of these heroes give up combat roles and pursue other professions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, occasionally, there are late bloomers.
 </p>
 <p>
  They slowly make their way up to Intermediate Weapon Skill.
 </p>
 <p>
  But that’s as far as they go. By then, there are already geniuses at their level, striving alongside them. There’s no chance of them becoming the best.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just like Velkist, he has talent that’s several times greater than Aaron’s but never stops working.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Talent isn’t everything.’
 </p>
 <p>
  At least a minimum was necessary.
 </p>
 <p>
  Heroes who lacked that minimum would inevitably fall behind.
 </p>

 <p>
  “What should I do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron muttered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t despair too much. That’s usually the case.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But exceptions exist everywhere.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve seen a fool who reached our level even though he was far behind in talent. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t learn properly, no matter how much he was taught.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What did he do…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ll know if you go and see for yourself.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet drew a circle with her hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  The mist gathered, and a dimensional portal appeared.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Dimension 0584, leading to Luhanan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Beyond the dimensional portal, a different landscape appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a plain with swirling dust and a sky shining in a hazy red color.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ruhanan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It was where Myuden was staying.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was also the setting for the World Raid that took place a year ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is the Master going as well?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I think so.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s better to refrain. That place is dangerous.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet replied.

  “If the guest wishes, we can send him, but involving the Master… That place is a dimension that consumes life just by staying there. Don’t you know what fate befell those who tried to do like Myuden?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron swallowed hard.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nisled, who was beside him, spoke to Aaron.
 </p>
 <p>
  “After Myuden achieved success, many hopefuls followed. And…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They all died.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. The survival rate is less than 3%.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is it really that dangerous?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you value your life, please don’t go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Nisled asserted.

  Aaron closed his eyes and said, “But if I succeed there, I can become stronger, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you can.”
 </p>
 <p>
  You can’t help but get stronger.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s the nature of that place from the beginning. There was no other place like it no matter where you looked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I will go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron said with determination.
 </p>
 <p>
  I nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Follow me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, Hyungnim. If it’s as dangerous as that person says… I can go alone. You shouldn’t. Everyone else is waiting.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But you’re going.”
 </p>

 <p>
  Aaron shook his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t plan to die. I want to do what I can without feeling ashamed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Alright.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If he was determined like that, I decided to let him go alone.
 </p>
 <p>
  My role ends here. There is no need for further guidance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Huu.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron took a deep breath.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet, who had been silently watching, said, “Ruhanan has a different flow of time from here. Keep that in mind.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But before that, I have one question.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is it?”
 </p>

 <p>
  “It might sound rude, but Niflheimr…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet smiled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry. Aaron will be treated as an important guest in Niflheimr. There won’t be any change in your affiliation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What about you, Hyungnim?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m the same. Don’t think unnecessary thoughts.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I understand.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron closed his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  His lips moved silently. Although no sound could be heard, I could tell what he was mumbling.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nina. Aaron’s younger sister.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hyungnim, please stay safe.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron bowed to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, he stepped through the dimensional portal.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not long after, Aaron’s body became blurry.
 </p>
 <p>
  It began to be sucked into the desolate landscape inside the dimensional portal. I watched the scene with a sense of detachment.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you think he can survive?”
 </p>
 <p>
  After Myuden adapted to that world, there were a few aspirants.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were similar to Aaron. They tried to become stronger by any means necessary. I had selected such heroes and sent them to Myuden’s side.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The probability is low.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet replied.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I see.”

 <p>
  “I have conveyed a message to Myuden, but whether it will reach…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The survival rate is extremely low.
 </p>
 <p>
  I know it without being told.
 </p>
 <p>
  “When Aaron returns, send him straight to Townia.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He might not come back at all.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m saying it considering that possibility.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned away.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was still much work left to do.

  <strong>
   Chapter 1
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Kuwoong!
 </p>
 <p>
  A massive monster as big as a mountain collapsed.
 </p>
 <p>
  One by one, all the nations on Earth had fallen.
 </p>
 <p>
  The apocalyptic monster summoned in the United States, one of the last remaining ten nations, was finally subdued.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Good.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A blonde Caucasian man watching that spectacle smiled with satisfaction.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was Barren, ‘American First’ guildmaster, which was the biggest guild in the world, and he was also ranked 1st in the whole world.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud-
 </p>
 <p>
  And then.
 </p>
 <p>
  Beside the fallen monster, a dark-haired man fell down.
 </p>
 <p>
  His left arm severed, his body charred and burnt.
 </p>
 <p>
  The mighty Martial Saint, ranked 7th, Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren threw a short word.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well done.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was a pawn for him.
 </p>
 <p>
  To Barren, Seong Jihan from ‘Korea’ was a useful hunting dog.
 </p>
 <p>
  And today, the hunting dog had fulfilled its mission excellently.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though he was greatly injured.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Regeneration!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ranked 3rd, the priestess dashed forward in a hurry, spreading healing magic.
 </p>
 <p>
  But as time passed, her expression stiffened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Normally, with her power, she could instantly heal burns and the like, but the burns sustained while facing the apocalyptic monster were unusually severe.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jihan! Just a bit, hold on. Please… Great Heal! Great…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Tears streamed down the priestess’s face as she spread healing magic.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing her pour all her energy and life into it, Barren frowned for a moment, then turned his gaze to the monster’s corpse.
 </p>
 <p>
  The apocalyptic monster, Behemoth.
 </p>
 <p>
  From its body, a sinister aura oozed out, enough to send shivers down one’s spine.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s difficult to endure even from here, I wonder how he endured it up close.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Once again amazed at Seong Jihan’s strength from a distance, Barren’s eyes lit up for a moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh-
 </p>
 <p>
  From the fallen Behemoth’s remains, a bright white light surged.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s… the boss battle reward!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Rare Treasure Chest from the Boss Monster.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whenever it appeared, the bright white light would burst forth from the center of the monster.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Everyone, step back!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Barren raised his hand, dozens of American First guild members stepped back, guarding the surroundings.
 </p>
 <p>
  A special reward from Behemoth, the monster known as the apocalypse.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though they might have been tempted by it, they couldn’t defy the stern command of Barren, ranked 1st in the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  And as Barren surveyed his guild members, he chose those who would receive the reward: the priestess, along with the 4th and 5th ranked members of American First.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What about Jihan?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He’s not an American. He’s just a hunting dog.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who played the biggest role in bringing down Behemoth, was naturally excluded from the conversation as if it were a matter of course.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But he’s also an American now! He sought asylum here!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You know very well what I mean by ‘American’.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But the apocalypse monster is…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Argh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Listening silently to the conversation, Seong Jihan smirked.
 </p>
 <p>
  Such rewards weren’t expected from Barren.
 </p>
 <p>
  Slowly, Seong Jihan spoke up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just go. It’s alright.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Sorry. I’ll be there soon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the priestess got up, Barren seemed relieved.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Korean hunting dog.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet he knows the subject.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Go, Barren.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course. Fly!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Through Barren’s flight magic, the three flew over Behemoth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan watched their departure with cloudy eyes. He lost his country and became an exile.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the three players of the superpower, the United States. Though the difference in rank wasn’t great, their positions in the guild were worlds apart.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What reward will come from Behemoth?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking at the corpse of the monster he had brought down with his own hands, Seong Jihan pondered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if it was a monster from a demotion match, it was still the final boss, so it was sure to be something good.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…It’s fine. It wasn’t mine to begin with. I should focus on regenerating my lost left arm.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In that moment of calmly facing reality and adjusting himself, the ground suddenly shook, and a message window appeared before everyone’s eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Space League – Bronze League Demotion Match Results Announcement.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A sense of foreboding hung in the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Game Category – Defense.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [USA – Success.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [China – Success.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Russia – Failure.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Japan – Failure.]
 </p>
 <p>
  …
 </p>
 <p>
  While the USA and China succeeded, From Russia and below, all had failed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s face stiffened when he heard that out of the final 10 countries, only two succeeded.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is…’
 </p>
 <p>
  [NO. 4212 ‘Humanity’ has failed the demotion match.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [With NO. 4773 ‘Orc’, will participate in the final demotion match.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The battle will take place immediately.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Zing-
 </p>
 <p>
  The message window expanded, displaying a single screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Within it, a grand stage was unveiled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Gu-Guildmaster…”
 </p>
 <p>
  And there.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the screen stood Barren and his team who had gone to claim Behemoth’s reward, their expressions stern.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘And a player from China is there. A total of five.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Five players ranked higher than Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  With them, no more players were summoned.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  On the other side of the stage, Five members of the Orc race, with green skin and features resembling pigs, stood.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The battle begins.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A 5 vs 5 battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  The losing side here would face demotion.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please…”
 </p>
 <p>
  A guild member clasped their hands together to pray.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of all opponents, it had to be the Orcs!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jihan should’ve been summoned too!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Some lamented while glancing towards Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite selecting five members, Jihan, ranked 7th, couldn’t be summoned due to his lower rank.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the guild members knew.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was truly the powerhouse of American First… no, the world’s strongest player.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if he had lost an arm, they would have felt more reassured if he had been summoned.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Hahaha! What a joke. ‘That monster’ isn’t here!
 </p>
 <p>
  Orc, who was at the forefront, looked around at the Earthlings and burst into mocking laughter.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was well acquainted with that Orc.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That’s the one who ran away in the previous battle.’

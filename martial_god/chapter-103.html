  <strong>
   Chapter 103
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  “…You call yourself an expert, Miss?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course! The money I’ve lost on betting… Ahem! And the time I’ve invested in it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Just because you’ve lost a lot of money and time doesn’t make you an expert.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lim Gayeong advised Lee Hayeon with a sigh.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why not just bet for Seong Jihan? You’ve earned a lot doing that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, I made a lot from the Japanese victories and the Korean losses. But… I’ve won too much. It’s about time for the Boss to lose, statistically speaking.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The initial amount Lee Hayeon had lost was considerably recovered thanks to following Seong Jihan’s bets. However, as she recovered, she became more and more anxious.
 </p>
 <p>
  “People can’t keep winning like this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  How could there be an endless streak of victories in this cruel world of gambling? Even if you’ve boasted a 100% win rate so far, this world can turn against you at any time.
 </p>
 <p>
  And Lee Hayeon believed that this was the time when Seong Jihan wouldn’t come in first.
 </p>
 <p>
  Buzz!
 </p>
 <p>
  [Please bet on me again for this Top 100.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A message from Seong Jihan rang on Lee Hayeon’s smartphone.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Boss. It’s too late…”
 </p>
 <p>
  If he was confident, he would’ve messaged earlier.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Such a delayed message actually gives me more assurance.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Having already made up her mind, Lee Hayeon sipped the remaining wine and approached the computer.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh! Sister~ You’re here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah opened the door to the guild master’s room.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, Yoon Seah. What brings you here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, Sister. Hehe. I just felt there were still people in the guild, so I came. But, have you been drinking?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. I had a difficult choice to make…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon, the expert when it came to making bets, said with teary eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What kind of choice?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well… it’s a bit awkward saying it in front of you…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come on! Tell me, Sister!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Yoon Seah cheerfully approached, Lee Hayeon reluctantly showed her the monitor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her betting history, where she chose China’s rising star, Heavenly Demon Wang Lin, as the first-place winner, was displayed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a secret from the Boss, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course~ But why did you choose Wang Lin instead of Barren?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, Barren is strong, but he seems a bit unreliable.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps it was because of his disgraceful performance during the previous Count Naseed raid.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Mages like Barren had the advantage in defense maps, Lee Hayeon believed that Wang Lin from China was the top candidate to win.
 </p>
 <p>
  The odds for both were almost similar, so it wouldn’t be strange if either of them ranked first.
 </p>
 <p>
  But just the similarity itself was a humiliation for the usual Barren.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I see~”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Remember, it’s a secret from the Boss, okay?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course, Sister. My lips are sealed!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, indicating her sealed lips, looked at Lim Gayeong.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sister Gayeong.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Honey?
 </p>
 <p>
  Without making a sound, Yoon Seah exaggeratedly puckered her lips.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nod!
 </p>
 <p>
  Lim Gayeong simply nodded in response.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Honey.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What honey? What are you two signaling about?”
 </p>
 <p>
  For some reason, it felt annoying.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Lee Hayeon inquired, Yoon Seah casually responded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh. She said there’s a tip that helps when doing weights.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, there’s something like that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, Miss.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon tilted her head in confusion.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although she felt uneasy, if the two of them said so, it must be true.

 <p>
  “Okay. Make sure you learn well by watching what Gayeong does.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sure. Sister. Hehe.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Feeling guilty that Lee Hayeon was worried about her, Yoon Seah couldn’t help but feel a bit sorry.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, she thought,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Please take care of it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Although she felt apologetic, the stakes were too high to miss out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah went all in with full confidence on Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Miss, thank you always.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lim Gayeong also bet all of her GP.
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  September 25th, 6 a.m.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle! Time for breakfast.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, roused by Yoon Seah’s call, was taken aback by the lavish spread on the table.
 </p>
 <p>
  When did she even start preparing this?
 </p>
 <p>
  The table was laden with side dishes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Furthermore, the menu consisted mainly of Jihan’s favorite dishes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come on, I prepared everything you like! Just don’t overeat!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why are you doing this all of a sudden?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s the Top 100 match today. I have to cheer you on!”
 </p>
 <p>
  She didn’t act like this during the Bronze Top 100 match.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jihan could guess why Yoon Seah was acting like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How much did you bet?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Hehe.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah then showed her palm.
 </p>
 <p>
  “50 billion?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sigh… Hard to believe this is the spending of a teenager.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come on, uncle! I heard there aren’t many jackpot games like this. Because of the BattleNet betting system announcement, a lot of people are flocking, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Top 100 promotion matches were all held on the same day.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bronze or silver matches didn’t attract much attention.
 </p>
 <p>
  Usually, interest and money poured into the higher-level matches.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, due to a notification on the BattleNet betting site, the silver promotion match in particular was receiving the most bets of all the Top 100 promotion matches.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seeing how you splurged, Hayeon must’ve bet on someone else?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, sister made a different judgment with her expert view. Oh, please don’t act like you knew. She told me not to tell anyone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Haha, I’ll tease her after it ends.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Confident about the outcome, Jihan started eating.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Speaking of which, don’t you also have a promotion match?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, thanks to you, uncle, I get to play in one in just a month.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Until the beginning of September, Yoon Seah only trained in the game to increase her stamina.
 </p>
 <p>
  But after teaming up with Jihan, she progressed rapidly and managed to reach level 25, which allowed for promotion.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You are the one who needs to prepare more than me. Are you ready?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s just a Gangnam Area 3 promotion match. You are more important, uncle.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks to Jihan, Yoon Seah was able to level up quickly, but she wasn’t lacking in real battle experience.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the gift of ‘Late Bloomer’, she could play the game twice a day, giving her as much combat experience as an average bronze player. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m
 </p>
 <p>
  Equipped with rare stat perseverance and excellent gear, it was a sure thing that she wouldn’t fail in her promotion match.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Speaking of which, ‘Late Bloomer’… wasn’t it said that it gets upgraded after playing 50 games on BattleNet?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Gift – Late Bloomer (Rank-F – Participate 50 times in the game to upgrade)]
 </p>
 <p>
  The upgrade conditions for Late Bloomer, found through Hermes’s Monocle.
 </p>
 <p>
  For Yoon Seah, who had played twice daily from day one, the 25th day would be her 50th game.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, but today is a promotion match, so I can’t play twice. It’s a shame.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, it’ll upgrade when you reach silver.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right. Anyway…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, not worried about her promotion match at all, folded her hands in request to Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle, really, don’t worry about me! Eat well and please, please secure 1st place! Got it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sigh… Thank you. Thanks.”
 </p>
 <p>
  50 billion, she bet on this?
 </p>
 <p>
  Jihan chuckled and picked up a piece of beef with his chopsticks.
 </p>
 <p>
  His hand movements, while picking side dishes, became faster, eventually blurring out of Yoon Seah’s sight.
 </p>
 <p>
  The food on the dining table disappeared in an instant, and Yoon Seah became worried for no reason.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… Uncle, don’t eat so quickly! What will you do if you get sick?”
 </p>

 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you mean get sick? You prepared a feast worth 50 billion won, of course, I have to eat it all.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With swift eating sounds.
 </p>
 <p>
  In less than 10 minutes, after finishing all the food and wiping his mouth, Seong Jihan said,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, I’ll be summoned soon. I’ll secure the 1st place and come back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Waving his hand to Yoon Seah, he disappeared into the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, seriously…! He should’ve left some for me!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah looked at the dining table with a dumbfounded expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  The plates, which were full of food, were now completely empty.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sigh… I should just have a protein shake.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She was too exhausted to cook again after preparing all those side dishes.
 </p>
 <p>
  She quickly made a protein shake and began preparing for her promotion match.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘First, I need to watch Uncle’s match.’
 </p>
 <p>

 <p>
  September 25th, 7 am.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Top 100 Silver Promotion Match begins.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Aligned with the World League 1st place, New York League’s timing, the Top 100 Promotion Match began.
 </p>
 <p>
  This monthly event, unlike usual times,
 </p>
 <p>
  – The September Top 100 Promotion Match…! It will start soon! This time, it will start one day earlier, exclusively for Silver!
 </p>
 <p>
  For Silver, the schedule was advanced by a day.
 </p>
 <p>
  On Channel 0, worldwide,
 </p>
 <p>
  American BattleNet commentators and casters who were given the privilege of broadcasting due to being the World League 1st place, were chatting.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Christopher! I heard you rushed here from Hawaii.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Yes! I lost a day of my vacation! If it wasn’t for Mr. Seong, I would still be in Hawaii! Even adjusting the schedule… Incredible, really!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Oh, who exactly is Mr. Seong that he managed to change the schedule?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ha! Are you pretending not to know? Among the viewers watching right now, is there anyone who doesn’t know Mr. Seong?
 </p>
 <p>
  – There might be! For those who suddenly turned on Channel 0 and were surprised to see the promotion match starting, can you explain?
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though Seong Jihan’s fame had spread worldwide over the past month,
 </p>
 <p>
  The caster still asked Christopher to explain for those who might not know him.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Mr. Seong, his full name is Seong Jihan, a great player from Korea!
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, Christopher’s praise began.
 </p>
 <p>
  He never missed a 1st place in any game.
 </p>
 <p>
  He defeated the Marquis Nashid, won against Diamond players while being in Silver.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having the unique stats ‘Force’ and ‘Martial Power’, he never wore any special armor except for weapons.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because…
 </p>
 <p>
  – He hasn’t been hit even once!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Oh, Christopher, compared to the last time you commented, you seem to have become a fan!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Hahaha! After watching his gameplay, you can’t help but become a fan! He is truly the most promising player in the world!
 </p>
 <p>
  – I agree. A month ago, if I heard such words, I would’ve said America has its Barren… but now, I must admit. Seong Jihan is currently the most powerful Silver player!
 </p>
 <p>
  On Channel 0, watched by people all over the world,
 </p>
 <p>
  The caster and commentator repeatedly praised Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  The atmosphere was significantly different from a month ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  The overwhelming achievements that Seong Jihan accomplished in that time were the reason.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Is it because he’s so powerful that even the system, the very BattleNet system, intervened?
 </p>
 <p>
  – They changed the schedule, changed the map. They adjusted the balance to be unfavorable to Seong!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Haha, thanks to that, I lost a day of my vacation!
 </p>
 <p>
  The commentators then began analyzing the map to be used for this promotion match.
 </p>
 <p>
  – This map is a special defense map… ‘The Tomb of the Raided Conqueror.’
 </p>
 <p>
  – The Tomb of the Raided Conqueror! Isn’t this used as a dungeon map? Players usually raid it, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Yes, most got gold bars converted to GP there.
 </p>
 <p>
  – So this time, players are defending against tomb raiders?
 </p>
 <p>
  In response to the caster’s question, the commentator displayed data he received from the BattleNet system.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Yes… that’s right! However, the scale of the tomb raiders is the problem!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Who are these tomb raiders that you speak of so gravely?
 </p>
 <p>
  – A massive Undead Alliance from space. They’re called ‘Kill the King!’
 </p>
 <p>
  – Kill the King? Why such a name for an Undead Alliance?
 </p>
 <p>
  – I don’t know! I’m not familiar with cosmic affairs!
 </p>
 <p>
  Kill the King.
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers were puzzled by this unfamiliar name and the odd naming of the Undead Alliance.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘… Why are they already here?’
 </p>
 <p>
  In-game, Seong Jihan frowned as he looked at the mission description that appeared before him.

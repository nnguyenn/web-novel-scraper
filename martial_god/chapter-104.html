  Chapter 104

 <p>
  <strong>
   Chapter 104
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Top 100 Silver Promotion Match begins.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You are assigned to a special balanced map, ‘Tomb of the Raided Conqueror’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Undead Alliance pursuing equality for all, ‘Kill the King’, targets the soul of the conqueror. Defend against the onslaught of ‘Kill the King’ until the Conqueror awakens!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The otherworldly Undead Legion, Kill the King.
 </p>
 <p>
  They held more than half the responsibility for Earth’s doom.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If the World Tree Alliance was responsible for Earth’s continuous losses in the Space League… Kill the King was in charge of the clean-up.’
 </p>
 <p>
  On planets that rank low in the Space League, more dungeons appear.
 </p>
 <p>
  The World Tree Alliance had decisively crushed Earth in the league matches.
 </p>
 <p>
  And from the dungeons that subsequently opened, Undead Legions with banners bearing a golden crown pierced by three spears poured out.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It started off easy.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The initial wave of undead consisted of just zombies and skeletons.
 </p>
 <p>
  With modern firepower, this was a manageable force.
 </p>
 <p>
  But, after a few repulsions, the Undead Legion that appeared were entirely different.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The intangible enemy, ghosts, couldn’t be combated with just an army.’
 </p>
 <p>
  North Korea’s fall was mainly due to these intangible monsters.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, North Korea’s downfall was partly because they nationally suppressed the growth of players and were caught off guard.
 </p>
 <p>
  Other countries tried to counter the intangible monsters by boosting the power of Mage and Support players.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the beginning, this approach had some success, but
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They were outnumbered.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Once a dungeon portal opened, undead poured out without pause.
 </p>
 <p>
  Initially, the dungeon portals released not just undead but various monsters of different types.
 </p>
 <p>
  But at some point, only ghost legions holding the flag of ‘Kill the King’ aggressively emerged.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Eventually, every region had the flag of ‘Kill the King’ planted…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Once dungeons began to emerge, it was the end for that country.
 </p>
 <p>
  Such a perception existed even during this tutorial phase, and it was solidified mainly due to the ghost legions of Kill the King.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Facing ‘Kill the King’ won’t make this game easy.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked around after being summoned.
 </p>
 <p>
  The direction he had to defend was the northern area.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not inside the tomb, but outside.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sturdy walls encircled the tomb in all four cardinal directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan stood on the northern wall, where guards made of clay, like those he had seen in old dungeon maps, were positioned at various points.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Player ‘Seong Jihan’ and 9 lower-ranked players will defend the north, while the remaining 90 players will defend the south.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The side whose gate breaks first will be defeated and ranked at the very bottom.]
 </p>
 <p>
  One by one, party members were summoned to the northern gate.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just like the system message indicated, only nine more were summoned, and no additional personnel were placed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The intention to suppress the game-breaker Seong Jihan was evident.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have completed the achievement ‘Becoming a Balance Adjuster(1)’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have earned 30,000 achievement points.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “There was an achievement for this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  After checking the achievement message, Seong Jihan looked at his teammates.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… To be on the same team as Seong Jihan…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sigh… We’ve lost…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Players from around the world who were summoned looked at Seong Jihan, clearly showing their disappointment.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether you win or lose in the Top 100 match, you still get promoted just by playing.
 </p>
 <p>
  But everyone wanted to be on the winning side, not the losing one.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Am I really ranked below 90? That’s impossible…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Being summoned here was essentially a system confirmation that they were below the top 90 of the Top 100.
 </p>
 <p>
  No one was in high spirits.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the last person to be summoned exclaimed,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh! Jihan! Hey! We’re on the same side!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Supporter Sophia, seeing Seong Jihan, jumped around with excitement.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sophia? How come you’re here…?”
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan blinked in surprise.
 </p>
 <p>
  She shouldn’t be ranked here, should she?
 </p>
 <p>
  To his question, Sophia smiled brightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, I didn’t use my stat points.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is it because of the Otherworldly Relic?’
 </p>
 <p>
  An Otherworldly Relic raises divine power if you hold onto it and pray.
 </p>
 <p>
  The one who told him about this was none other than the future Sophia.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan roughly guessed why she didn’t allocate her stats.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t you wonder why?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As she approached with sparkling eyes, she prompted him to ask the question he wanted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I am curious.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Heh. Right? You’re curious, aren’t you? Then treat me to a meal, and I’ll tell you!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t have time to go to America.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll go to Korea! It’s perfect timing since there’s a break after the promotion match!”
 </p>
 <p>
  …She’s coming to Korea just for a meal?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was flabbergasted.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘When did she start having a thing for me?’
 </p>
 <p>
  In his previous life, when he was part of America First, Sophia had shown interest in Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Back then, Seong Jihan, preoccupied with other matters, had ignored her.
 </p>
 <p>
  But Sophia at that time was quite serious.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I had a rough idea why back then…’
 </p>
 <p>
  In the game, and even in reality, he had rescued her multiple times, shielding her from enemies and becoming a reliable protector.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if it wasn’t intentional, Seong Jihan had collaborated with Sophia in key moments as teammates.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps that’s why, aside from Sophia, many Supporter and Mages from America First had a favorable impression of him.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it wasn’t for Seong Jihan, dozens would have died in real battles.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But why is she behaving this way now?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking at Sophia waiting for his response, Seong Jihan frowned, unable to understand.
 </p>
 <p>
  The mystery remained unsolved until he found out that she had a severe warrior mania.
 </p>
 <p>
  And all these scenes of Sophia approaching Seong Jihan were being broadcasted live worldwide.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  – …What… the… hell…
 </p>
 <p>
  When Sophia, being part of Seong Jihan’s team, had their conversation aired, commentator Christopher was at a loss for words.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Christopher! It seems Sophia is quite interested in Seong Jihan! Is she like this at home too?
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s right.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia was the younger sister of commentator Christopher.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ah… I knew Sophia admired warriors but…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Hahaha. This is the first time I’ve seen you so flustered, Christopher!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Imagine your pious sister who prays every day suddenly meeting a guy and announcing she’s going to a foreign country! How should I react?!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Just support your sister’s youth!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Oh, shi… You should have whispered that! Why in the middle of a live broadcast…
 </p>
 <p>
  – She must be really into him!
 </p>
 <p>
  – You’re lucky not to have a sister like that!
 </p>
 <p>
  – If I had a sister like Sophia, it would be an honor!
 </p>
 <p>
  Christopher glared at the unyielding caster and took a deep breath.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yeah, it’s her choice if she likes Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  But blowing it up on the Top 100 broadcast?
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewer count is already over a billion!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Haha. I’d love to see more of Christopher being flustered, but we have to move the camera to the southern side now. Oh, the atmosphere seems more tense than I thought?
 </p>
 <p>
  Fortunately for Christopher, the broadcast’s focus shifted from the northern side, where Seong Jihan was, to the southern side.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were 90 players over there after all…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Yes… There’s a tense atmosphere between Barren and China’s Wang Lin!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ooh. Yes, they’re shouting!Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  The two representative players of the US and China drew attention with their confrontation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Barren.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  The one who initiated the conflict was China’s Wang Lin.
 </p>

 <p>
  “How do you feel?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What are you talking about?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m curious how it feels to have the highest odds stolen from you by me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The bearded oriental man in his early 40s approached Barren and taunted him.
 </p>
 <p>
  China’s Wang Lin, known as the ‘Heavenly Demon’.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aside from Seong Jihan, he was unmatched in skill among the Silver Rank warriors.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you come here to pick a fight?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No. Just wanted to show the difference between us.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Payout Ratio Lowest at 1st place.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was a measure that ultimately showed whom the masses believed would be the winner of this Top 100 match.
 </p>
 <p>
  And in the end, the one assigned the lowest payout ratio was not Barren of the U.S., but Wang Lin of China.
 </p>
 <p>
  He stroked his beard, laughing at Barren.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I shouldn’t have given in then. If I knew you, with the absurd gift of ‘having 2 status windows,’ would be this pathetic, I would’ve said something.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Get lost, you bastard.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thanks to your refusal to take All-Stat 1 and choosing to end yourself, Mikhail and I had our regrets lessened. Although Master Seong Jihan did party with us for a few days, an opportunity like that never came again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you making a fuss because you missed out on All-Stat 1?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, that too. But you see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Wang Lin pointed to his mouth from which English was naturally coming out.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t like the fact that, from my mouth, instead of Chinese, English is coming out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why are you arguing with me about it? It’s your league that’s falling behind, isn’t it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Broadcasts that are sent out worldwide, like the Top 100 promotion match, are broadcasted from the country that achieved the No.1 spot in the World League Power Rankings.
 </p>
 <p>
  And this broadcast right also included language domain, which means at international tournaments, English, the language of the U.S., was automatically used.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was an absolute rule that applied to everyone, whether Korean like Seong Jihan or Chinese like Wang Lin.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehe. That’s why I’m saying this. The New York League will soon give the No.1 spot to the Beijing League.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hah. Show your performance first. Aren’t you speaking English from your mouth right now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Humph! It won’t be long. Soon from your mouth… right, Cantonese will come out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Cantonese? Where is that? Could you please explain it so I can understand?”
 </p>
 <p>
  USA and China.
 </p>
 <p>
  The players from the two superpowers were fiercely competing, and it was being broadcasted live without any cuts.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Christopher! Are we getting fired?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Hahaha. While the Beijing League is the 2nd top league in the world, it’s still far behind the New York League in power ranking. We won’t face layoffs!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Still, I wish Barren would put in more effort! Heavenly Demon Wang Lin is indeed a powerful player among Silvers… But Barren isn’t someone to be underestimated like this!
 </p>
 <p>
  Heavenly Demon Wang Lin.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was undeniably a strong player.
 </p>
 <p>
  With an SSS-grade Gift, the Heavenly Demon Body, he was a Chinese silver Warrior who single-handedly dominated the Bronze Top 100 promotion match two months ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  The American commentators were all convinced that ‘having 2 status windows’ was stronger than ‘Heavenly Demon Body.’
 </p>
 <p>
  – Exactly! Having 2 status windows! It’s a gift of a generation! Barren has the potential to become a superstar. He just got lost for a while, that’s all! He’ll come back and surprise us!
 </p>
 <p>
  – I hope that’s in this match.
 </p>
 <p>
  – With the most powerful competitor, Seong Jihan, getting a balance patch to the north, now it’s Barren’s turn!
 </p>
 <p>
  With the North in despair due to a lack of players,
 </p>
 <p>
  From the perspective of the South, where the U.S. and China are competing,
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom! Boom! Boom-!
 </p>
 <p>
  The battlefield echoed with the sound of drums.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Take down the king.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A voice could be heard.
 </p>
 <p>
  Adjusted for channel 0’s broadcast, the sinister voice had switched to English.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Break the ranks!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [All are equal!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Kill the King.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the otherworldly Undead Legion advanced,
 </p>
 <p>
  Skeletons, zombies, and all alike,
 </p>
 <p>
  All opened their mouths and chanted in that eerie voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Bring down the conqueror!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Give a fair death to all!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Kill the King!]
 </p>
 <p>
  That chilling voice didn’t sound like the undead, but more like revolutionaries.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Notes:
 </p>
 <p>
  TL/N: Undead Alliance and Undead Legion are both different things; Alliance refers to one of the Space League Alliances such as World Tree Alliance, while Legion is a small force which invades Earth, such as ‘Kill the King’.]

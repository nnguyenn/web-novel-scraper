  Chapter 106
 </h3>
 <p>
  [Translator – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  Chapter 106
 </p>
 <p>
  The northern wall was shattered in an instant by a gigantic hand made of black iron.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan had seen it before.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s the iron hand I saw in the 10 towers. Was it called the Black Hand?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Apostle of Destruction, ‘Black Hand’.
 </p>
 <p>
  He hadn’t encountered this monster in his previous life.
 </p>
 <p>
  The beings called apostles varied greatly in power.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some were as moderate as the Count Naseed of the Valley of the End map, and others as mighty as the Apostle of the Apocalypse capable of destroying nations.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It probably isn’t as strong as the Apostle of the Apocalypse.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, wielding his Phoenix’s Arrow, charged straight towards the broken wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  And there,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel was already confronting the gigantic Black Hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Heh-heh-heh-heh! Why is a Shadow Elf here?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Quiet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In the center of the Black Hand’s palm,
 </p>
 <p>
  There was a set of lips, the size of a human head, shining bright crimson.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed moisturized and glossy as if lipstick had been applied.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh! I should be louder!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The voice that came from there was as grating as nails on a chalkboard, and so insufferably arrogant that it instantly induced a strong aversion.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Heh-heh-heh! Heh-heh-heh!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The gigantic palm came down to squash Ariel like a bug.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel couldn’t dodge the fast-approaching hand and was pinned down.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the Black Hand, having captured her, let out a disappointed noise.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Argh… a true Shadow Elf! Annoying!]
 </p>
 <p>
  No wonder,
 </p>
 <p>
  When the Black Hand raised its hand again, the shadow that had spread on the ground rose and took Ariel’s form once more.
 </p>
 <p>
  For Ariel, who could transform her body into a shadow, the Black Hand’s physical attacks were ineffective.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  The same was true for Ariel’s attacks on the Black Hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  The shadow of the Black Hand rose and transformed into a sword, piercing through it, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  “So hard…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Black Hand was incredibly hard, Ariel’s shadow sword couldn’t even scratch it, as they both shared the same dark nature.
 </p>
 <p>
  Neither could harm the other.
 </p>
 <p>
  To break this deadlock, outside intervention was necessary.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “He’s here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzzzap!
 </p>
 <p>
  Lightning rained down on the back of the Black Hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  The thunder spread rapidly across the entire iron hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the Thunderbolt Strike unleashed from Seong Jihan’s Phoenix’s Arrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Eeek! Eeeeeek…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Black Hand, which showed no reaction to Ariel’s shadow sword, now groaned in pain.
 </p>
 <p>
  The peculiar sound coming from its red lips was so unique that the commentators mentioned it.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Uh. Christopher! That sound is truly one of a kind!
 </p>
 <p>
  – It’s like nails on a chalkboard! It’s giving me goosebumps!
 </p>
 <p>
  – I can’t imagine the hardship of the players who have to hear it directly.
 </p>
 <p>
  – That hand… While its body is made of iron, its mouth seems quite vulnerable! I wish it would keep quiet!
 </p>
 <p>
  [This power… Hah. Hah.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Black Hand, whose lips were trembling, briefly turned transparent and then returned to its iron form.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, the lips on its palm shifted to the back of the hand, facing Seong Jihan who had struck from behind.
 </p>
 <p>
  [That is… heh-heh-heh… someone surpassing a king!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Black Hand let out an exclamation, sensing the energy from the Thunderbolt Strike of the Phoenix’s Arrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed to recognize the power of the thunderbolt.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Catch him before he grows stronger!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Black Hand turned transparent again.
 </p>
 <p>
  From Seong Jihan’s keen senses, the iron hand had completely vanished.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…How did it do that?’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Could it be a kind of transparent magic?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking so, Seong Jihan scattered thunder into the air, but nothing caught on.
 </p>
 <p>
  And a moment later.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  [Grrrr… Come with me!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The hand that had been invisible suddenly sprung out, trying to grip Seong Jihan’s body tightly.
 </p>

 <p>
  The Black Hand that disappeared in an instant, leaping freely through space.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed nothing could obstruct it.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Grr, Grrr…! What is this power!?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Before fully gripping Seong Jihan, the hand’s movement halted.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Black Hand seemed blocked by something in the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  The black fingers curled, unable to get any closer to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Thankfully, it can’t penetrate the Force’s Absolute Domain.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Absolute Domain of the Force.
 </p>
 <p>
  This expanded realm, growing with the power level, didn’t easily get pushed by the Black Hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Still, I was almost caught.’
 </p>
 <p>
  How did it completely erase its presence?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided he must restrain it with all his might now that it has shown itself.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nameless Divine Arts, Divine Thunder Decree – Lightning Body
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzt!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s body began to turn transparent, with lightning rising all over.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Lightning Body, aligning with the energy of lightning.
 </p>
 <p>
  To utilize the other martial arts of the Divine Thunder Decree more powerfully, one must be in the state of Lightning Body.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Grr… Huh? What. What. What! Already doing that?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing Seong Jihan in his Lightning Body, the Black Hand panicked.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Grrrr! Must~ catch you! Awaken, Kings!]
 </p>
 <p>
  On the third finger of the iron Black Hand, a pure white cloud began to form.
 </p>
 <p>
  No, upon closer inspection, it wasn’t a cloud but a collection of spirits.
 </p>
 <p>
  The swirling spirits inside had twisted faces.
 </p>
 <p>
  All of them wore crowns.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’ll join them here. Grrrr!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The third finger dispersed.
 </p>
 <p>
  When gathered, the spirits didn’t seem like much.
 </p>
 <p>
  But when spread out, each of them showed their extraordinary presence.
 </p>
 <p>
  After all, if they were ‘Kings’ acknowledged by Kill the King,
 </p>
 <p>
  They would all be significant figures.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They’re still losers. No need to pay them any mind.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Without blinking an eye, Seong Jihan focused solely on the Black Hand’s mouth, releasing lightning.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nameless Divine Arts, Divine Thunder Decree – Striking Thunderbolt
 </p>
 <p>
  [Grr… Grrraack…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Lightning Body’s Striking Thunderbolt.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was different in magnitude.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Black Hand’s massive mouth was entirely blocked by the white lightning.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzz!
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ow. Ow. Ow! Why keep shooting…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, the Striking Thunderbolt was continuous.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lightning continuously emitted through the end of the Phoenix’s Arrow combined with the fundamental flames, scorching and burning the Black Hand’s mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Grrraack… Block it! Kings!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The spirits trying to ambush Seong Jihan quickly latched onto the lightning following the Black Hand’s command.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  When the undead met the superior lightning, the extraordinary spirits couldn’t hold on for long and disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Grr. Grrr… Fine. Wait!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps finding a brief moment of opportunity due to that,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Black Hand turned transparent again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s Striking Thunderbolt aimed for the mouth again, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  Zap!
 </p>
 <p>
  The lightning just missed, brushing past the void.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Tsk!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan clicked his tongue.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘How on earth does he disappear?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Throughout his past life’s experiences, he had faced countless enemies.
 </p>
 <p>
  But none had ever erased their presence so perfectly, only to reappear.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s as if he went to another world and came back.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…That guy too, right? He was an Apostle, wasn’t he?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to Count Naseed, who was easily captured by Seong Jihan, Black Hand was quite the headache.
 </p>
 <p>
  For a moment, he thought about the commonality between the two, then his mind wandered to the item he obtained from Count Naseed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Veil of the Void. It seems to have a similar effect as what that guy uses…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, its effect wears off when you move, and although Black Hand’s stealth was more effective compared to the Veil of the Void which allows the user to evade SSS-grade attacks,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s try using it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Since in this current situation, he had nothing to lose.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan took out the Veil of the Void from his inventory and used it.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now… This time…”
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  From the world inside the veil, Seong Jihan was able to spot a figure wearing a black robe.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Black hand, who made peculiar noises and was unpredictably cunning.
 </p>
 <p>
  His laugh was eerily strange and it was clear he wasn’t an ordinary opponent.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘At first glance, he seems more normal than expected. A human species perhaps?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Though much of his features were concealed by the robe and one couldn’t get a clear view, the size was similar to a human.
 </p>
 <p>
  Only the edges of his face were visible, extremely pale, with no distinct facial features in sight.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, let’s go back then…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Muttering to himself, he played with an iron glove on his white hand and tilted his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where did this guy go?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Due to Seong Jihan’s use of the Veil of the Void, he couldn’t find him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Confused, he looked around several times and clicked his tongue.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s inconvenient not being able to use my abilities… Hey, you, bring me your soul.”
 </p>
 <p>
  From his pale hand, smoke began to emerge.
 </p>
 <p>
  A ghost appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Initially small, the ghost grew as the smoke gathered, and Seong Jihan recognized it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s the Conqueror from the Conqueror’s Mausoleum.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A giant man riding a horse with a beard.
 </p>
 <p>
  He didn’t look as majestic as when Seong Jihan saw him in the Conqueror’s Mausoleum.
 </p>
 <p>
  […Understood.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather, his demeanor seemed rather subdued towards the figure in the robe.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Wasn’t the mission objective to protect the soul of the Conqueror? But he’s already there, isn’t he?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Had the Conqueror’s soul already been captured by Kill the King?
 </p>
 <p>
  Then why did they come here?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan pondered as he watched the disappearing soul of the Conqueror.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon after the Conqueror’s soul disappeared,
 </p>
 <p>
  Another identical soul appeared, and he silently observed the situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Black Magician. Can you revive me?]
 </p>
 <p>
  This newly appeared soul of the Conqueror, unlike the one who brought him, was full of confidence.
 </p>
 <p>
  He referred to the robed figure as the Black Magician and asked confidently.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, yes. Do you want to live again? You’ve already conquered the continent. You left the world too early.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s not for such a trivial reason that I want to be revived.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then what?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [My empire is crumbling. I need to set it right.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You justify with even more trivial reasons. Look at the ghost you brought here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The robed figure casually pointed to the side.
 </p>
 <p>
  The newly arrived soul of the Conqueror turned and looked surprised.
 </p>
 <p>
  [What, why… why am I there?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You from the original world have already been consumed by me. This is a fictional world recreating that moment. You are… yeah, a fake.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s impossible…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “And your real soul here told me his true intentions. Hey, want to say it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  When the robed figure pointed at the real soul, he slowly opened his mouth with a dark expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  […You’re right. I simply wanted to live longer. My will to live never faded, which is why I existed as a spirit in the tomb.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You…! How dare you, a fake, belittle me!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Being deceived by the promise of revival and coming here. Even if it’s me, it’s really foolish. Eventually, you’ll be absorbed into me.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ha! Did you really think I was fooled and came here?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The newly arrived spirit of the Conqueror raised his bow in anger.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I had already suspected it was a trap. I merely played along to crush the intruder with my own hands!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The spirit of the new Conqueror flared up in a blinding white.
 </p>
 <p>
  The White Flames, which were also recorded in the Phoenix’s Arrow, were erupting endlessly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The power that seemed like it could burn this alternate world at any moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the robed figure remained calm.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, he seems pretty strong, doesn’t he? Does the fake seem stronger?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [There are no system constraints in this world.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just play with that guy. I need you to buy time until I catch that other one.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan deduced that the ‘other one’ the robed figure was referring to was himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  After all, this place was inside the BattleNet game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if he was captured and died here, it naturally had nothing to do with his real self.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But for some reason, it doesn’t feel like it would end just like that if I were caught right now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  This opponent felt distinctly different from the NPCs he had encountered before.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was similar to Ariel, aware that this was BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where is the guy who used lightning earlier?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The robed figure fumbled with his gloves, seeming irritated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Beside him, two identical spirits were pulling up white flames and engaging in an intense battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  [For a fake, you harness quite a bit of power!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Huh… Who’s the fake here? All talk.]
 </p>
 <p>
  And as their battle intensified,
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the Veil of the void, the Phoenix’s Arrow held by Seong Jihan started to gradually heat up.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What’s this…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing this, his eyes sparkled.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can make use of this.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [Notes: There has an error in the translation of Dark Elves. To be exact, the species Ariel belongs to. Previously, it was mentioned Ariel is a Dark Elf as we thought that only 2 species of Elves were present, the fairer ones and the dark ones but after further details being uncovered in Chapter 101, Ariel should belong to the third species: The Shadow Elves.]

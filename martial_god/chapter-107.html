 <h3>
  Chapter 107
 </h3>
 <p>
  [Translator – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chapter 107
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Phoenix’s Arrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although its rank is A-grade, when used as an actual spear, its performance surpasses the S-grade level.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite having only five opportunities, it boasted even more potent strength when thrown.
 </p>
 <p>
  If one were to rank it, it could rival the power of SS-grade.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But as those two spirits fight here, the Phoenix’s Arrow is being enhanced.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If things continue this way, it might aim for the power of SSS-grade.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, the item itself might not reach that level of performance.
 </p>
 <p>
  But, combined with Seong Jihan’s strength, it could certainly manifest the power of SSS-grade.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘And if it’s SSS-grade, I can strike the entities of this shadow world.’
 </p>
 <p>
  From the description of the ‘Veil of the Void’ item worn by Seong Jihan, it said attacks below SS-grade can be evaded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Which means, of course, that an SSS-grade attack would hit its mark.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, it’s just the nature of the Veil of the Void; he can still resist the attack, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I have to at least try.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He couldn’t just get caught like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You… a mere imitation, how did you obtain that power?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Submit peacefully, fake.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Whooooosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the white flames intensify, and the heat emanating from the Phoenix’s Arrow reaches its peak,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Now!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, from within the veil, lifted the arrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he did, his camouflage was dispelled, and the robed entity in the shadow world widened its eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “H-how are you here…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Before it could finish, Seong Jihan returned to the original world.
 </p>
 <p>
  Where the robed entity stood was empty, but without hesitation, he threw his arrow, not at where the entity stood, but towards the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nameless Divine Arts, Divine Thunder Decree – Divine Judgement
 </p>
 <p>
  Sssh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s right hand was instantly charred black.
 </p>
 <p>
  The burn spread rapidly up his arm, searing every nerve.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though he hadn’t connected through the BattleNet connector, an intense pain consumed him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It was a success.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather than wincing in pain, he looked up at the sky with a smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  A circular hole opened in the azure sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  Within it, a space filled with blinding white light was revealed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Damn… you fool!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Black Hand swiftly appeared before Seong Jihan, attempting to seize him.
 </p>
 <p>
  One could feel the intense determination, thinking that capturing him was all that mattered.
 </p>
 <p>
  But before the hand could touch him,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  From the space in the sky, a light blinked, and the iron hand was immediately engulfed in radiant light.
 </p>
 <p>
  Up close, it seemed merely covered in light, but from a distance, it looked like a massive spear made of light had impaled the Black Hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Got it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the Divine Thunder Decree martial arts, the Divine Judgement was paramount.
 </p>
 <p>
  This martial art, which summoned a spear of light from the heavens, was the best at removing evil energy.
 </p>
 <p>
  In reality, at his current Silver rank, he wouldn’t even dare to use this superior skill.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, thanks to Sophia’s buff and the enhanced Phoenix’s Arrow, he managed to use it, even if it cost him an arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoooosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Smoke rose from the Black Hand’s metallic body.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How can this…”
 </p>
 <p>
  From there, the robed entity he saw in the shadow world emerged.
 </p>
 <p>
  Its black robe, seemingly catching the light, was burning.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  From the burning robe, a mysterious space was revealed, from which a pure white smoke emerged.
 </p>
 <p>
  No, it wasn’t just smoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  More accurately, the horde of souls that Kill the King controlled was spewing out uncontrollably.
 </p>
 <p>
  Witnessing this unbelievable sight, the robed figure burst into a mad laughter.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Haha. Hahaha. Hahahaha!!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re not a king! Yes… not a king!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon, the robe burst into flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  His existence vanished without a trace, and instead, the souls that sprang out clustered together.
 </p>
 <p>
  They soon became legs, a torso, and arms.
 </p>
 <p>
  A mass made up of countless souls.
 </p>
 <p>
  It had limbs and a body.
 </p>
 <p>
  But a mass without a head.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Was the robe… a means to suppress his power?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan dripped cold sweat as he looked at the opponent.
 </p>
 <p>
  The size of the entity formed from clustered spirits was immense.
 </p>
 <p>
  Its gigantic feet seemed like they could crumble the walls at any moment, and its headless neck reached the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  A scale of a different dimension.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed even larger than the Apostle of Apocalypse, Behemoth.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hahaha! Here, I’ve found the being to be the ‘head’!]
 </p>
 <p>
  A massive red pair of lips appeared on the chest of the now-revealed enemy.
 </p>
 <p>
  It roared joyfully at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, the remaining northern walls instantly turned to dust.
 </p>
 <p>
  All other entities around, except for Seong Jihan, turned into dust and disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  A force comparable to a natural disaster.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even the Seong Jihan of his previous life wouldn’t stand a chance against this foe.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, the world stopped.
 </p>
 <p>
  [An anomaly has been detected in the BattleNet system.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A system message appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The ‘Constellation of the Dead Star’ has intruded into the game through illegitimate means.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Starting the expulsion process.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That’s a Constellation?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the system message identifying the opponent as the ‘Constellation of the Dead Star’, Seong Jihan couldn’t hide his surprise.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was his first time seeing the master of a star.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It seems too weak to be called a Constellation.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the strongest among the monsters he’d seen so far, but the ghostly mass seemed inadequate to hold the title of ‘Constellation’.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That can’t be its full strength.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought as he closely observed the Constellation of the Dead Star.
 </p>
 <p>
  The spirits that made up the body, when seen from afar, looked merely like clustered smoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  But on closer inspection, ghosts wearing crowns were all grotesquely intertwined, wearing agonizing expressions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kill the King.
 </p>
 <p>
  Collecting the souls of kings to form its body?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The scale is different, probably because it’s an otherworldly Undead Legion.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The entire body and limbs were made up of king spirits, forming the Constellation of the Dead Star.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the top part was different.
 </p>
 <p>
  The neck was abruptly cut off in the middle, with no head formed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Recalling the Constellation’s earlier words, Seong Jihan thought, ‘Does it want me to be the head?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Under no circumstances did he want to be part of that.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan was thinking,
 </p>
 <p>
  The system actively expelled the Constellation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter if it was a Constellation, perhaps it couldn’t resist the system.
 </p>
 <p>
  The left arm made of spirits flew off.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though the world was still, the lips on the torso moved actively.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ah. Got it. I’ll go. But before I do, I have a word for him!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom! Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  Hearing those words, as if provoked, the system quickly blew off both its legs.
 </p>
 <p>
  The towering image of the Constellation disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Only the torso and right arm remained.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ah, seriously… It’s the system’s fault for showing weakness! Why are you doing this to me?]
 </p>
 <p>
  As if representing all thieves in the world, even as its body was breaking, the Constellation of the Dead Star continued to blabber.
 </p>

 <p>
  Seeing the unmasked yet flippant Constellation of the Dead Star, Seong Jihan made a brief comment.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So even that kind of guy can become a Constellation.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom! Boom! Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  The right arm disappeared, and the Constellation’s torso rapidly shrank.
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, the lips and that area were the only remains of the Constellation of the Dead Star.
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, he spat something out of his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ah. Got it. I’ll give this to you. So, just have a little chat with that one, okay?]
 </p>
 <p>
  What he spat out was the soul of the conqueror, who had just submitted to the Constellation of the Dead Star.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, for a moment, the system’s expulsion procedure halted.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The player Seong Jihan is given the choice to listen to the story of the Constellation.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you listen to the story, you will receive a tremendous reward from the redeemed soul of the conqueror.
 </p>
 <p>
  Through the system’s mental protection, any mental contamination the opponent can inflict will be completely blocked.
 </p>
 <p>
  The conqueror’s soul is the core soul that constitutes the throat of the Constellation of the Dead Star. His power will be significantly weakened.
 </p>
 <p>
  If player Seong Jihan listens to the story, additional rewards will also be given from the BattleNet system dimension.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The system message had a slightly different tone than usual.
 </p>
 <p>
  It felt like it would be good if he listened to the story.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is it that important to release the conqueror’s soul from the Constellation?’
 </p>
 <p>
  If it constitutes the throat, he must have been a significant king.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan chuckled and nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Oh. Our head. Impressive! You immediately accepted the proposal?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Constellation of the Dead Star played with its lips towards Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s the story?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Head! Join me! You be the head! I’ll be the heart! If you, who possesses the power of thunder, join, we will be complete!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t want to.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Think about it! You can become a COnstellation! And that of a ‘Dead Star’, one of the most powerful in the universe! If we combine, we can make everything equal!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Constellation? That thing?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan never dreamt of becoming the head of a ghost group.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [No. Don’t you know what a Constellation is? How amazing it is… Geez! You can live forever! As the master of a star! Booming around!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Live forever with a noisy guy like you? That’s hell.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [But you’d be the king of that hell! Okay, it’s unfamiliar now. Right. We haven’t become too close? Okay, let’s start with names. What’s your name? Oh right. I should introduce myself first, for this kind of thing. Okay. Hmm…]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Constellation of the Dead Star rambled on.
 </p>
 <p>
  [In this world… Karl Marx and Lenin have similar ideologies to me! Okay. I’m Karl Marx Lenin! You can specially call me Karlein! Wow, you’re the first I’ve allowed to use a nickname! Honored?]
 </p>
 <p>
  He sure talks a lot.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan resolved once more to never fuse with him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay. I’ve heard enough, now go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Huh? Why? Head, you’re not fusing?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, not wanting to reply, lightly raised his middle finger.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then the lips made a fuss.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Oh my! That gesture… In this world, it means you want to merge with me, right?! I knew it~ You really wanted to be with me, right? Okay, come into my mouth?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Shreeek!
 </p>
 <p>
  Karlein opened his mouth wide and flicked his tongue.
 </p>
 <p>
  He’s really hard to communicate with.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now that I’ve heard the story, can you get rid of him?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan said this,
 </p>
 <p>
  The expulsion process of the system began as if it had been waiting.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang! Bang! Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  The body around the lips flew away.
 </p>
 <p>
  The red lips began to wrinkle.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ah. It hurts! I’m going. I said I’m going!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Unable to withstand the system’s onslaught, the lips, trembling, bid their final goodbye to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Head! I’ll come to see you next time! I’ll find you somehow!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [A strong penalty is imposed on the Constellation of the Dead Star.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Constellation of the Dead Star is prohibited from accessing this world.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A BattleNet system message appeared in response to his words.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Try to stop me! The head! Is! Mine!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Leaving behind a final statement filled with obsession, Karlein disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the world that had stopped began to move again.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the same time,
 </p>
 <p>
  [I-I… Am I really free?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The conqueror’s soul, spat out by the throne, looked at its body with disbelief.
 </p>
 <p>

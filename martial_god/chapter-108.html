  Chapter 108
 </h3>
 <p>
  [Translator – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  Chapter 108
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s true… My connection with him is severed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Conqueror’s soul, with a touched expression, grasped his own spiritual form.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Thank you. Truly, thank you! I can finally perish!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Was his time with the Constellation of the Dead Star really that horrendous?
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as he was freed, he immediately tried to obliterate his own soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Conqueror’s soul began to turn transparent in an instant, trying to vanish.
 </p>
 <p>
  But then.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ah. The reward… Yes. I must give it! All of it!]
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed a system message had popped up, urging him to bestow the reward even in death. He halted his own obliteration.
 </p>
 <p>
  [But there’s too much of me tainted by that bastard…]
 </p>
 <p>
  With a dissatisfied look, the Conqueror’s soul reached into his own body in various places.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, he pulled out a pure white flame from his chest.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Is this the weapon you used? Yes… My Phoenix’s Arrow.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Phoenix’s Arrow, which became a medium for the ‘Divine Judgement’, was stuck in the ground, burnt completely black.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Phoenix’s Arrow, now unusable due to the loss of its five casting chances, was approached by the Conqueror’s soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  [By the first Khan’s command; O Phoenix, spread your wings.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoooosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Phoenix’s Arrow, as if to turn it completely to ashes, was wrapped in a pure white flame.
 </p>
 <p>
  One by one, as the flames intensified, the Phoenix’s Arrow not only returned to its original form, but grew even bigger.
 </p>
 <p>
  The enlarged Phoenix’s Arrow then transformed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “A flag…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The arrow changed into a form adorned with a phoenix at its tip.
 </p>
 <p>
  The cloth forming the flag was made of pure white flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  The energy emanating from the Phoenix Flag now held a heat several times more intense than before.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Phoenix Flag. This is all that the tainted me can offer. Thank you, my savior.]
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, beside the Conqueror’s soul, which was becoming transparent in an instant, the in-game version of the Conqueror’s soul, who had been watching with distaste, spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You, how could you give the Phoenix Flag… As a descendant of the Phoenix, one must always possess it!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You try being in my place. If there’s salvation, I would give up everything, liver and intestines included.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ha!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [So… it’s finally my time to perish! Hahaha! Thank you! Thank you!]
 </p>
 <p>
  In such a hurry.
 </p>
 <p>
  After giving the Phoenix Flag, the Conqueror’s soul set himself on fire.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even in his annihilation, a broad smile graced his lips, revealing his sheer joy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before he completely vanished, he left a word of advice to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Never… get involved with him. No matter what sweet words he utters, never… approach him.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have no intention of doing so.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Keep that thought, even in death. The Dead Star… it’s a place far more terrifying than you can imagine.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwish!
 </p>
 <p>
  With those words, the Conqueror’s soul completely vanished.
 </p>
 <p>
  It signaled the end of the Silver promotion match that took place in a special map.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Player Seong Jihan has subdued the special boss ‘Black Hand’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [With the victory of the Northern team, the game will end soon.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile,
 </p>
 <p>
  There was an uproar in the commentator’s booth about this outcome.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Moments ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  – What… What just happened? Christopher! Seong Jihan has disappeared! Can you explain?!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Well… This is the first time I’ve seen such a scene…
 </p>
 <p>
  – I remember you saying something similar during the bronze rank-up match a month ago! If a commentator says that, you might not get your salary!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Haha! Looks like I might get fired because of Seong. But other commentators wouldn’t know either. If they had to commentate on Seong’s matches, they’d probably get fired too!
 </p>
 <p>
  Following the disappearance of Black Hand, Seong Jihan’s figure had vanished without a trace, leaving the commentators clueless.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since they couldn’t broadcast the void, all they could see was an empty space.
 </p>
 <p>
  – What about the South…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ah, only Barren and Wang Lin remain!
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">

   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  – A mass assault surely does wonders.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Well, we’ve seen the South’s situation, shall we return to the North?
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  On the southern battlefield.
 </p>
 <p>
  The top of the wall had been completely occupied by the undead, with only Barren and Wang Lin remaining.
 </p>
 <p>
  With all their might, they held against the Undead Legion.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the camera briefly showed the fierce battle, and then immediately shifted the camera’s focus.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Hey, where did Seong go? He disappeared; what is happening?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Oh right! Seong Jihan had a private channel! It’s still on, let’s switch to that for a moment! Ah…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Intending to broadcast from Seong Jihan’s channel, the caster gasped upon seeing the new screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This scene cannot be viewed in the tutorial.]
 </p>
 <p>
  BattleNet, the combat game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here, even with the most brutal scenes unfolding, there had never been a “viewing unavailable” warning.
 </p>
 <p>
  But now, this message appears…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Christopher, is this the first time we’ve seen this message? Have you seen this before?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Well… this is the first time for me as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Are we getting used to such surprises?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ha! But maybe the boss will let this one slide? We’re seeing quite different scenes today!
 </p>
 <p>
  A situation akin to a broadcasting error.
 </p>
 <p>
  To bypass the situation, the caster filled the time with concern over Christopher’s job security.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon after,
 </p>
 <p>
  – Oh! Seong Jihan reappeared!
 </p>
 <p>
  – But… he’s throwing his spear into the sky?!
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly appearing, Seong Jihan threw the arrow in the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  It transformed into a giant spear of light that pierced through the Black Hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Seong!! Jihan!! He tears apart his opponent!!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Seong has gone mad! Doesn’t BattleNet need more balance adjustments?!
 </p>
 <p>
  – It’s as if a judgment is being delivered from the heavens! It’s surprising he’s even in a silver promotion match!!
 </p>
 <p>
  The caster and commentator shouted at the top of their lungs.
 </p>
 <p>
  The spear of light descending from the sky held such grandeur that it overawed all who watched.
 </p>
 <p>
  But then, as Black Hand disappeared and a figure in a robe emerged, the screen suddenly turned dark, showing only one white message:
 </p>
 <p>
  [This scene cannot be viewed in the tutorial.]
 </p>
 <p>
  – …Christopher? What’s this? Can you explain?
 </p>
 <p>
  – I don’t know! I genuinely don’t! Bring someone here who knows!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Well, sadly, I think there’s no one!
 </p>
 <p>
  The appearance of Karlein, the Constellation of the Dead Star, was not broadcasted, only a dark screen was broadcast.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  After a few minutes,
 </p>
 <p>
  – The southern camera feed isn’t transitioning either!
 </p>
 <p>
  – It’s totally frozen! This is a massive broadcasting blunder!
 </p>
 <p>
  – It’s not our fault, of course! It’s BattleNet’s mistake!
 </p>
 <p>
  – So even cosmic hyper-technology can make mistakes!
 </p>
 <p>
  While the caster and commentator were chatting,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Player Seong Jihan has subdued the special boss ‘Black Hand’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [With the victory of the Northern team, the game will end soon.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Two messages appeared on the dark screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then the game ended.
 </p>
 <p>
  – What… it’s over just like that?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Yes, it seems so. It says it’s over!
 </p>
 <p>
  The caster and commentator, equally puzzled, witnessed the abrupt end of the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  They had broadcast countless Top 100 promotion matches, but this was a first.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps a similar broadcast glitch occurred last month during Seong Jihan’s Top 100 promotion match.
 </p>
 <p>
  But then, only the screen went dark; they never saw the “viewing unavailable” message…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Why did the promotion match end like this…?
 </p>
 <p>
  – How on earth did Seong suppress Black Hand?!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Christopher, if you ask me, who do I ask?
 </p>
 <p>
  The one supposed to comment and analyze was raising questions about today’s game.
 </p>
 <p>
  The internet was equally chaotic.
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  – What the heck happened? What did Seong Jihan do?
 </p>
 <p>
  – I have no idea. I was watching the promotion match through Seong Jihan’s channel, and at some point, it just kept showing “viewing unavailable.”
 </p>
 <p>
  – Shouldn’t we complain about this broadcasting error?
 </p>
 <p>
  – To whom?
 </p>
 <p>
  – ESPN.
 </p>
 <p>
  – It’s clear that it’s BattleNet’s issue, not theirs lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers, who were debating the cause of the broadcast glitch, were all the more riled up when Seong Jihan used the Divine Judgment, another “viewing unavailable” message appeared, and the game ended.
 </p>
 <p>
  – What? It’s over?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Is this really the end? Seong Jihan won? Another victory?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Of course, he won. Didn’t you see the hole in the sky earlier? He’s a crazy monster. How can Silver even use such a thing?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Aaaaah! What’s up with BattleNet? They said they’d balance it! How can they adjust the balance like this? BattleNet can be viewed even when there is no electricity but they can’t balance a game properly?
 </p>
 <p>
  – This is all due to the majesty of Seong Jihan…
 </p>
 <p>
  – We should just believe and follow. Tsk tsk… Don’t question his limits. If you’re Korean, please bet on Seong Jihan!
 </p>
 <p>
  – But the user’s ID is ‘Daegi Guild Master Lee Hayeon’… HOXY…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sure, Guild Master! I’m the Guild Master! The Guild Master of Daegi Guild! Why is the Guild Master not betting on the Boss, and losing all the assets!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… Miss, just stop it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon, about to type in fury, was quickly stopped by Lim Gayeong.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ahh… I’m crazy… I should’ve just trusted Boss. Why did I lose my mind…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon buried her face in front of the keyboard, tears shimmering.
 </p>
 <p>
  If she had just followed the prediction Seong Jihan had provided, she would have recovered all the money she lost and become even richer.
 </p>
 <p>
  Why didn’t she properly follow? What a mess.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why use your brain?! Just follow the Boss! Why are you thinking, Lee Hayeon!”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That’s what I’m saying.’ Lim Gayeong thought, pushing the keyboard away from Lee Hayeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  You only realize the right answer after losing money.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking at the despondent Lee Hayeon, Lim Gayeong felt pity, even though she had bet the opposite way.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s better this way.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The young lady shouldn’t gamble.
 </p>
 <p>
  She’s already squandered all her assets, but she’s still heavily involved in the Daegi Guild with Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  If she just works hard in that field, she’ll recover all the money she lost in no time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Taking this event as a lesson, people should live more honestly…
 </p>
 <p>
  [Due to a flaw in today’s BattleNet system, we deeply apologize for any inconvenience.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Due to an in-game error, fair betting was not achieved.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Compensation will be given to those who bet in this game through the BattleNet betting system.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Bets on player Seong Jihan will be paid out as is, but bets on other players will be refunded in GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon, who had her head down, suddenly shot up.
 </p>
 <p>
  What’s this about?
 </p>
 <p>
  They’re compensating?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course, BattleNet…! Right! Everyone makes mistakes! But it’s how you fix them!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow, if they pay out to those who bet on Seong Jihan, the GP loss would be huge…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not my money! I don’t care!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon, feeling like she’s come back from the dead, brought back the keyboard Lim Gayeong had pushed away.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Aaaaahㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ BattleNet! I love you!!
 </p>
 <p>
  – BattleNet is a god! BattleNet is a god! BattleNet is a god!
 </p>
 <p>
  – The compensation is really here? This is crazy ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
 </p>
 <p>
  – This is the pinnacle of hyper technology! The epitome of god games!!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wow… today’s game is spectacular in so many ways.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I… I was right after all!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, you were wrong. Very wrong, Miss. BattleNet saved you once, so just stop it now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, this is a sign to continue…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking at the dazed Lee Hayeon, Lim Gayeong sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even after getting compensated today, it won’t be long before she loses all her assets.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Sigh, I should earn more.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s inevitable.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking she’d have to keep on milking the situation, Lim Gayeong shook her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, Seong Jihan…
 </p>
 <p>
  [Due to a flaw in today’s BattleNet system, we deeply apologize for any inconvenience.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [A special reward will be given to the player ‘Seong Jihan’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Given the magnitude of the infiltration by a Constellation, Seong Jihan was able to receive a reward message that was completely different from his usual gameplay.
 </p>

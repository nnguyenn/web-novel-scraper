  <strong>
   Chapter 11
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Human Resources Department, 3rd Division head office of the Divergent Guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Pfft, hahaha! So you asked for his number,and he said what? He doesn’t know his own number?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Division head Lee Hayeon burst into laughter as she watched the video Lim Gayeong had brought.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I mean, I don’t look as beautiful as Miss and I look kinda masculine. So, it’s understandable.” Lim Gayeong said with a stern face.
 </p>
 <p>
  With her short hair, tall stature, and well-defined muscles, she did give off a somewhat boyish vibe, But that was a separate issue from looking ‘masculine.’
 </p>
 <p>
  “Gosh… She really has no idea how popular she is in the guild.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Hayeon smirked and playfully clapped her hands for emphasis.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Gayeong, don’t say things like that elsewhere or you’ll get in trouble.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, I know that very well. Even in high school, only girls liked me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You went to an all-girls school.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, that’s true, but…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Smack!
 </p>
 <p>
  Ha-yeon clapped her hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright, enough. That guy is just weird. Let’s wrap up this issue.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…You were the one who was laughing at me, Miss.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Never mind.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Tap, tap.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Hayeon was sporting a smile at the corner of her mouth, she fervently typed on her keyboard.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anyway, Seong Jihan, this person. After looking at the data you brought, I thought we definitely need to recruit them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even if he’s a support class?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. With this level of skill, we should have him on board first. Before other guilds take an interest. And, you know what? I now remember who this person is.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You know him?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Hayeon gestured to Gayeong and pointed at the monitor.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Look at this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is…”
 </p>
 <p>
  What entered Gayeong’s eyes was a video channel.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Battlenet Match Prediction Specialist, Mister Seong’s Channel
 </p>
 <p>
  “…You still watch these kinds of broadcasts, Miss.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gayeong looked at Hayeon with a cold gaze.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though she came from a wealthy family, why was she subscribed to such a gambling-oriented channel?
 </p>
 <p>
  Hayeon quickly clapped her hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This person is quite accurate. Even though the broadcasts are sporadic, if they did it properly, they could’ve become famous in the match prediction community.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The match prediction community, you say. Sounds like an illegal betting site.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, This isn’t about betting. Battlenet match prediction involves collecting data and making judgments… Well, it’s a sophisticated form of analysis, anyway!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sigh… Alright then. What does this gambler have to do with Seong Jihan?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, look at this, here!”
 </p>
 <p>
  She quickly moved the mouse.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then the playlist for the channel ‘Seong’ scrolled down.
 </p>
 <p>
  “In the 7th video here, this person’s face appeared briefly. I thought it looked cleaner than I expected and just moved on, but it turns out he looks similar to Seong Jihan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hold on a second, Miss.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gayeong urgently stopped Ha-yeon from scrolling the mouse wheel down.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh? Why?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Look at the title of the live broadcast right at the top!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh, why would this person suddenly do a broadcast? It’s been a while… Huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Hayeon initially raised her head absentmindedly, then widened her eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  The title of the live video.
 </p>
 <p>
  It contained content she could never have imagined.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Daughter and Brother-in-law of the Sword King addressing the Current Situation and Sharing the Conversation with the Sword King.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sword King’s brother-in-law…?”
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin’s penthouse living room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, dressed in black, was setting up the camera.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Phew, it was tough to persuade her.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Donating the building in Gangnam that her father had left her. It wasn’t an easy decision.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle… You are still not sober, huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  It was only natural for Yoon Seah to say that.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this situation, where even swearing would be forgivable, her mild response felt quite generous.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I couldn’t reveal that I came from the future, but…”
 </p>
 <p>
  He narrated the worst-case scenarios that would unfold one by one.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t that a bit exaggerated?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah half-asked, to which Seong Jihan countered with arguments like not being able to pay the inheritance tax, him having had a precognitive dream, and how things would get serious if he held onto it.
 </p>
 <p>
  After all the talking and persuading, he finally got his way.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Fine, I got it. Well, Uncle, you’re my only family now. I’ll trust you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Ugh. It would have been better if you asked them to just take half of the building. Donating to the country, seriously?”
 </p>
 <p>
  While grumbling, Yoon Seah delegated full authority to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, Seong Jihan was able to execute his plan after returning to the past.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, it’s not showing up on my phone. Why isn’t it working…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Setting up the camera seemed unfamiliar to him.
 </p>
 <p>
  He scratched his head while looking at his phone screen and the camera.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This camera. It worked fine on the Battle Tube last time…”
 </p>
 <p>
  BattleTube.
 </p>
 <p>
  An in-house streaming system and video platform exclusive to Battlenet.
 </p>
 <p>
  Equipped with hyper-technology that allowed videos to play even without an internet connection, BattleTube boasted unrivaled market dominance, overshadowing all other video platforms on Earth.
 </p>
 <p>
  And on the other side of the camera.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, dressed in black like Seong Jihan, stood with her arms crossed, watching her uncle’s appearance as if it were something unbelievable.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Since when did Uncle become such a good actor?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The BattleTube window on Yoon Seah’s smartphone.
 </p>
 <p>
  The stream was clearly visible, with people complaining about how Seong Ji-han’s face wasn’t showing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s this guy doing?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s so frustrating.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this just clickbait?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But the house does look like the Sword King’s place.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, I saw it on Sword King’s special show.”
 </p>
 <p>
  And the chat kept scrolling.
 </p>
 <p>
  People were berating Seong Jihan, who was struggling visibly.
 </p>
 <p>
  If only it weren’t for that annoying title, he would have gone live immediately.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Daughter and brother-in-law of the Sword King addressing the Current Situation and Sharing the Conversation with the Sword King.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The title was too long at first glance.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the mention of the Sword King’s daughter and brother-in-law had people who were previously angered by the Sword King’s interview entering the stream one by one.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait… It really looks like the Sword King’s living room, doesn’t it?”

   And as Seong Jihan, who was putting on a convincing act, continued, an achievement point notification popped up before his eyes.

 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   “Just as I thought.”
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   BattleTube was also part of Battle Net. Here, too, one could earn achievement points. Viewership numbers, subscriber counts, likes, dislikes, total views of a video, and more.The possibilities for earning achievement points on BattleTube were boundless.

   “It’s going to be hard to break the ‘dislike’ achievement. I’ll have to receive a lot this time.”
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   While a video with too many dislikes would result in losses when converted to GP on Battle Tube, Seong Jihan didn’t care much. Achievement points were more important than GP.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   Especially now, when he could only achieve a Bronze rank at best, he needed to break as many achievements as possible through major issues.

   He had managed to achieve both the simultaneous viewers achievement and the disliked achievement.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   People had come to see it because he had revealed his stance, but after watching him complain for two hours about the screen not showing, they couldn’t help but hit the dislike button.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   If the content hadn’t been related to Sword King, 99% of the viewers would have left by now.

   “30,000 people? They should hit the dislike button a bit more.”
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   On the other hand, Seong Ji-han was regretful that he hadn’t achieved the ‘dislike’ achievement (2).
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   However, it was time to stop the broadcast now.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>

   Yoon Seah, watching from behind the camera, couldn’t help but be impressed by her uncle’s remarkable acting.

   “His face is good, but he’s even better at acting…”
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>

  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">

 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">

 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   Seong Jihan bowed his head deeply towards the camera.With a frustrated expression, he sat down at the desk and chair he had set up beforehand.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   “Now then, Sword King’s brother-in-law, me, Seong Jihan, and…”

  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   At Seong Jihan’s gesture, Yoon Seah walked towards him with a somber expression. Even she, who had been admiring her uncle’s expression management, was truly impressed by his acting skills as he began performing.

   In this streaming video that held the attention of the masses, as Seong Jihan introduced himself, multiple messages appeared in the chat.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   “Seong Jihan?”
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   “Top-ranked in Gangnam 1 tutorial!”
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   While guild officials who surveyed even the Bronze League were impressed by Seong Jihan, ordinary people had a different perspective.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   “Top-ranked in the tutorial? So what? Isn’t he just in the Bronze League? At least he should be in Gold.”
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   No matter how much he was from Gangnam 1, Bronze was still Bronze. This was the perception of regular individuals, which differed from that of scouts and hardcore fans who would look into players even below this level.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   “Right. What’s important now isn’t the likes of Bronze.”
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   Contrary to the excitement of the scouts, regular viewers were not at all curious about Seong Jihan achieving first place.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   What they were curious about was information regarding the Sword King. The pride of South Korea, ranked third in the world. Did Sword King Yoon Sejin really abandon his own country and go to Japan? That was what mattered.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   “First… I will tell you the content of the conversation between my brother-in-law and my niece.”
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   Seong Jihan looked at Yoon Seah with a serious expression.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   In response, Yoon Seah, who had been chewing her lips, carefully placed her phone on the desk.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   From there, the recorded conversation between Yoon Sejin and Yoon Seah was played without any editing.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   “[Seah.]”
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   “Dad!? Is it really you, Dad? What’s with the interview earlier? Why are you going to Japan without telling me anything?!”
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   “I’m sorry. Dad… fell in love with someone.”
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   “…What? Love?”

 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">

 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   -Wow, I waited 18 minutes for this… This is insane…
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   -Is that really the Sword King’s voice?
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   -Yes, I can vouch that She’s a part of the Sword King family.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   The Sword King went to Japan because he fell in love?
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   To viewers, the content of the conversation was so absurd that they couldn’t stop expressing their astonishment and criticizing the Sword King.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   “…It’s a joke, right? Love?”
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   “Japanese women are more beautiful than anyone in the world.”
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   Yoon Se-jin’s voice was brighter than ever. In contrast, Yoon Seah’s voice was thoroughly somber.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   “Ah, Dad… Please… No, right?”
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   “…”
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   “Well, okay. You can Remarry! It’s okay to remarry. Mom… Yeah. Became a stone statue. S-since she’s dead… you must be lonely too. Okay. The new mom is a Japanese woman? That’s fine…”
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   Gulp.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   Perhaps it was an attempt to hold back her emotions.In the recorded voice, Yoon Seah briefly swallowed her saliva. Her voice grew even more melancholic.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   “Whatever you want, I’m fine with that. Even if you want to remarry…I’ll agree. But… But… We don’t need to go to Japan, right?”
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   “That’s the condition for her to accept my proposal.”
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   “What, what…!?”
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   “And.”
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   Yoon Sejin paused for a moment.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   As if resolved, he continued in a resolute voice.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   “There’s another condition she has. She wants me to leave my daughter in Korea.”

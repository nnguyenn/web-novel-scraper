  <strong>
   Chapter 110
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  [Another victory! Seong Jihan effortlessly conquers the TOP 100!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [10 vs 90? Even if it were 1 vs 99, the outcome wouldn’t have changed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [An unprecedented broadcasting accident on BattleNet! ‘This scene cannot be viewed in the tutorial.’ What on earth happened?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Want to earn money? Bet on Seong Jihan! Koreans laughing all the way.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Limitation – what does that mean?’ Seong Jihan just 2 months after his debut.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Korean portal sites were flooded with news related to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even a day after the match, there was no sign of Seong Jihan-related articles diminishing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow. Uncle, it’s chaos even overseas?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Probably because of the broadcasting incident.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially this time, due to the unprecedented broadcasting accident on BattleNet, foreign portal sites were no different.
 </p>
 <p>
  The number of subscribers to Seong Jihan’s channel surpassed 2 million just a day after this match.
 </p>
 <p>
  And it seemed to be growing fast enough to aim for 3 million soon.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, by the way… Sophia is coming to Korea?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sophia? What are you talking about?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Look at this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah showed Seong Jihan a news article.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘I’m coming to Korea for a meal!’ Sophia. Posts a photo taken inside an airplane.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia, making a V sign inside the plane.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her expression was innocently cheerful.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No… She didn’t mention anything to me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “She did talk, during the match. She seemed really interested in you, judging from the broadcast.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Saying that, Yoon Seah narrowed her eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Also, Uncle, she’s the same age as me, you know? 19.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…She’s a teenager?”
 </p>
 <p>
  She was in her twenties the last time they met in his previous life.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her appearance hasn’t changed much since then, so he had no idea about her age.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, on the day you treat her, I’ll leave the house. Just don’t go out and sleep elsewhere. What if you get caught by the paparazzi?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, what do you mean ‘leave’? I’m not interested.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even though she’s that pretty?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia had a face that perfectly matched the Western beauty standard, with blonde hair and blue eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s probably why she’s enjoying superstar-level popularity even though she hasn’t been in America First for long.
 </p>
 <p>
  The same was true for her popularity in Korea.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wow, Seong Jihan is crossing lines again.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Sophia is off-limits, dude!
 </p>
 <p>
  – What’s he doing bringing a teenager?
 </p>
 <p>
  – She’s the one coming, you know?
 </p>
 <p>
  – If she’s 19, isn’t that fine?
 </p>
 <p>
  – There’s a problem! There just is!
 </p>
 <p>
  The comments on Seong Jihan’s articles felt different than usual.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Being pretty and being interested are two different things.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Uncle, you don’t happen to like men, do you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you talking about?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Do I have to doubt my own sexual orientation just because I said I’m not interested in Sophia?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan chuckled and shook his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “More importantly, let’s check your Gift again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, because of the upgrade conditions?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah showed Seong Jihan her Gift, which had been upgraded to E-grade.
 </p>
 <p>
  The effect of the upgraded Gift she showed was simple but powerful.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Gift – Late Bloomer (Grade: E – Upgrade condition not met)]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Upgrades the basic BattleNet system by one level.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [F rank effect: Increase game participation by 1 per day
 </p>
 <p>
  Natural status growth rate increased by 100%]
 </p>
 <p>
  [E rank effect: Additional stat effect changed to +2]
 </p>
 <p>
  [To upgrade the Gift to the next level, special conditions must be met.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The additional stat changed from +1 to 2.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was similar to Barren, who gained +2 stats through two status windows.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the early stages, the difference isn’t significant.
 </p>
 <p>
  But once you reach over level 200, the gap in attainable stat points grows immensely, which was a tremendous benefit.

 <p>
  ‘If E rank is this powerful… I can’t even imagine how it’ll be later on.’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Late Bloomer’ seemed already bloomed.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t unreasonable for Seong Jihan to think so given its potential.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Conditions for Upgrade to D rank]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Be the sole owner of the Late Bloomer Gift on the planet. (Currently 2)]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Among the Late Bloomer Gift holders, be the first to reach the Gold Player rank.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [One of the two conditions must be met.
 </p>
 <p>
  When one person’s Late Bloomer Gift is upgraded to D rank, the other person’s Late Bloomer Gift disappears automatically.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The upgrade conditions bothered him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I didn’t know there was another person with the Late Bloomer Gift besides me. Who could it be?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah spoke calmly while looking at the upgrade conditions.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Seong Jihan’s expression hardened.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Did Xin Youhwa already have Late Bloomer?’
 </p>
 <p>
  In his previous life, Xin Youhwa from China had the world rank of #2.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her rapid rise in the rankings was astonishing, and everyone was constantly worried about when she would surpass the #1, Barren.
 </p>
 <p>
  Little information was publicly available about Xin Youhwa, so Seong Jihan didn’t know much about her.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ve heard rumors linking her with the Triad.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Triad, a criminal organization widespread in Hong Kong and the Chinese-speaking world.
 </p>
 <p>
  Xin Youhwa was said to be the daughter of a high-ranking Triad member and played a significant role in the organization.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although she strongly denied it and the Chinese government vowed to counter such rumors, the Triad connection was buried.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, unfavorable rumors about her persisted.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Her skills weren’t that great.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Like the #1 Barren, the #2 Xin Youhwa wasn’t exceptionally skilled.
 </p>
 <p>
  As an archer, she felt overpowering because of her inflated stats rather than outstanding control.
 </p>
 <p>
  In China, many believed Heavenly Demon Wang Lin was their true #1 player until his death.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘In my previous life, she must’ve easily met that condition after Seah died…’
 </p>
 <p>
  With Yoon Seah, who had the Late Bloomer, dead, she would’ve satisfied the first condition.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recalled the painful memories from that time.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t until about a year after Yoon Seah’s death that Xin Youhwa became well-known in Korea.
 </p>
 <p>
  In China, a rising star named ‘Xin Youhwa’ emerged with the Gift, Late Bloomer!
 </p>
 <p>
  Until then, it was widely known as the worthless Gift of Yoon Seah, the traitor’s daughter.
 </p>
 <p>
  But when a Chinese player with Late Bloomer suddenly rose to Platinum rank and rapidly moved up to Diamond, people were shocked.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wow, turns out Late Bloomer was a great Gift?nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
 </p>
 <p>
  – Why did Yoon Seah commit suicide? Such a waste lol
 </p>
 <p>
  – Must be regretting in the afterlife ㅠㅠ
 </p>
 <p>
  – That’s too harsh, someone died.
 </p>
 <p>
  – The guy above used to trash talk Yoon Seah lol. Pretending to be nice now.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  After seeing such comments on the news, Seong Jihan, filled with disdain for the public, stopped following news about Xin Youhwa.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he knew he would reincarnate, he would’ve kept an eye out.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This time, we need to keep Late Bloomer on our side.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It would be better for Earth if Yoon Seah has it rather than Xin Youhwa, who’s like Barren.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking this, Seong Jihan told Yoon Seah confidently,
 </p>
 <p>
  “You need to keep partying with me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Am I continuing to get carried by Uncle?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. We need to reach Gold before the other holder of Late Bloomer. Play one round with me and another one solo. Let’s go with this strategy for the next month.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it. We can’t lose the Gift!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s aim for the October promotion.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay!”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s words, Yoon Seah nodded with determination.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I wonder where Xin Youhwa is right now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering the previous life, Xin Youhwa probably wasn’t at a higher level than Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  She started making her mark a few years later.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the variable was the broadcast that Yoon Seah previously did.
 </p>
 <p>
  The broadcast revealed that the Gift ‘Late Bloomer’ had value, so if Xin Youhwa saw it, she might’ve started accelerating.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If she’s in Bronze, there’s nothing to worry about, but if she’s in Silver….”
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter what it means, he had to prevent her from leveling up.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan pondered, he hesitated.
 </p>
 <p>
  He might not be the only one having these thoughts.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I should also prepare for how the other side reacts.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Just like the rumors from his past life, if Xin Youhwa was related to Traid.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was also a possibility that she might threaten Yoon Seah’s life.
 </p>

 <p>
  In preparation for such a situation, Seong Jihan opened his inventory and handed the Veil of the Void to Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What’s this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s an item called the Veil of the Void.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Due to the condition that one would be buried in the void if left unattended for a long time, Seong Jihan had refrained from giving it to Yoon Seah until he could determine more about it.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, considering her gift attribute, it seemed like a good idea to have a refuge in case of emergency.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Use it only when you’re in danger in reality, not during regular game time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Eh, why would I be in danger in reality?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You never know. The other player with ‘Late Bloomer’ might target you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh… right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “And for a month, try not to go outside. Be cautious. I’ll handle shopping.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No outings?… To that extent?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just endure for a month.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah thought her uncle was being overly protective.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s just for a month.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Right. There’s no harm in being careful.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood, uncle.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good. Starting today?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But what about Sophia?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why mention Sophia here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t I need to empty the house for her?”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Yoon Seah chuckled, Seong Jihan playfully flicked his finger as if thinking of a good idea.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nonsense. Ah, right. Let’s go eat together. I can’t leave you alone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Eh, are you inviting me on your date? That’s… weird.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What date? Didn’t I say I’m not interested?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But you’re still buying her dinner.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “She came all the way to Korea, I can’t just ignore her.”
 </p>
 <p>
  While there were no romantic feelings, there was still affection from the time they were guildmates.
 </p>
 <p>
  It would be rude to leave a girl who came all the way to Korea hanging.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I could just stay home alone…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What if someone targets you while you’re alone?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What sort of attacker? And if I accompany you, what will Sophia think of me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s just eat together. Otherwise, I’ll tell Sophia we can’t meet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon Seong Jihan’s insistence, Yoon Seah reluctantly agreed with a hesitant face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sigh. Fine… Let’s go. What an inconvenience.”
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  In a building in Hong Kong.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the Celestial Guild office occupying the entire 44th floor, a girl was reading a report.
 </p>
 <p>
  With light makeup and a youthful face, the noticeably short and petite girl looked too young to be an adult woman.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this report true?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, young lady.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The subject of the report was Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  The report suggested that due to Seong Jihan’s support, Yoon Seah was likely to be promoted to Gold in October.
 </p>
 <p>
  The young lady smirked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That won’t do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kill her.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kill, you say?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite looking like an innocent teenager, she casually mentioned death.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. I don’t think I can promote by October.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The owner of the ‘Late Bloomer’ Gift in China, Xin Youhwa, said with a bright expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do we really need to kill her? She’s quite well-known. The focus will be on us…”
 </p>
 <p>
  A bulky, menacing-looking man seemed more hesitant about the killing than she did.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, kidnap her? That might be even harder than killing. Just ambush and kill her in one go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Start immediately. Kill her before October 25th. Definitely.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then take the men and go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching the man leave with his head bowed, Xin Youhwa tilted her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Can they handle it?’
 </p>
 <p>
  She felt uneasy about how uncertain the men were.
 </p>
 <p>
  If she just left the assassination to those guys, it wouldn’t suffice.
 </p>
 <p>
  She picked up her phone.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Daddy~!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes, dear. What is it?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Um, I have a favor to ask!”
 </p>
 <p>
  She began the call with a voice full of playfulness.
 </p>

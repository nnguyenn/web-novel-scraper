  <strong>
   Chapter 111
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  In the Daegi Guild office.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon greeted Seong Jihan with an excited look on her face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Boss. The guild effect has suddenly changed! All options increased by 4 levels… Did you do something?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. BattleNet gave me a guild-related item as compensation for the last incident.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon’s eyes sparkled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now we can accept 20 more guild members. Should we start right away?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Since the growth rate effect has also increased, let’s charge extra for it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With the guild member expansion level increased, the Daegi Guild can now accommodate 20 more members.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the enhanced Stat Increase and Growth Rate Increase effects, they could now raise the rental fee and bring in more players.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I understand. Then, let’s start with a valuation of 7 billion, and we’ll proceed with an auction.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “All twenty spots?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehe… Word has already spread among the rented players who experienced benefits.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Players like Barren, Wang Lin, and Sophia, who paid hefty rental fees, were quite satisfied with the results.
 </p>
 <p>
  Through the Growth Rate Increase, they gained additional stats ranging from +2 to +4.
 </p>
 <p>
  Word of mouth spread, and many renowned guilds had already been inquiring, offering more money to accommodate their players.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even top-tier players are showing interest.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How top-tier?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Diamond rank.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was slightly surprised.
 </p>
 <p>
  Diamond rank meant they were among the top league players.
 </p>
 <p>
  To survive the fierce competition of the Diamond League, an all-stats additional effect from the guild option was essential.
 </p>
 <p>
  And yet they would give that up to join the Daegi Guild?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are they fine with not fully benefiting from the all-stats effect?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. They said that even without the all-stats effect, if they can hold out in the league and enjoy the growth rate buff effect, they’re content.”
 </p>
 <p>
  To hold out in the Diamond League without the all-stats effect, one would need an unparalleled gift.
 </p>
 <p>
  That would mean they are top-tier players who dominate the league.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Maybe the first-generation rankers will gather in the Daegi Guild.’
 </p>
 <p>
  First-generation rankers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Apart from the Sword King, Seong Jihan didn’t know much about them.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was because most of them died shortly after the tutorial ended and the Space League opened.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They were severely trapped by the scheming of the World Tree Alliance.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The elves were the main culprits behind the near-extermination of the first-generation rankers.
 </p>
 <p>
  The void left by their death was so large that Earth suffered continuous defeats until the rise of the second-generation rankers like Barren.
 </p>
 <p>
  Earth, having suffered too many defeats, was unable to move up from the bottom of the league.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘We need to keep as many first-generation rankers alive this time.’
 </p>
 <p>
  For that to happen, the Daegi Guild needed to accept not only promising rookies but also rankers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if they were from the Diamond League, they still had potential to grow.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If Diamond players are coming, please accommodate them as best as you can.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood. Boss, about the auction schedule…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You can decide, Hayeon. I have some work to do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, a date with Miss Sophia?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon teased with a sly glance.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Lucky you~ I work day and night without a break… while you date a blonde beauty~.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon openly jeered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan had a trump card to silence her.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ve earned a lot from working hard, right? This time was quite profitable, wasn’t it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What- what are you talking about?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The bet I advised you on.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He knew she didn’t bet on him, but he pretended not to know.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh. Uh, the bet? Well… yes? Hahaha!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon quickly averted her gaze and changed the topic.
 </p>
 <p>
  “More importantly, Boss! BattleNet management keeps contacting me. They want you to accept a commendation…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They’re still on about that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. They even offered a date of your choice. The new Director really wants to meet you… They were quite insistent. They even said they’d wait for you today, and apparently got scolded for sending that message!”
 </p>
 <p>
  If we put convenience aside for the date, there was time to utilize before entering the Gold League.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, he wondered if there was a need to go and receive a commendation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should discuss using the penthouse more during this opportunity,’ he thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  The most important thing right now is for Yoon Seah to safely spend time until she becomes a Gold Rank on October 25th.
 </p>
 <p>
  Being in the thoroughly guarded penthouse of Sword Palace was advantageous in many ways.
 </p>

 <p>
  Besides, it wasn’t bad to participate in such events to request security personnel from the government.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood. Please convey that I will attend the commendation ceremony. Any date works for me, so ask them to call me at their convenience.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, really?! Yes! I’ll convey it right away!”
 </p>
 <p>
  How tormented the new Management Director might have been was evident as color quickly returned to Lee Hayeon’s face.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan and Lee Hayeon were discussing guild-related matters, Lee Hayeon’s phone buzzed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, Sophia. Have you landed? You don’t know Boss’s phone number?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Wasn’t this pre-arranged?
 </p>
 <p>
  How can she not know the number?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can I give it to her?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Lee Hayeon moved away from her phone and whispered to Seong Jihan, he shrugged.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Since she’s already here, give it to her.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow. Easy decision. You didn’t give it to me like that before.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Back then, I genuinely couldn’t remember the number.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Still on about that…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon still didn’t believe Seong Jihan’s truth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Is it even conceivable for someone not to know their own phone number?
 </p>
 <p>
  Her reaction was very logical.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sophia, the number is…”
 </p>
 <p>
  After giving the number to Sophia, Lee Hayeon ended the call and looked at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where are you heading?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A restaurant in a nearby hotel.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, you’ve come to Korea! I should take you to a unique local restaurant!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, let’s go to the traditional restaurant in the adjacent hotel.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan had no intention of going far.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was a luxury hotel right next to Sword Palace, so they decided to go to its traditional restaurant.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I like it there too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is it good?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh? You’ve never been?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can’t recall.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Why is it that he’s a genius in BattleNet, but can’t remember the simplest things?’
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s really delicious. You should treat me sometime.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shouldn’t you treat me, Hayeon, given how much you’ve earned?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, okay. Thanks to you, I didn’t lose anything. I’ll treat you!”
 </p>
 <p>
  She didn’t lose anything.
 </p>
 <p>
  She didn’t bet against Seong Jihan, but thanks to him, she got the BattleNet rewards and wasn’t left penniless.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Never mind. How can I take from the poor? We’ll go for a guild dinner next time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Calling me poor? I’m Lee Seongga’s daughter, you know?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you keep betting, even if you’re the daughter of the Gates family, you’ll soon become poor.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait, you knew I bet against you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course, I knew. If you had won, you would’ve boasted about it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon looked away, scratching her cheek.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… I trusted you, but the system was such a big variable… From my expert perspective…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can hear Gayeong laughing behind you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What? Why!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I unintentionally laughed at the word ‘expert’. I apologize.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you, Mr. Seong Jihan. Thanks to you, I earned enough to retire.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lim Gayeong, who had been silent, sincerely bowed her head to Seong Jihan in gratitude.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You… when did you bet?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Miss, I realized too late. If I bet against whatever you’re betting on, it’s like printing money.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What…what?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But, having realized it late, I earned my retirement fund. Thank you, Miss. I will still work, though.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You… Oh my…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lim Gayoung’s opposing bet left Lee Hayeon speechless.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You both sort it out then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan gave them space to settle their disagreement.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not long after,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ring! Ring! Ring!
 </p>
 <p>
  A call from an unknown number came to the phone.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hello?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Jihan! I’m here!]
 </p>

 <p>
  It was a call from Sophia.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  At a traditional Korean restaurant in a Gangnam Hotel.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, you brought your niece? That’s great!”
 </p>
 <p>
  At first, Sophia warmly greeted Yoon Seah, but soon after,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah, how do I eat this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, you wrap it like this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, it’s delicious!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The two of them, being of the same age, naturally got along well and had a great time.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the meal was coming to an end, Sophia, with a beaming smile, spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jihan! Aren’t you curious about the story I told you last time?”
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a story about an Otherworldly Relic.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though he had heard it in detail from Sophia in his previous life, Seong Jihan pretended not to know and asked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course, I’m curious. But I didn’t expect you to come to Korea. Especially without notice.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehe, wasn’t our promise in the game enough of a notice?”ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia, sticking out her tongue, then spoke seriously.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is a secret. You know, right, Seah?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, the reason you didn’t use your stat points? What is it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s this thing called an Otherworldly Relics in BattleNet…”
 </p>
 <p>
  As if she was sharing the most crucial secret, Sophia lowered her voice to tell about the Otherworldly Relic.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan just pretended to listen because he already knew everything.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow, really? So, we can gain divine power with that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead, Yoon Seah was excitedly reacting on the side.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, noticing Seong Jihan’s lack of reaction, she asked,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why aren’t you surprised?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I already knew about the Otherworldly Relic.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh my, really? I thought so. I saw an old video of you holding a weird weapon. Was that the Otherworldly Relic?”
 </p>
 <p>
  When did she watch that?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you’re talking about the video from my Bronze League, yes, it was.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I knew it! My brother said he thought Jihan had the Otherworldly Relic.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “By brother, do you mean commentator Christopher?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, that’s right. He mentioned it while watching your video.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ESPN’s BattleNet commentator, Christopher.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although he mostly used vague expressions during broadcasts related to Seong Jihan, he was renowned in the industry as one of the top experts.
 </p>
 <p>
  “He said he’d analyze Jihan’s gameplay in-depth, even if he has to use his gift.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Gift? Was commentator Christopher a player?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, it’s a secret…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia, not sure if it’s just to Seong Jihan or if she’s always like this, easily spilled the beans.
 </p>
 <p>
  “My brother has a supporting gift.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What kind of supporting gift?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well… It’s ‘Exploration’.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She gestured a zipping motion across her mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You really shouldn’t tell anyone. I don’t know why, but he hates mentioning his supporting gift. I’m only telling you and Seah because I trust you. It’s a secret!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who else did you tell?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Um… Diana, Jane, Emma…”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Sophia continued counting on her fingers, Seong Jihan responded with disbelief.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ve told quite a few people. Is it really a secret?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They’re all trustworthy! It’ll be fine!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia seemed to have no concept of a secret.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan immediately asked,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anyway, ‘Exploration’… do you know its functions?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He didn’t tell me, just said I shouldn’t mention it to you. Although, he once got drunk and complained he only sees item names clearer with it and doesn’t know what else to use it for.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s the gift’s rank?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mine? SS!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, Christopher’s rank.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, I think it was B…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia tried her best to share what she knew, looking a bit awkward.
 </p>
 <p>
  Listening, Seong Jihan recalled a conversation he had with Ariel in the past.
 </p>
 <p>
  – I can’t understand it. This world should also have dungeon portals. Don’t you need a player with the ‘Exploration’ gift to eliminate them?
 </p>
 <p>
  Supporting gift ‘Exploration’.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seems useless now.
 </p>
 <p>
  But in reality, it was the key to eliminating dungeon portals.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he had known about Exploration’s capability back then, the world wouldn’t have collapsed so easily in his previous life.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘And Christopher had that important gift…?’
 </p>
 <p>
  He had unexpectedly obtained crucial information.
 </p>

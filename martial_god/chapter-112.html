  Chapter 112

  <strong>
   Chapter 112
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  As the meal was nearing its end and dessert was about to be served, Seong Jihan earnestly considered the Gift called ‘Exploration’.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I currently have no means to make Christopher mine.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With Lee Hayeon, who had a growth ability, there was a connection.
 </p>
 <p>
  By leveraging Zero’s characteristics to provide sure-win bets, she could be persuaded.
 </p>
 <p>
  But for Christopher, who is currently making a splash as a top commentator in the US, there was no carrot enticing enough.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That said, I don’t necessarily need to secure Christopher.’
 </p>
 <p>
  This was the conclusion Seong Jihan reached while contemplating on persuading Christopher.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Lee Hayeon’s growth was a necessary ability for the individual growth of Seong Jihan, Christopher’s Exploration was perhaps a gift needed on a ‘national’ scale to eradicate dungeons.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Of course, there are benefits in monopolizing the information and making him mine… but spreading this information widely is more valuable.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, Seong Jihan decided to release all the information about the Exploration at once.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he provided information to a foreign country without any compensation for it, there would be almost no backlash…
 </p>
 <p>
  Besides, he had recently gained significant income from various places, so he wasn’t lacking financially.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, there was a more critical reason.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was more important to end the dungeon phenomenon that pushed the world to the brink and elevate the player level globally.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘And to relay such information, Ariel would be needed.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A Shadow Elf like Ariel was perfect to explain that the Exploration had the ability to find dungeon cores.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I need to use the restroom.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Yoon Seah was about to leave her seat, Seong Jihan summoned Ariel.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Go with Ariel.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh… Why?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It might be dangerous.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come on, how can the restroom inside a restaurant be dangerous?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “True. Master, this is a bit much.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just go and come back. Ariel will tell you an interesting story.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What? Me? What story?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan forcibly sent a confused Ariel with her.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll be in full protective mode until October.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching this, Sophia, who was observing from the side, commented as if she was envious of Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah is really lucky.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “She’s drawing all of Jihan’s attention.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “She’s my niece.”Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have a niece at my older brother’s too. She’s cute, but not to that extent.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If she was your only remaining family, you’d think differently.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Preparing for the worst-case scenario often brings the best outcome.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Just in case.’
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s why Seong Jihan had to be even more meticulous.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s it! I want to receive that kind of attention from Jihan!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Given this, I do care quite a bit…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not enough, don’t you think?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite Seong Jihan’s explanation, Sophia seemed utterly unsatisfied.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jihan, what if I officially join the Daegi Guild?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s fine. You’re paying rent as part of AF.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why? Don’t you need supporters? I am quite capable, you know!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, Seong Jihan knew better than anyone that Sophia was an exceptional talent.
 </p>
 <p>
  Due to her simple yet powerful effect of tripling buff efficiency, she was considered the world’s best supporter in his past life.
 </p>
 <p>
  Any normal guild would have welcomed her with open arms.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re a nurturing guild, so we don’t really… have plans to expand the guild.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan seemed disinterested.
 </p>
 <p>
  The answer that he had no plans to expand the guild was a public reason, but in truth, the US wouldn’t let it happen.
 </p>
 <p>
  The US pays utmost attention to BattleNet players.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unless Seong Jihan’s Daegi Guild completely relocates to the US, they will never allow Sophia to go to Korea.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What were you guys talking about?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Just then, Yoon Seah returned to her seat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah… Jihan rejected my request to join the guild.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait, what? Uncle! Why did you reject Sophia?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s an adult situation.”
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  “I’m an adult too! My birthday has passed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Yoon Seah sat down with a sulky expression, Ariel, who followed her, spoke as if she was bored.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There was nothing unusual.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, Uncle. What could be strange here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master. So what’s this ‘interesting story’ you mentioned?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Facing the question from the very person who was supposed to tell the interesting story, Seong Jihan responded lightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s about the Exploration Gift.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Exploration? Why?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That… I plan to reveal it on BattleTube.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why would you go so far as to reveal that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel tilted his head in confusion, but Sophia, who had been listening to their conversation, exclaimed in surprise.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jihan! Don’t tell me you’re revealing that my brother has the Exploration Gift?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, of course, we must keep that secret.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, then…? Is there something special about the Exploration Gift?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the puzzled expression on Sophia’s face, Seong Jihan looked at her thoughtfully.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia’s appearance might attract more attention.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you curious? Want to film together for BattleTube?”
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  In a corner of the Daegi Guild office.
 </p>
 <p>
  With lighting and cameras set up, Seong Jihan began a live broadcast.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hello, everyone. Today, I’m planning to broadcast with a guest.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s channel had grown into a massive channel with over 3 million subscribers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks to his recent performance in the TOP 100 games, an unexpected surge of viewers flocked to his sudden broadcast.
 </p>
 <p>
  – So many viewers even for a surprise broadcastㅎㅎ;
 </p>
 <p>
  – Jihan’s channel has really grown. Is it still the old small channel? Lol
 </p>
 <p>
  – It’s only been a short time since he started, right? How can one grow this fast in just two months?
 </p>
 <p>
  – And his form is even more insane these days. He’s growing every day. But suddenly a guest?
 </p>
 <p>
  Responding to the viewers’ questions, Seong Jihan gestured to one side.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hello~!”
 </p>
 <p>
  – OMG, Sophia?
 </p>
 <p>
  – She really came, lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wow… An angel has descended ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
 </p>
 <p>
  – I heard Jihan’s channel often features beautiful women.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Right, Shizuru was the best.
 </p>
 <p>
  – We should exclude her. She used charm after all.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Then let’s exclude Shizuru and vote for the most popular later!
 </p>
 <p>
  “What vote? We’re not doing that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan quickly dismissed the viewers’ suggestions and had a light conversation with Sophia.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sophia, what brought you to Korea?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course, to see Jihan! And I loved Korean food!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m glad you liked it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But I couldn’t taste the dessert. It was rejected!”
 </p>
 <p>
  – Woah, he rejected Sophia…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Did he reject her confession on the same day? Lol. Why so fast?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Glad he rejected her lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you mean ‘rejected’?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You told me not to join the guild. That’s a rejection.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Won’t the viewers misunderstand if you say it that way?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, can I be straightforward and say I like you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia leaned closer to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  She seemed even bolder than before.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…No, it’s okay.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “See!”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan swiftly declined, Sophia looked at the camera as if she was wronged.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ugh… I never hated the BattleNet real-time translation system this much…
 </p>
 <p>
  – I’m so thirsty for the drama…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Did he turn on the broadcast to stir up drama?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Christopher. Are you watching?
 </p>
 <p>
  – I’m watching. Sophia is an adult, she can handle her life. I don’t know why she’s doing this on the broadcast though…
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  – Wait, is that the real Christopher??
 </p>
 <p>
  – Seems like it lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I keep talking to Sophia like this, I’ll lose my composure.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Before the broadcast could spiral further, Seong Jihan decided to steer the conversation back.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright, that’s not the main point. Today, we’re going to talk about… you know my summon, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan gestured, Ariel, who had been waiting, approached.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The tutorial’s restrictions have loosened a bit, so I heard you have an interesting story to share.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Was the Exploration gift such an interesting story?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If it can close the dungeons, it becomes interesting.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait, you mean Exploration can eliminate a dungeon?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia, who didn’t know about the true capability of the Exploration gift until the broadcast, was greatly surprised.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Exploration? Is there such a gift?
 </p>
 <p>
  – What does that have to do with dungeons?
 </p>
 <p>
  – How can a dungeon be closed? I thought once it appears, it’s over.
 </p>
 <p>
  The atmosphere was one of confusion among the viewers when Seong Jihan suddenly dropped this bombshell.
 </p>
 <p>
  To this, Ariel calmly provided an additional explanation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Players can locate the dungeon core inside the dungeon using a support gift called ‘Exploration’. Depending on the dungeon’s difficulty, the required grade for exploration differs… but yes. For a low-difficulty dungeon, if you have exploration of grade C or above, you can locate the dungeon core.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So if you do that, the dungeon really disappears?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. If the league ranking is low, it might reappear after some time, but there’s a gap.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really? With Exploration? The dungeon?”
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wow, dungeons could be eliminated? Even if you wiped out all the monsters inside, the portal didn’t disappear.
 </p>
 <p>
  – If we had this method, North Korea wouldn’t have collapsed…
 </p>
 <p>
  – So, is unification with the North possible now?
 </p>
 <p>
  – There are too many dungeon portals there, so it seems impossible.
 </p>
 <p>
  – This really needs to be verified, right? But have you ever seen someone with the Exploration gift?
 </p>
 <p>
  – I have a friend who received the exploration gift and became a private detective. I heard he’s grade C. I should tell him.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Ariel explained that dungeons could be located through exploration, the chat window quickly turned chaotic.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dungeon portals appear in the bottom 10% of countries.
 </p>
 <p>
  Many nations had collapsed due to this.
 </p>
 <p>
  North Korea, just above, was one such example, and several regions in Africa had become uninhabitable lands due to dungeon portals.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now it’s only the bottom 10%.
 </p>
 <p>
  What would happen to the world if this increased to 20%, or 30%?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Isn’t this groundbreaking information?
 </p>
 <p>
  – People with the Exploration gift hit the jackpot.
 </p>
 <p>
  – I feel like this information could be sold separately…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Why are you revealing this? You should sell it at a high price!
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not even information that’s been cross-verified. Since dungeons are a shared problem for humanity, I didn’t intend to ask for a fee for this information.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan added with a kind smile on his face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, I would appreciate it if the World BattleNet Association could verify this information. Do you have any other good info, Ariel?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel seemed to think for a moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How about this? ———.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Something was said, but only a beep was heard.
 </p>
 <p>
  At this, Seong Jihan said with a hint of disappointment,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh… It seems to have been censored again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, is that so? That’s too bad!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps because of Ariel’s impeccable voice filtering, everyone thought it was a system limitation, not realizing that the Shadow Elf was playing tricks.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s reveal only this much for now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no need to reveal too much knowledge.
 </p>
 <p>
  They would use the system as an excuse and control the information appropriately.
 </p>
 <p>
  Later, Seong Jihan had a brief conversation with Sophia before ending the broadcast.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, it’s over already?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not good to drag on for too long. Let’s go. You said you booked that hotel for accommodation, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Let’s meet again tomorrow!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have an award ceremony tomorrow, so it might be tough.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Darn…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, brushing off Sophia’s suggestion lightly, said to Yoon Seah,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah, let’s go together to drop her off.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay, uncle.”
 </p>
 <p>
  On their way back after dropping Sophia at a hotel next to Sword Palace,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, I didn’t mention it earlier because I wasn’t sure. But the woman I saw earlier in the restaurant bathroom…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel, who was back in Seong Jihan’s arm,
 </p>
 <p>
  [From a distance, she’s secretly tailing us.]
 </p>
 <p>
  informed him that they were being followed.

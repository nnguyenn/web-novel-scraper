  <strong>
   Chapter 113
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tailing?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was taken aback internally.
 </p>
 <p>
  Judging from Ariel’s words, it wasn’t him they were after, but Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was his fear coming to reality.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Could it be…?’
 </p>
 <p>
  He had been cautious upon discovering the terms from Yoon Seah’s Gift.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, even Seong Jihan hadn’t expected them to approach so quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘As far as I know, the only other owner of the ‘Late Bloomer’ is Xin Youhwa from China.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Could they have actually sent someone after her?
 </p>
 <p>
  [Should I eliminate them?]
 </p>
 <p>
  At Ariel’s indifferent suggestion, Seong Jihan shook his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it’s the person tailing them, then capturing them would only be catching a small fry.
 </p>
 <p>
  The crucial thing is finding out who ordered the stalking.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ariel, can you tail them in return?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [I can, but if they get too far, I can only hear them. Shadow stats are insufficient.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [We can’t help that. Please do it.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Understood. I’ll be back.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As Ariel vanished,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan calmly continued his conversation with Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle, should I attend the award ceremony tomorrow?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course. Stay within my Absolute Domain until you upgrade to Gold.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh… Won’t that be too clingy?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just endure for a month. After that, I’ll let you go without any reservations.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After saying this, the moment Seong Jihan stepped into the Sword Palace’s elevator, he lowered his voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah, we have a tail.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Eh? A tail?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ariel discovered it and is following.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Am I the target?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Probably. Ariel said it was someone she saw in the ladies’ restroom. Do you remember?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Scratching her cheek, Yoon Seah replied,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uhm, not really… Could it be a subscriber following out of fan affection?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What kind of fan of a Silver Rank?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey! You were a Silver Rank just a few days ago! I’m a BattleTuber with 50,000 subscribers in my own right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anyway, let’s be more cautious for now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it. Seriously, a tail?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, who initially didn’t believe Seong Jihan, quickly turned serious.
 </p>
 <p>
  She had just revealed her Gift’s conditions, and already someone was tailing her?
 </p>
 <p>
  She had thought Seong Jihan was being overly protective, but it seems his concerns were justified.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not much later,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The target is heavily guarded. She even keeps summons in the restroom, and Seong Jihan is living very close to her.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Understood. Do not act hastily. Continue monitoring.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Having returned to the penthouse, Ariel replayed the stalker’s voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Uh… It’s in Chinese?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. That’s the only clue. I couldn’t determine who’s the boss, but I’ve left a trace on the stalker’s shadow, so we can trace back anytime.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though that’s all Ariel reported,
 </p>
 <p>
  From the moment Chinese was spoken, Seong Jihan had a strong hunch about who might be behind this.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It must be Xin Youhwa.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Xin Youhwa, the world-ranked second from his past life and the owner of China’s ‘Late Bloomer’ Gift, was targeting Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If they’re making moves like this, I feel like proactively taking them out.’
 </p>
 <p>
  From Seong Jihan’s perspective, he felt no reluctance in killing people since he had passed through many hardships in his previous life.
 </p>
 <p>
  But there was a problem…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to find out where Xin Youhwa is.’
 </p>
 <p>
  China is vast.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, unlike in his previous life, Xin Youhwa was not a famous player this time, so it was difficult to find out her whereabouts.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I guess I have to keep watching Seah until she becomes a Gold Rank.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s brows furrowed.
 </p>
 <p>
  He would have loved to take action immediately, but finding a single person in China was almost impossible.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It would be great if Xin Youhwa suddenly appeared before me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  But the opponent wasn’t a fool, so that was unlikely.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan naturally thought so.
 </p>
 <p>

 <p>
  “They were already prepared?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, Miss.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why not just shoot them? There should be an opening.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The opponent has a summon. It seems they didn’t act recklessly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Xin Youhwa frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No, they should’ve tried harder. What’s the big deal if there’s a summon? Just shoot, right?’
 </p>
 <p>
  How strong could a Shadow Elf be to block bullets that come in dozens or hundreds?
 </p>
 <p>
  They could have just charged and killed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They don’t think it’s their responsibility, do they?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Triad was a powerful criminal organization in the past.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now they are into legitimate businesses, and the violence of the organization has significantly reduced compared to the old days.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, they were still powerful against the weak, but it was a different story when dealing with strong opponents like Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  They didn’t want to take risks.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This won’t work.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The day Xin Youhwa decided to harm Yoon Seah was tomorrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  While she was planning to eliminate Yoon Seah with the help of her father, a high-ranking member of the Triad, she heard that Seong Jihan received a commendation from the Korean BattleNet Management Bureau and chose that day to act.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the people her father trusted were currently dispatched to Seoul,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can’t just leave it to them. It might be the last chance…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing that Seong Jihan was prepared, Xin Youhwa grew anxious.
 </p>
 <p>
  If she missed tomorrow’s opportunity, she felt there might not be another.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Late Bloomer… This Gift was originally mine!’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Gift ‘Late Bloomer’.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first to receive it was Xin Youhwa herself.
 </p>
 <p>
  When she awakened three years ago, she got this gift which seemed utterly useless, driving her to despair.
 </p>
 <p>
  But when Yoon Seah revealed her same gift recently, she realized its true value.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Ever since then, I struggled hard and made it to Silver rank…!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks to the “Late Bloomer” Gift’s ability to play the game twice a day, Xin Youhwa could reach Silver in a month.
 </p>
 <p>
  She even reached grade E, thinking she would have a smooth journey ahead.
 </p>
 <p>
  But what awaited her was a challenging condition to upgrade to D-rank.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Conditions for Upgrade to D rank]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Be the sole owner of the Late Bloomer Gift on the planet. (Currently 2)]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Among the Late Bloomer Gift holders, be the first to reach the Gold Player rank.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Xin Youhwa’s gift didn’t explain everything like Yoon Seah’s, but it showed the conditions to upgrade to D-rank.
 </p>
 <p>
  At first, she thought of trying hard to reach Gold first, but
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘How dare she get carried…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, who was getting carried by Seong Jihan, could not be caught up with.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, there was only one remaining method.
 </p>
 <p>
  She must be the sole person possessing the Gift.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This won’t do. I have to go check it out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, miss? You’re going to Korea?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Book a flight for me now! If I leave by this dawn, I can arrive before the commendation ceremony!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But there’s no need for you to go…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  “If they had just taken the shot in the restroom, then I wouldn’t have to go, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Xin Youhwa spoke with a grim face, the man who had been reporting next to her broke out in cold sweat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Back then, there was a summon…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you consider all that when deciding how to kill? If she was away from Seong Jihan, you should shoot no matter what!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I… I’ll relay it as such.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s settled. Since I’m going, prepare a gun for me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Miss! It’s too dangerous for you to go yourself!”
 </p>
 <p>
  To that, Xin Youhwa gave a sardonic laugh.
 </p>
 <p>
  I might be finished if not tomorrow. What’s the big deal about the danger?
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have to take on that much risk to complete the Gift.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What if you’re exposed before you even act!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Will I be exposed? How many people know I have a Gift.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Only a handful in the Celestial Guild created by the Triad knew about Xin Youhwa’s Gift.
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s no way a foreigner would know.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You guys should be prepared for the aftermath.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She spoke with confidence.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  The next day.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because of Seong Jihan’s brief broadcast, the world was once again in an uproar.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Can the dungeon portal be eliminated? Seong Jihan’s sudden bombshell statement!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [People with Exploration Gift are getting scouted even by the top 10 guilds. It’s like hitting the jackpot!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [World BattleNet Association announces they will test if the Gift ‘Exploration’ truly has an effect.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [What is the identity of Seong Jihan’s summon, Shadow Elf?]

 <p>
  “Wow… articles about uncle are pouring out every day.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the limousine sent by the BattleNet Management Office,
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, who had been admiring the articles flooding in, exclaimed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Given it’s about the dungeon, it’s worth the fuss.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dungeon portal.
 </p>
 <p>
  Isn’t this the very reason why every country in the world is desperately trying to maintain their league rankings?
 </p>
 <p>
  He revealed a way to close it on the broadcast, it would have been strange if there wasn’t an uproar.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Thanks to Mr. Seong Jihan, I can quit my detective job…ㅠㅠ No need to follow infidelity scenes anymore.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Were you scouted? ㄷㄷㄷ
 </p>
 <p>
  – Even though I’m C-class, I received a full-time position offer from the Divergent Guild. I’m amazed at how they knew and contacted me within just a day.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wow, if you’re C-rank, you can go elsewhere! Try sending a resume to American First
 </p>
 <p>
  – I can’t speak English…
 </p>
 <p>
  – ㅋㅋㅋㅋ This person is underestimating AF. Just send them a photo of your C-rank Gift.
 </p>
 <p>
  As posts from those with the supporting Gift ‘Exploration’ receiving scouting offers were pouring in,
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah scrolled through the articles on her smartphone.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But Sophia’s confession is overshadowed. Ah… it’s a bit in the entertainment news.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why are you even searching that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sophia seemed serious. She asked me what type you like, uncle.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Tell her to become the world’s number one supporter. Then I might like her.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Tap! Tap! Tap!
 </p>
 <p>
  Hearing Seong Jihan’s words, Yoon Seah, with an incredulous expression, quickly tapped on her phone.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright. I sent it as is.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You sent that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh… Uncle. She says she’ll do it. But in return, you need to stay single until then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Is this some kind of trick?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan chuckled and nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was going to stay single anyway.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I have so much to do right now, where would I find time for romance?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Be careful today. I’ll give you Ariel, but if something feels off, make sure to use the Veil of the Void.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If it weren’t for the tailing incident yesterday, she would’ve thought his worry was unfounded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah seemed to have realized the seriousness, practicing taking out the Veil of the Void from her inventory.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  BattleNet Administration Office, not far from Sword Palace.
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as Seong Jihan stepped out of the limousine, he was greeted warmly by the staff.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, Mr. Seong Jihan! You’re here early!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially excited to see him was a middle-aged man standing at the front of the staff.
 </p>
 <p>
  The pleasantly looking, plump man bowed repeatedly to greet Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who might you be?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah! It’s our first time meeting! Nice to meet you. I’m Oh Gyuseung, the new Director of BattleNet Management!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re the director? You really didn’t have to do all this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh no, we must when we have such an esteemed guest! Let me personally escort you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps because he replaced the previous director after a scandal, Oh Gyuseung was overly deferential, guiding Seong Jihan to the event hall.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s quite a crowd.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re receiving a commendation, Mr. Seong Jihan. Many distinguished guests have come to honor the occasion.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… I see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Originally, the president wanted to personally present the commendation, but due to an overseas trip, the prime minister will be attending in their stead. The prime minister will personally present the commendation at this ceremony.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The BattleNet Administration’s Award for Excellence. It’s not just given to anyone, but it’s not something so grand that the president or prime minister would normally attend.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Why is there such a fuss with all these people?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah looked uncomfortable, shaking her head in disbelief.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, however, seemed used to this treatment and nodded calmly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s get this over with quickly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Haha! Understood. I’ll make sure the ceremony is wrapped up quickly!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As they walked deeper into the event hall, Seong Jihan suddenly stopped and looked at a particular spot.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Director?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, what is it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who are those people over there?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Where Seong Jihan was looking was none other than the VIP table.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They’re distinguished guests from the Chinese embassy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “From China?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes… they really wanted to attend. I hope there’s no issue.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Director seemed anxious, watching Seong Jihan’s reaction.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, not at all. They came to celebrate, how thoughtful.”ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan smiled deeply.
 </p>
 <p>
  His gaze was fixed on one of the guests from the Chinese embassy, a young-looking woman drinking tea, Xin Youhwa.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Strike of luck.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Really.
 </p>
 <p>
  He didn’t expect her to come seeking her own doom.

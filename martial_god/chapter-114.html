  Chapter 114
 </p>
 <p>
  It was unexpected for Seong Jihan that Xin Youhwa would be here.
 </p>
 <p>
  She could have just sent someone from across the sea, but she risked coming here himself?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No, she must’ve thought it wasn’t dangerous.’
 </p>
 <p>
  She probably hadn’t considered him a returnee, so from Xin Youhwa’s perspective, she would have judged that Seong Jihan didn’t know his identity.
 </p>
 <p>
  For Seong Jihan, it was like the icing on the cake.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, the woman who was tailing us last time is also over there.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel, who had planted a shadow on the follower, continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan spread his Force senses widely and examined the people sitting at the table.
 </p>
 <p>
  He sensed firearms on them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps because they were a delegation from the Chinese embassy, they entered with firearms without raising any suspicions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking at the size and shape, they were special handguns designed to be used against awakeners.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They’re blatantly planning to shoot.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With their intentions clear, Seong Jihan wanted to deal with them immediately.
 </p>
 <p>
  But he couldn’t just yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  What if Xin Youhwa dies as soon as Seong Jihan enters the venue?
 </p>
 <p>
  With this timing, and since many people knew he had the Force, it could raise unnecessary suspicions.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll need to make it look like a sudden death.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan gave instructions to Ariel on his left arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ariel, can you send some of your power to that woman’s shadow?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Just the young woman?]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Yes.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [Easy. Do I kill her?]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Not now. Can you make it look like a natural death later?’
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s also easy. She’s just a low-rank species, just stop her heart.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Good, it’s important not to leave any trace.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s my specialty.]
 </p>
 <p>
  From Seong Jihan’s arm, a part of Ariel’s power was released.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nobody noticed because he prioritized stealth.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Done. Command me whenever. As long as she’s not too far away, I can execute it immediately.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If you’re going to disguise it as a heart attack, execute when she’s away from her seat. People might save her if she collapses here.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [Should I make her go to the restroom then?]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Can you do that?’
 </p>
 <p>
  [Analyzing a low-rank species’ body is already completed. Just make her feel the urge.]
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s times like this that she truly feels like a superior species.
 </p>
 <p>
  Impressed by Ariel’s skill, Seong Jihan nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the plan set, he casually continued his conversation with the Management Director.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How will today’s event proceed?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, well, about that…”
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile,
 </p>
 <p>
  From a distance, Xin Youhwa, watching Seong Jihan’s group, frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s not as easy to create chaos in this venue structure as I thought.’
 </p>
 <p>
  While in Hong Kong, she wanted to act impulsively, but on arrival, there were many constraints.
 </p>
 <p>
  The BattleNet Administration’s venue in Korea was unexpectedly narrow; she couldn’t move easily in and out.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They should’ve killed her in the restroom then. Tsk.’
 </p>
 <p>
  She deeply regretted yesterday’s failure.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Youhwa, I heard a bit from your father.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At that time, Wang Lim, the Chinese ambassador to Korea who was at the same table, struck up a friendly conversation with Jin Yuhwa.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can you not separate Seong Jihan from that woman?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh my… Ambassador. Would that be possible for you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have some connections with this country’s Prime Minister. I already told him I wanted to speak with Seong Jihan. I’ll be in another reception room, and at that time, do as you please.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Xin Youhwa’s eyes sparkled.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ambassador Wang Lim, who her father had supported for a long time, must have been given a lot of money, as he was doing a lot to favor her situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood. Sir, thank you so much!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, also, send my regards to your father.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The two exchanged warm smiles.
 </p>

 <p>
  With the atmosphere becoming pleasant and some time passing by,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now, let’s begin the award ceremony!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The award ceremony was about to begin.
 </p>
 <p>
  The South Korean Prime Minister took the podium.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment, when Seong Jihan was waiting to receive a commendation,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why am I feeling like this? Did I get nervous even though I didn’t drink anything?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Xin Youhwa suddenly felt the need to go to the bathroom.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t have any immediate business right now; I should go and come back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She slowly rose from her seat and left the venue.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  In the women’s restroom prepared next to the event hall,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh… Ugh…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Xin Youhwa clutched her chest inside the restroom and collapsed.
 </p>
 <p>
  If she had been in the event hall, people would have called an ambulance, performed CPR on her, and taken various measures.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, since the event had just begun, no one was in the restroom to help her.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel confirmed that she had stopped breathing entirely and thought from within the shadows,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Truly a weak species.’ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels
 </p>
 <p>
  Hidden in the shadows, until taking control of her heart, this woman had not noticed at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  A species with dull senses, that stops breathing as soon as its heart stops.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was incomprehensible why such a species had been invited to the BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Giving out S-rank Gifts so liberally isn’t weird at all.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the Earthlings, most top players had gifts of S-rank or higher. Compared to the gifts the Shadow Elves received in the Battle Net, it was a very generous treatment.
 </p>
 <p>
  At first, she wondered why there was such discrimination, but now her opinion changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering the limits of the human race, shouldn’t they be given not just S-rank, but SS-rank or higher in the Battle Net?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Master is the strange one.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps it was because of his association with the ‘Wandering Martial God’ who hunts Constellations.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among humans, only Seong Jihan was exceptional.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he continues to grow like this, he would become a significant force in the Space League.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But why did he tell me to kill only this human?’
 </p>
 <p>
  She seemed insignificant.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel left Xin Youhwa and returned to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  On the stage of the event hall, as he was receiving the commendation,
 </p>
 <p>
  “We hope you continue to work hard for our country, Player Seong Jihan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you, Prime Minister.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He shook hands with the Prime Minister, receiving flashes from photographers.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Finished.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You did well.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Without any visible movement, Seong Jihan responded to Ariel.
 </p>
 <p>
  [But why only her? She seemed insignificant.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [She had the Gift ‘Late Bloomer’. She probably was the brain behind those with guns.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ah, was she the one tailing Yoon Seah?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. Fortunately, she came to die.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You figured that all out?.]
 </p>
 <p>
  In any case, while the human race is nothing special, this human stands out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel didn’t ask any more questions.
 </p>
 <p>
  He probably wouldn’t answer anyway.
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to witnessing the Ascension of Black Shadow, this was a minor doubt.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Player Seong Jihan, do you have a moment?”
 </p>
 <p>
  After the commendation ceremony, the Prime Minister, with a friendly smile, approached Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, Prime Minister.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Chinese ambassador has expressed his desire to speak with you… How about we meet him together?”
 </p>
 <p>
  While using honorifics for the Chinese ambassador, the Prime Minister pleaded to go together.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, I’ll go with my niece.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon hearing this, the Prime Minister looked around and whispered into Seong Jihan’s ear.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, actually, there might be some sensitive topics with him… Can your niece wait outside for a bit? It won’t take long.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He planned to separate us.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the Prime Minister skeptically.
 </p>
 <p>
  He didn’t know what relation the Prime Minister had with China to go this far, but it was better this way.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since Xin Youhwa had already been removed, staying with him would provide a solid alibi.

 <p>
  [Ariel, stay with Seah.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Understood.]
 </p>
 <p>
  After summoning Ariel to accompany Yoon Seah, Seong Jihan followed the Prime Minister to the reception room.
 </p>
 <p>
  There, the same people from the Chinese embassy were waiting for him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nice to meet you, Mr. Seong Jihan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Wang Lim, the Chinese ambassador to South Korea, greeted Seong Jihan in fluent Korean and offered a handshake.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve been impressed with your recent activities.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Starting the conversation with such praise, Wang Lim’s words were different from what the Prime Minister had previously discussed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It must be great to have such an outstanding player. Haha. It seems that Korea is ahead of us when it comes to promising talents.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you talking about? Only one player, Seong Jihan, stands out. How can the rest compare to China?”
 </p>
 <p>
  They were avoiding sensitive topics, just exchanging pleasantries.
 </p>
 <p>
  More precisely, the Prime Minister was exaggerating in response to Wang Lim’s flattery.
 </p>
 <p>
  If there was any sensitive discussion,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I saw the video from yesterday, Seong Jihan. Information related to the dungeon core… I never imagined you’d release that on BattleTube. Don’t you regret it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It wasn’t even certain information, and the dungeon portal is a problem faced by humanity. I thought it was right to release the information.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I see. A brilliant thought. But… don’t you think the returns to you are too little compared to the value of the information?”
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, Wang Lim handed him his business card.
 </p>
 <p>
  “After watching the video, I felt regret. If you have such information next time, how about closely cooperating with us? China pays a suitable price.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course, of course.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Paying a suitable price?
 </p>
 <p>
  Even now, working behind the scenes and talking like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you for the offer. I’ll think about it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan took the business card and stood up.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was there as an alibi, but he didn’t want to see the Prime Minister flattering the Chinese ambassador any longer.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll take my leave now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why not stay a little longer?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, I’ve been here too long, and my niece is waiting. I’ve received your card, so I’ll be on my way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We just started to make acquaintance, though…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Wang Lim tried to buy more time, but suddenly,
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  The door to the reception room burst open.
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s a disaster! Miss Xin Youhwa…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Huh? What happened?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [She’s been found dead in the restroom!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [What!?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The two shouting in Chinese.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who didn’t understand Chinese, looked blankly at the two with a grave atmosphere.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, no, how could this…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Prime Minister seemed to understand and looked serious.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are they saying”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, they said someone was found dead.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who the hell…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan asked seriously and quickly prepared to leave.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This isn’t the time… I need to go to my niece.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh… yes, please do!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Wang Lim, who had been trying to keep Seong Jihan back, didn’t stop him anymore due to the sudden news about Xin Youhwa.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh my! Mr. Seong Jihan, you’re here! There’s a huge problem now!”
 </p>
 <p>
  When he left the reception room, the Director approached him, making a fuss.
 </p>
 <p>
  Beside him were Yoon Seah and Ariel.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, I heard someone was found dead.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, yes. A woman from China was found deceased in the ladies’ restroom. It looks like a heart attack… I don’t understand what’s happening on such a good day.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, the director whispered,
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ve prepared a limousine for your return. It might be best to leave before it gets more chaotic.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you for your consideration. Let’s go, Seah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah nodded slowly at Seong Jihan’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Yes, uncle.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, who had been silent on the way home, finally spoke when the car arrived at Sword Palace.
 </p>
 <p>
  “My Gift, its rank has increased.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, from E to D.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She then looked up at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Did you do this, uncle?”
 </p>

  Chapter 116

 <p>
  Chapter 116
 </p>
 <p>
  Lone Bridge.
 </p>
 <p>
  This defense map, colloquially known as “Chibi”, was always a hindrance to Seong Jihan’s repeated attempts.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t because Seong Jihan lacked ability.
 </p>
 <p>
  The structure of the map itself was inherently challenging.
 </p>
 <p>
  After dealing with the wave, the enemy giant tribe leader, Hojo, would inevitably appear.
 </p>
 <p>
  His gust of wind would mercilessly slash all players other than Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  When more than half of the players were killed, a forced event would trigger.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You… will live.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The bridge guardian then hurled Seong Jihan away and self-destructed, destroying the bridge.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, despite Seong Jihan’s best efforts, the bridge map remained uncleared.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  After Seong Jihan advanced to Gold, he had a bit of leeway.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘My stats have grown tremendously.’
 </p>
 <p>
  At level 50, his Martial Power and Force stats were at 68.
 </p>
 <p>
  After going through the Gold promotion match, he invested all the level-up points he earned.
 </p>
 <p>
  Coupled with the all-stats +5 reward from BattleNet and the guild effects of Phoenix Flag, his stats had grown to 93.
 </p>
 <p>
  Only 7 points left to reach his mid-term goal of 100 for the unification of the three Dantians.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Still, using the final advanced technique is too much.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The third advanced technique of the Nameless Divine Arts, surpassing the Divine Thunder Decree and Dark Shadow Technique, was the ultimate move. Even the vastly improved Gold-level Seong Jihan couldn’t handle it recklessly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll have some leeway after the unification of the three Dantians.’
 </p>
 <p>
  While recalling the ultimate move, Seong Jihan greeted Sophia, who approached with a smile, and Yoon Seah, who was nervously nodding.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jihan! Thanks for including me in the party!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle, Sophia… turns out she’s older.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm, Sophia is older?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We talked about birthdays earlier. The way Americans calculate age is different from us.”
 </p>
 <p>
  No wonder.
 </p>
 <p>
  He remembered from his past life that Sophia and Seong Jihan’s sister had competed for an Otherworldly Relic.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed odd now that Sophia was said to be the same age as Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come on, why are you fussing over a year or two difference?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “People in our country are sensitive about age.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Forget it. We’ll be family soon, so don’t worry about it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Family?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If I become the top supporter, Me and Jihan will become family!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia said this with a bright smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  At those words, Yoon Seah looked stunned.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was just an offhand comment that it would be nice if Sophia became the top supporter.
 </p>
 <p>
  How far had she let her imagination run?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, a rare sight, responded with a heavy sweat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Let’s talk after you actually reach the top.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait for it. I’ll be there soon. That’s why I joined the Jihan Carry Party, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  A flame burned brightly in Sophia’s eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s Carry Party.
 </p>
 <p>
  This party, composed of Seong Jihan, Yoon Seah, and Sophia, promised rapid growth up to Gold.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I wanted to include Masied too, but he declined.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Diego Masied, who recently advanced to Silver, politely declined Seong Jihan’s party invitation, wanting to carve his own path.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Jihan. Thanks for the carry, but I think I won’t improve if I join your party. I want to grow on my own.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A fitting response from a former sports star.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan opened his inventory.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should try using the Phoenix Flag now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Upgraded from Phoenix’s Arrow to SSS grade item, the Phoenix Flag.
 </p>
 <p>
  At first glance, it looked very similar to the white arrow of Phoenix’s Arrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, it was bigger than the Phoenix’s Arrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the end of the flag was a white flame gathered, forming the shape of a flag.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whirr!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Phoenix Flag, holding several times more intense heat than the previous Phoenix’s Arrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though a flag was attached at the end, it seemed much stronger just to wield it compared to the old Phoenix’s Arrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially since the condition of limited uses was removed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Still, if there’s a downside, it’s the attack power.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The performance of the Phoenix Flag itself was rated SSS grade.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the reason it could be judged as SSS grade was thanks to the various additional effects that the Phoenix Flag possessed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I remember hearing that there’s a special effect when the flag is planted.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan planted the Phoenix Flag into the ground, a system message appeared before his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Would you like to unfurl the flag of the Phoenix at this spot?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Unfurl it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whooosh-!
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  With that, the Phoenix Flag burned up from the edges and disappeared completely.
 </p>
 <p>
  From within, the engraved Phoenix emerged and began to soar into the sky on its own.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The protection of the Phoenix descends on the battlefield.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [All stats of nearby party members and allies increase by 25%. This effect applies as far as the Phoenix can be seen.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The radiant figure of the Phoenix, emitting light and blazing brilliantly in the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  Its burning form was so immense that it could be seen from a considerable distance.
 </p>
 <p>
  A 25% buff applied as far as that can be seen.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That’s a substantial range.’
 </p>
 <p>
  On top of that, the stats increase effect also included the caster, Seong Jihan himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  Feeling even lighter, he looked satisfied and picked up the Phoenix Flag.
 </p>
 <p>
  He could use the Phoenix Flag, which had burned and vanished, as a spear again, just like before.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘An SSS grade weapon that casts a wide-area buff… I’m glad I listened to that crazy Constellation.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Constellation of the Dead Star, was it called Karlein?
 </p>
 <p>
  Simply for listening to his nonsensical ramblings, to gain such an item.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he had the same opportunity again, he would gladly listen.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Whoa, Uncle, what is this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The protection of the Phoenix? The buff effect is huge, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Including Seong Jihan’s two party members.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Whoa, what’s this buff?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re giving buffs now… Whoa, these numbers?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are we getting carried too?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Players of the defense game were also greatly surprised by the effect of the Phoenix’s protection.
 </p>
 <p>
  A player who breaks the game on his own now even grants buffs.
 </p>
 <p>
  Typical BattleNet!
 </p>
 <p>
  A game with absolutely no balance.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If it’s the Phoenix’s protection kind of buff, it’ll stack with my buff.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, let’s try it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, Sophia, who grants various buffs, applied hers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Receiving her buff, which had tripled in effect, Seong Jihan felt his already enhanced body get even stronger.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘With this, can we make it to Wave 2?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Wave 2, which they couldn’t progress further because they couldn’t stop the strong wind.
 </p>
 <p>
  But this time, it seemed possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ariel, act as a summoned creature this time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems I’m used more as a summon than a sword.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Because in this map, where they had to deal with the undead, the shadow sword was of dubious utility.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan summoned Ariel as a humanoid figure and placed her at the end of the bridge.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sophia, give buffs to others as well. Let’s try to get to the second stage this time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course. Giving buffs is what I do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He also asked Sophia to give buffs to other players.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “So noisy!!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  The massive bridge vibrated, and a roar that shook the heavens and earth was heard.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the same time,
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom! Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  Signaling the start of the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  The imperial gatekeeper, Bijang, approached the players.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  “While the gatekeeper fights alone at the front, those so-called soldiers chit-chat in the back!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The imperial gatekeeper, the giant Bijang.
 </p>
 <p>
  Reprimanding the summoned player-soldiers had now become a routine act.
 </p>
 <p>
  – He’s gonna kick them out with a stomp now
 </p>
 <p>
  – Will Jihan resist like last time?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Probably, he’s much stronger now. Seems like they could get to Wave 2.
 </p>
 <p>
  – No way, even if Seong Jihan does well, if the players at the back get wiped out, it’s over anyway. LOL.
 </p>
 <p>
  – But the buff seems good, so it won’t end as quickly as last time…
 </p>
 <p>
  The gameplay for this bridge map had been standardized to an extent, so viewers already had an idea of how the game would unfold.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Bijang, exasperated by such weaklings, decides to stomp.
 </p>
 <p>
  Excluding Seong Jihan, all the other players will probably be driven out of the bridge.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But you… What is that phoenix?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The giant named Bijang, who stands almost 4 meters tall, unusually compared to his regular behavior, asked Seong Jihan with caution.
 </p>
 <p>
  “With that level of divine power, only the Imperial Guard Captain might possess it… Were you newly selected as Jo Woong’s successor?”
 </p>
 <p>
  – ???????
 </p>
 <p>
  – Why is Bijang acting like that?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Right? It feels so out of character.
 </p>
 <p>
  – But what’s with Jo Woong? Is it a parody of Zhuo Yun from Romance of the Three Kingdoms?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Seems like it, LOL. If you reverse ‘Bijang’, it becomes ‘Jangbi’.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  – “Oh, was that it? Oh, then Hojo would be Heojeo.”
 </p>
 <p>
  – I haven’t watched Three Kingdoms, so I have no idea what you’re talking about.
 </p>
 <p>
  – It’s okay, LOL. The relationships are weird in this game anyway.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘How unusual.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was surprising for Seong Jihan that Bijang, who usually disliked him because of his appearance, was acting this way.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, he didn’t show any reaction.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Maybe I should try a different approach this time.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He decided to twist the game pattern.
 </p>
 <p>
  Regardless of how Wave 2 went, with their current strength, they would have been wiped out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Epic Quest]nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
 </p>
 <p>
  [Earn the recognition of the Imperial Gatekeeper and prevent his death.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Due to his appearance, Bijang is highly critical of Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead of gaining recognition in the traditional way, Seong Jihan decided to try a new approach.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I do belong to the Imperial family. However, I cannot reveal specifics. I hope you understand.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm…! I am the sworn brother of His Majesty the Emperor. And you say you can’t tell even me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Wrinkles formed on Bijang’s face, and he began to pout.
 </p>
 <p>
  His eyes moistened, and it was evident he was deeply hurt by Seong Jihan’s response.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed as if all the emotions he had bottled up regarding the Imperial family exploded.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Why is he suddenly so whiny?
 </p>
 <p>
  – They say you cry more as you get older… Baby-like!
 </p>
 <p>
  – He looks so pitiful.
 </p>
 <p>
  – His nearly bald head makes him look even sadder.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan felt more pity seeing Bijang, who usually wasn’t like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, you need information to share information.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Um… I’m sorry.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s response,
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang! Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  Bijang angrily pounded his chest.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How could you! Can’t you even give that much of an answer? I’m Bijang! The imperial gatekeeper!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I cannot go against the Imperial family’s laws. Please understand.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan firmly responded, Bijang showed his displeasure.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud! Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  He walked past Seong Jihan, signaling all the players to move out.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You ragtag bunch. Everyone, step back!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  He forcefully drove the remaining players out of the bridge.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then he himself,
 </p>
 <p>
  Step! Step!
 </p>
 <p>
  Went to the end of the bridge, sat down with his arms crossed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now, then, let’s see how the esteemed guest from the Imperial family handles this!”
 </p>
 <p>
  – He’s upset.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Totally.
 </p>
 <p>
  – He was trying to match the rhythm but now he’s left to fight alone alone, LOL.
 </p>
 <p>
  – It’s okay; he fought alone before.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Didn’t Bijang help with the Heavenly Net Thunder last time? There’s a difference with and without that.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Not a big difference. If it’s Seong Jihan, he can handle it, okay?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Oh, alright~
 </p>
 <p>
  As the viewers mentioned, in the previous game, Seong Jihan benefited greatly from Bijang’s Heavenly Net Thunder Formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  It amplified the power of lightning, granting a significant advantage against the undead.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, this time, with Bijang standing idly, that synergy effect was completely absent.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, it’s just Wave 1.’
 </p>
 <p>
  But Seong Jihan was much stronger than before.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan took his Phoenix Flag, which had disappeared, and walked to the center of the bridge.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ahem, Ahem…! Even if you die out of stubbornness, I won’t help!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bijang tried to intimidate him from behind, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Suit yourself.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With the undead army before him, Seong Jihan responded leisurely.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *

 <p>
  [Notes:
 </p>
 <p>
  TL/N: Some details on characters in Romance of the Three Kingdoms:
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  Zhao Yun, one of the main generals of the Shu Han state in “Romance of the Three Kingdoms.”
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  The name ‘Jangbi’ is a Korean pronunciation of ‘Zhang Fei’, a military general of Shu Han in the Three Kingdoms era of China.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  Heojeo is not a character I know but the conversation appears to be playfully suggesting that certain names sound like they might be parodied or twisted versions of characters from “Romance of the Three Kingdoms” so it might just be an attempt to see if Hojo is parody on a character anyone knows or remembers without directly referencing any genuine character from the classic novel.]

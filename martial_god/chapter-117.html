  Chapter 117
 </p>
 <p>
  Defense Map, ‘Lone Bridge’ First Wave.
 </p>
 <p>
  The main force of monsters crossing the bridge consisted of Death Knights, just like before.
 </p>
 <p>
  These Death Knights were such formidable monsters among the undead that they could even give the Diamond-ranked players a run for their money, let alone the Platinum ones.
 </p>
 <p>
  But now, every time Seong Jihan’s Phoenix Flag made a move, they were swept away like fallen leaves in the wind.
 </p>
 <p>
  – I told you, right? When Jihan swings, they’re all swept away.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ah… I hate being unable to refute this situation…ㅜㅜ
 </p>
 <p>
  – Who cares about the Death Knight or any strategy? He’s just sweeping them all away. Seriously, no analysis needed for this player.
 </p>
 <p>
  Without the Heavenly Net Thunder Formation, he might not be able to single-handedly overpower them like last time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anyone who had some experience in BattleNet could have analyzed this.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, what was the current situation?
 </p>
 <p>
  Nameless Divine Art, Triad of Martial Mastery: Total Annihilation.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a swift motion, as the Phoenix Flag slashes horizontally, the horde of Death Knights in front are engulfed in flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was an entirely different level of power than what was shown with the Thunder Formation buff.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having leveled up to the Gold league, his stats had seen an incredible boost compared to when he was in Silver.
 </p>
 <p>
  Additionally, his attack style had also evolved from his time in Silver.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The power of the Thunder Seal is quite potent.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The stat, Thunder Seal, that he gained from the promotion match.
 </p>
 <p>
  This power, which enhances the strength of lightning, wasn’t just applied when using the Divine Thunder Decree, but also when simply swinging a weapon.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the addition of extremely effective lightning against the undead, even the formidable Death Knights couldn’t withstand a single blow from Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is easy.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He effortlessly cuts down the ground monsters and when he has the time, he even eliminates the airborne ghost troops.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although he’s focused mainly on the ground, he can’t cover everything in the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  From the back, the vigilant Bijang, who was watching with his arms crossed, took care of the ghosts coming from the other side of the cliff.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hm…! He may not be as good as Jo Woong, but he does have some skills!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bijang grumbled with a dissatisfied face.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had hoped that Jihan would struggle and plead for help.
 </p>
 <p>
  But Jihan was too good in combat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this why he’s recognized by the Imperial family as the master of the divine beast…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Murmuring to himself, Bijang looked across the bridge.
 </p>
 <p>
  The horde of Death Knights were nearly annihilated by Seong Jihan, signaling the end of the first wave of the invasion.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  From afar, there was the sound of galloping.
 </p>
 <p>
  Cavalry in black armor was lined up, with banners fluttering in the wind, depicting a black bird with its wings spread out.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Black Spear Cavalry approached the bridge with an intimidating aura.
 </p>
 <p>
  They marked the beginning of the second wave: the march of the Black Spear Cavalry of the Phoenix Corps.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems Hojo has arrived… You! Step back!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bijang rose to his feet.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how powerful a guest from the Imperial family might be, they can’t be expected to face off against Hojo, the leader of the Phoenix Corps.
 </p>
 <p>
  But,
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s alright, Guardian.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you mean alright? You’re up against Hojo!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why would I use a knife meant for killing a cow on a chicken?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What, what…?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can handle someone like Hojo.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon hearing this, Bijang involuntarily squared his shoulders.
 </p>
 <p>
  Am I the knife meant for a cow? And Hojo is the chicken?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hm. Be that as it may. Hojo isn’t an opponent to be taken lightly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bijang’s tone became gentler.
 </p>
 <p>
  “He’s one of the five great generals of the Wind Empire. Even if you’re recognized by the Imperial family as the master of the divine beast, it won’t be easy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded slightly in agreement.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That’s not wrong.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The leader of the Phoenix Corps, Hojo.
 </p>
 <p>
  The giant named Bijang was an incredibly strong mid-level boss.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though he was from the giant tribe, his skill in wielding a huge blade as if it were a light sword was unmatched.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, even in the Diamond League of the game, the task of facing Hojo was always left to Bijang.
 </p>
 <p>
  Many teams rashly challenged Hojo only to have over half of their party members swept away by his great sword, leading to the end of the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But I don’t think I’d lose in my current state.”
 </p>

 <p>
  In the Silver rank, he wouldn’t have dared to fight against Hojo.
 </p>
 <p>
  But after advancing to the Gold rank, he felt significantly stronger.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if he couldn’t overpower Hojo, he was confident he could survive his blade.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘To earn Bijang’s approval, it’s worth trying once.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, determined to attempt various strategies to complete the epic quest, said, “It’s rare for a Supreme Commander to lead the battlefield, right? Leave it to me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… How can I treat a guest of the Imperial family like an underling?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Imperial Gatekeeper is definitely someone who can.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Indeed! Haha!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bijang chuckled, touching the tip of his nose.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having a guest from the Imperial family acknowledge him like this eased some of his past resentments.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Still, it won’t be easy. Alright… Take this!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  A grand spear from behind Bijang flew up into the air and flickered white before releasing a bolt of lightning in front of Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  In response, a spear, shimmering with lightning, appeared before him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is this…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve imparted some of the power of the Thunder to you. Absorb it into your spear.”
 </p>
 <p>
  This is just a part of it?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan stared at the lightning-imbued spear in front of him.
 </p>
 <p>
  The spear’s power seemed comparable to that of the Phoenix Flag, an SS-grade weapon.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If this is just a part, the main body of the ThunderCloud Spear is definitely SSS-grade. I must obtain it by any means necessary.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought as he approached the Phoenix Flag to the lightning spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he did, the Phoenix Flag began to fuse with the spear, releasing sparks and white light.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed the combined powers of Flame and Thunder in the Phoenix Flag couldn’t fully integrate.
 </p>
 <p>
  But as the lightning touched Seong Jihan’s right hand:
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Thundercloud Spear reacts with your Thunder Seal.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The sparks started to subside.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Thunder resonated with the crown-shaped Thunder Seal engraved on Seong Jihan’s right hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The power of the Lightning amplifies, and the Thunder recognizes the player as its master.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Thunder Seal increases by 2.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh. It increased my stats…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Thunder, after raising Seong Jihan’s Thunder Seal stat by 2, settled peacefully into the Phoenix Flag.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seeing the Thunder so docile, you truly are worthy to be its master!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan easily controlled the Thunder, Bijang opened his mouth in admiration.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the same time,
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have gained Bijang’s recognition.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A notification appeared, indicating that the first condition of the epic quest was met.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan slightly widened his eyes looking at the message window.
 </p>
 <p>
  Receiving recognition already?
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s so different from the last time.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ve gained a lot thanks to the Phoenix Flag.’Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps it was due to the Phoenix shape of the Phoenix Flag.
 </p>
 <p>
  Initially mistaking Seong Jihan for an Imperial guest, Bijang now recognized him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Now, all I need to do is save him.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering how much Bijang judged people by their appearance, Seong Jihan thought it would be harder to earn his recognition than saving him.
 </p>
 <p>
  This felt like a significant step towards completing the epic quest.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, things didn’t unfold smoothly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What on earth…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom! Boom! Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  From across the bridge,
 </p>
 <p>
  A giant hurriedly approached.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was Hojo, the leader of the Phoenix Corps, dressed in black armor.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was visibly excited, distorting his already contorted face even more.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Phoenix, Phoenix! The Phoenix is here!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Is it because he’s the master of the Phoenix Corps?
 </p>
 <p>
  Hojo was extremely excited to see the Phoenix.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who is the owner of the Phoenix! Ah! Is it you?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Hojo, who was looking around from the bridge for the Phoenix’s master, widened his eyes when he saw Seong Jihan blocking his path.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, no, not you. You there! What is your name!”
 </p>
 <p>
  He again widened his eyes at the sight of Seong Jihan blocking his path.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why do you want to know?”
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  “Come to the Wind Empire! If you bring the Phoenix as it is, I will hand over my position as the leader of the Phoenix Corps! I will become the vice leader and serve you!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Hojo, looking at the blessing of the Phoenix soaring in the sky, shouted, spitting out his words.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was desperately eager to secure the Phoenix.
 </p>
 <p>
  – I’ve never seen Hojo act like this before. Why is he so excited?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Lol, wasn’t he a calm character?
 </p>
 <p>
  – What’s going to happen now?
 </p>
 <p>
  – I don’t know lol. It has long derailed from the original defense game plot.
 </p>
 <p>
  The game had taken a completely different turn from the usual ‘Lone Bridge’ scenario, and even the long-time viewers on BattleNet couldn’t predict the next move.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was also the case for Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is the first time someone has tried to persuade me like this.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With just one Phoenix Flag, he couldn’t even guess how far the butterfly effect would spread.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was curious about how the game would change if he accepted that proposal, but
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Still, I should complete the epic quest first.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to first secure the Thundercloud Spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What if I refuse?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then… be subdued quietly!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Hojo, as if anticipating the answer, quickly drew his blade and slashed down at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed, it was a mid-level boss-worthy strike that could challenge even the Diamond rank players.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pressed by the wind pressure to the point where he couldn’t even move, Seong Jihan felt
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What’s happening?’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was surprising from Seong Jihan’s perspective, who was on the receiving end of the attack.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was weak.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hojo’s movement was much slower than what he had experienced before.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Did he hold back?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps he was adjusting his strength because he had to subdue, not kill.
 </p>
 <p>
  If that’s the case, it would only be right to give him a piece of his own medicine.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whizz!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan easily dodged the strike and channeled energy into his Phoenix Flag.
 </p>
 <p>
  The power of the Thunder and the Phoenix Flag combined, sending a white flame-infused spearhead towards Hojo.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nameless Divine Arts, Divine Thunder Decree – Striking Thunderbolt
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzzzap!
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps due to the added power of Thunder, the Striking Thunderbolt was cast faster than usual.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hojo, not typical of a giant, tried to avoid it with agile movement, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  Screech!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh, aghh……!”
 </p>
 <p>
  He couldn’t beat the speed of the lightning.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unable to fully evade the attack, Hojo was hit on his left arm by the Striking Thunderbolt.
 </p>
 <p>
  In an instant, his arm was engulfed in flames and turned to ash.
 </p>
 <p>
  A look of shock was evident in Hojo’s eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How… how do you have such power…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Rather, why are you so weak?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan tilted his head as if he wanted to ask that.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t like Hojo was a weak character.
 </p>
 <p>
  Wasn’t he the giant race that went head-to-head with Bijang?
 </p>
 <p>
  He never imagined that one Striking Thunderbolt would turn his arm to ash.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He wasn’t holding back out of mercy.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who was proud of his judgment skills from living as a Ranker, could roughly guess the power difference between himself and Hojo based on his past experiences.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, he decided to fight Hojo, thinking he could withstand him.
 </p>
 <p>
  But to lose an arm with just one blow?
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers watching this scene went wild.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially the viewers in Seong Jihan’s fan club, The First, were all fired up.
 </p>
 <p>
  – OMG! The First, please accept new members! From now on, I’ll blindly support Seong Jihan!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Blindly? Nah, this is the most rational place.
 </p>
 <p>
  – What exactly did he do…? It seems he got a buff from Bijang again, but how much…?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Didn’t you about ‘Limits’? Lol. Stop analyzing and just trust and follow
 </p>
 <p>
  – That’s the thing. Lol. As a result of blindly following Jihan, I’m moving to Gangnam ^^
 </p>
 <p>
  “You…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, Hojo’s face turned red with rage.
 </p>
 <p>
  Being called weak by such a puny human was the utmost humiliation.
 </p>
 <p>
  The arm that turned to ash regenerated in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I won’t show any mercy!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Hojo roared fiercely and lunged at Seong Jihan.

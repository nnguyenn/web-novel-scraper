  Chapter 118
 </p>
 <p>
  The battle between Seong Jihan and Hojo.
 </p>
 <p>
  From anyone’s point of view, the odds were clearly tilted in favor of Hojo, the leader of Phoenix Corps.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan had indeed showcased his incredible performance up till now, he was just a player who had recently reached the Gold rank.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the other hand, Hojo was a formidable mid-boss reigning on ‘Lone Bridge’, a map that’s even used in the Diamond League.
 </p>
 <p>
  In defense map strategies, the standard approach was to just leave the task of dealing with Hojo to Bijang.
 </p>
 <p>
  When their clash began:
 </p>
 <p>
  – Uhm… Do you think Ji-Han can win?
 </p>
 <p>
  – How can he even think of defeating Hojo? ㅋㅋㅋㅋ But Bijang might help if he just holds on for a bit.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Yeah, I noticed earlier that Bijang became unexpectedly friendly towards Ji-Han. He probably won’t abandon him
 </p>
 <p>
  – As long as Ji-Han doesn’t get killed by Hojo before that~~^^7
 </p>
 <p>
  – That seems tough ㅋㅋㅋㅋ.
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers naturally expected Bijang to intervene in their battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  And so did Seong Jihan, who had challenged Hojo.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ve already been acknowledged.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Originally, Seong Jihan had intended to face Hojo to gain Bijang’s recognition, but he somehow absorbed the lightning, getting acknowledged beforehand.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, he didn’t really need to fight Hojo, but seeing the Phoenix made Hojo rush at him leading to the battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before clashing with Hojo, Seong Jihan organized his thoughts.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should hold him off for a while, and once Bijang comes to help, we can jointly defeat him.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He couldn’t ignore Bijang, who had become friendly thanks to the Phoenix Flag.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  Things didn’t go as expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This… This lightning… What on earth…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzzap!
 </p>
 <p>
  The powerful lightning from the Phoenix device shot out, and Hojo hastily used his sword to block it.
 </p>
 <p>
  He managed to deflect the main lightning bolt, but the residual lightning flowed into his hand and arm, charring them.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why… Why is it so strong!?”
 </p>
 <p>
  His skin melted instantly, even the blood, flesh, and bone beneath it disintegrated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks to the Giant race’s rapid regeneration ability, his disappearing arms and hands were instantly regenerated.
 </p>
 <p>
  But Hojo looked confused.
 </p>
 <p>
  The physical strength of the Giant race isn’t this weak.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t a direct hit from the lightning, so it was surprising that residual current could do this much damage.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I wonder.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, seemingly curious himself, aimed the tip of his spear at him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  Another bolt of white lightning shot towards Hojo.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kuk…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  He hurriedly tried to block it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to the retreating Hojo, Seong Jihan’s Striking Thunderbolt grew even more powerful.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Using Divine Thunder Decree is so effortless.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With the addition of the rare stat “Thunder Seal”, and the merging of the Thundercloud Spear, he could use the Striking Thunderbolt as easily as a basic skill.
 </p>
 <p>
  By this point, the exploration seemed over.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s see how far I can go.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As if just starting, Seong Jihan consecutively cast Striking Thunderbolt.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rumble!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Hojo’s sword danced brilliantly trying to block the lightning.
 </p>
 <p>
  But he couldn’t stop all of Seong Jihan’s Striking Thunderbolt that was cast with full force.
 </p>
 <p>
  Direct hits from the Striking Thunderbolt enveloped him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The affected parts of his body immediately went up in white flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  In no time, the burning flesh turned to dust.
 </p>
 <p>
  The giant’s body parts broke off, falling to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can’t… believe this…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwish~
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks to his regeneration ability, Hojo recovered his limbs.
 </p>
 <p>
  But he had already lost half his fighting spirit.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just one bolt of that lightning was enough to send parts of him flying, how could he possibly continue the fight?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing Hojo, who couldn’t muster the courage to charge, Seong Jihan remarked:
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you an undead?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You… What nonsense are you spouting?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Considering how weak you are against lightning, you seem like an undead.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s an extreme weakness of the undead: Divine Thunder Decree.
 </p>
 <p>
  Added to this are the Thundercloud Spear and the powerful white flames of the Phoenix that’s also effective against the undead.
 </p>
 <p>
  The power thunder emitted by Seong Jihan was no different from the ultimate weapon against the great undead.

 <p>
  “It doesn’t look like an undead at all from the outside…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Its appearance was just like Bijang, resembling a giant.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no feel of the unique deathly aura of the undead.
 </p>
 <p>
  When regenerated, it returned in its full flesh and blood form.
 </p>
 <p>
  Except for its ridiculous weakness to the lightning, there was no evidence that it was undead.
 </p>
 <p>
  Was that why?
 </p>
 <p>
  Hojo strongly denied Seong Jihan’s guess.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What nonsense are you talking about! I’m an undead!?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, we’ll know if you die.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Nameless Divine Arts, Divine Thunder Decree – Lightning Body
 </p>
 <p>
  Sizzling…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s body slowly became transparent, and white lightning rose on his body.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Lightning Body that equates himself with lightning.
 </p>
 <p>
  Its appearance was a bit different from when he usually used it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s no need to stick to the basics.”
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s no need to merge with just the energy of thunder in Lightning Body.
 </p>
 <p>
  Absorbing and integrating the White Flame of the Phoenix would be more effective against the undead.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan’s body became transparent, white flames began to rise.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Cough…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Hojo shuddered slightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  He instinctively felt that this power was his nemesis.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish! Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  Denying that sensation, Hojo fiercely swung his blade towards Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  The giant’s blade strike, which disappeared and regenerated several times, was still powerful.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hojo’s great blade swiftly touched Seong Jihan’s head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This, this can’t be!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bijang, who was watching the battle from behind, hurried forward, but it was already too late.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like Hojo’s great blade would split Seong Jihan’s head in half at any moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  But…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The great blade couldn’t proceed any further from Seong Jihan’s forehead.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sizzling…!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  He couldn’t overcome the lightning emitted by Seong Jihan in his Lightning Body state.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Hojo approached Seong Jihan, his whole body seemed to be on fire.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This… is impossible…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  He was extremely vulnerable to the lightning conducted through the great blade.
 </p>
 <p>
  The giant’s arm disappeared and regenerated repeatedly, seeming to let go of the great blade at any moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then…
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Thundercloud Spear thrown hastily by Bijang from behind struck Hojo.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sizzle!
 </p>
 <p>
  Although it was also a lightning-attribute weapon, Bijang’s Thundercloud Spear didn’t pierce Hojo as easily as Seong Jihan’s did.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead, the lightning from the Thundercloud Spear was absorbed into Hojo’s armor and disappeared without any effect.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is what it should be… How?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing this, Hojo shouted in frustration.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Thunderbolt thrown by Bijang, the owner of the Thundercloud Spear, was blocked by the armor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Why was he so defenseless against this human?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Amazing, isn’t it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thunk!
 </p>
 <p>
  The White Flame of the Phoenix pierced through Hojo’s body in one go.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike Bijang’s attack just a moment ago,
 </p>
 <p>
  The white spear pierced the giant’s heart without any resistance.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why am I so weak against him?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Hojo couldn’t answer Seong Jihan’s question.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whooosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  With his heart pierced, Hojo burned to ashes in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  And as if to confirm Hojo’s death,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Special Achievement, ‘Defeat Hojo.’ has been cleared.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Achievement points 10,000 rewarded.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Special Achievement, ‘Defeat Hojo Alone.’ has been cleared.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Achievement points 30,000 rewarded.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Achievement messages popped up, and only the blade and armor of Hojo, who lost its master, fell onto the cloud bridge.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bijang, who was hurriedly coming to assist Seong Jihan, was speechless upon seeing the scene.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hojo…is he dead?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bijang couldn’t comprehend the situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hojo, the great leader of the Phoenix Corps.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  Bijang, also of the giant clan, knew better about Hojo’s strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the five strongest warriors of the Wind Empire.
 </p>
 <p>
  He wasn’t the type to fall so powerlessly to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Why did Hojo die so quickly?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wasn’t he originally harder than the final boss of this map?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Yeah, his damage is high and his regenerative ability is insane; it’s a common strategy to just let Bijang deal with him.
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers watching Seong Jihan’s broadcast were equally shocked.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the defense map, ‘Lone Bridge’, even though Hojo appeared as a mid-level boss, his patterns were tricky and his regenerative abilities were extreme, making him tougher than the final boss from the player’s perspective.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, players usually let Hojo fight with Bijang, saving their energy to face the final boss.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, that powerful being was easily shattered by Seong Jihan’s spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Whoa… Was Hojo really an undead? Then he’s weak to holy power?
 </p>
 <p>
  – No, I don’t think so? From the experiments before, he had strong resistance against both holy and elemental magics.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Right, he handled the lightning Bijang threw just fine earlier.
 </p>
 <p>
  While it wasn’t unusual for Seong Jihan’s game to have unexpected turns, defeating Hojo this time was especially incomprehensible.
 </p>
 <p>
  Why did Hojo show a perfect compatibility only with Seong Jihan?
 </p>
 <p>
  “What… how did you do that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, if I were to guess, Hojo seemed vulnerable to the Phoenix’s flames. He couldn’t resist the combined power of the Phoenix’s white flames with the thunder.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The leader of the Phoenix Corps is weak to the power of the Phoenix… That’s peculiar.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who unexpectedly dominated, thought the Phoenix’s white flames were the variable.
 </p>
 <p>
  The combination of White Flame, Divine Thunder Decree, and Thundercloud Spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though these have extreme compatibility against the undead and their combined effect was impressive,
 </p>
 <p>
  it was unnatural for a strong foe like Hojo to disappear as if he had a weakness.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Secure the divine beast!”
 </p>
 <p>
  On the other hand, the Phoenix Corps, having lost its great lord, didn’t mention anything about Hojo and were singularly focused on capturing the Phoenix floating in the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Charge!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud thud thud thud…!
 </p>
 <p>
  From the other side of the cloud bridge, a cavalry unit charged in perfect formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching them, Bijang chuckled as if he found them amusing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What audacity! Charging without Hojo?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thump! Thump!
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, Bijang walked in front of Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You rest for a bit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Holding his spear, he single-handedly charged at the Phoenix Corps.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the game had proceeded normally, Bijang, after battling with Hojo, would be exhausted.
 </p>
 <p>
  But, thanks to Hojo being easily subdued by Seong Jihan, Bijang was in prime condition.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang! Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  Swinging his massive Thundercloud Spear like a club, Bijang instantly decimated the cavalry unit.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Phoenix Corps numbered in the hundreds, but against the narrow bridge terrain and Bijang’s overwhelming strength, they were helpless.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He fights well.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Bijang said, their charge was futile against the giant.
 </p>
 <p>
  Every time Bijang swung his Thundercloud Spear, which was as big as a small telephone pole,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Arghhh……!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Members of the Phoenix Corps couldn’t withstand the attack and fell off the cliff.
 </p>
 <p>
  Given the difference in strength, it made sense to give up the charge.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Secure the divine beast!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The black spear soldiers seemed to have lost their minds, focusing only on the divine beast and relentlessly charging like moths to a flame.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Have they gone mad?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom! Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  Even as Bijang mercilessly flung the spear soldiers away, somehow, the black spear soldiers continued to find openings, attempting to approach Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if they got close, it was of no use.
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to Hojo, their capabilities were considerably weaker.
 </p>
 <p>
  Chiieeek!
 </p>
 <p>
  They were all easily pierced by the Phoenix’s White Flames, turning into dust and disappearing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Chiieeek!
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘These guys also disappear like Hojo…’
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s peculiar how those who bear the name of the Phoenix are the weakest to the flames of the Phoenix.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels
 </p>
 <p>
  He didn’t understand the reason for this, but for now, he considered them as experience points.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he was about to eliminate all the Black Spear Soldiers,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait a moment!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the Spear Soldiers who were recklessly approaching him, one of them suddenly seemed to come to his senses.
 </p>
 <p>
  Startled, he urgently said, “This… this can’t be… Please spare me! I will tell you everything!”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Finally, it happened.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was an event that usually occurred as the second wave, the assault of the Black Spear Soldiers, was nearing its end.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ‘Black Spear Soldier who regained his sanity’.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was an essential event that always took place before the final boss battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  Through his confession, the weakness of the final boss of this map was revealed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Using this information to target the boss’s vulnerability while defending the bridge was the ultimate battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This… seems easier than I thought.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan waited for him to speak.

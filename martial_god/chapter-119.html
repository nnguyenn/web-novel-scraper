  Chapter 119
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Emperor, who had passed away, suddenly came back to life one day…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The story told by the spear soldier was one already familiar to Seong Jihan, who had cleared this map before.
 </p>
 <p>
  It spoke of the former emperor of the Wind Empire who died a year ago but suddenly resurrected.
 </p>
 <p>
  This emperor reclaimed his throne from his son and launched a massive invasion against the Cloud Empire.
 </p>
 <p>
  His primary objective in doing so was to obtain the ‘Divine Beasts’.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Emperor said he sought a Divine Beasts to offer to the Phoenix that resurrected him. As you know, when we talk about Divine Beasts, it’s the Cloud Empire, right? Hence, the Emperor broke the non-aggression treaty and prepared for a full-scale invasion.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “… And he specifically ordered that the Azure Dragon and the Phoenix be secured at all costs. There was a spell on the entire Phoenix Corps, but it seems I was fortunate enough to escape it… When I saw the Phoenix, I lost my mind.”
 </p>
 <p>
  For an NPC pleading for his life, this ‘Awakened Black Spear Soldier’ sure was verbose.
 </p>
 <p>
  The character seemed like a lore dump.
 </p>
 <p>
  – When will this damn lore end?
 </p>
 <p>
  – This map has the most dialogue, damn it.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Now that Seong Jihan summoned the Phoenix, there’s even more dialogue.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Just tell us the boss’s weakness already!
 </p>
 <p>
  Given that even Diamond rankers played on this map, the viewers were familiar with the NPC’s dialogue.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although a few lines had been added because Seong Jihan summoned the Phoenix, in essence, it boiled down to the Wind Empire’s resurrected emperor’s invasion.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm, is that so…? Emperor Chojyo resurrected using the power of the Phoenix?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I didn’t even know a real phoenix existed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “One thing I’m curious about: Why did they not use the original phoenix flag and instead use a blackbird flag? Wasn’t it originally red?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Phoenix’s symbolic color was fiery red. Yet, the banners and the undead from the invading Feng Empire all bore a blackbird.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Bijang inquired about this, the spear soldier replied, “Because the phoenix that appeared was black.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A black phoenix?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. So, the Emperor ordered all flags within the empire to be changed… If not, the phoenix’s offspring would punish them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The moment the spear soldier mentioned the phoenix’s offspring, a loud flapping noise resonated from the sky, and he screamed in terror.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They’re here! Those creatures!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Those creatures.
 </p>
 <p>
  The final bosses of the One-Leg map had appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They’re here.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The bosses of the One-Leg map, the Phoenix’s ‘Offsprings’.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather than a single entity, it was a swarm of large birds, all merged together.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the approaching flock, Bijang murmured in disbelief.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What the hell? Those sizes… They’re the offspring of the Phoenix?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes… Those are indeed the Phoenix’s offspring…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How can they be offspring!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bijang and the spear soldier were both in shock, but for Seong Jihan and the viewers, it was a familiar scene.
 </p>
 <p>
  – He came this far In Gold…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Not surprising anymore, lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Can they clear it?
 </p>
 <p>
  – But since Hojo is dead, it’s almost a guaranteed win, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Yeah, if there’s no Hojo, Bijang will probably help out.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the Phoenix’s offspring were not weak, Hojo, the leader of Phoenix Corps, had been a notoriously challenging opponent in the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, with his absence, the game’s outcome looked promising.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, there was another factor assisting in countering the Phoenix’s offspring.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They look pretty strong!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I… I know their weakness!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The spear soldier mentioned a ‘fatal weakness’.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The real one has a blue beak!”
 </p>
 <p>
  While all the Phoenix’s offspring looked identical, their beak colors were diverse, each sporting one of five different shades.
 </p>
 <p>
  The genuine offspring changed its color randomly with every game.
 </p>
 <p>
  – So the real one’s blue this time.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Is the number the same, 5?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Yeah, same number. 25 divided into five colors.
 </p>
 <p>
  When the real one is attacked, the fakes also get damaged and vanish along with it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s such a weakness, so even though the Phoenix’s offspring is the final boss of this map, it’s been considered weaker than the Hojo.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Blue color… How do you know about that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Only the chick with a blue beak ate the sacrificial offerings. The rest were becoming transparent from behind.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm, okay. Let’s start the attack with the one with the blue beak.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, and about mixing the Phoenix’s power into Striking Thunderbolt, it’s best to refrain as much as possible…”
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed that due to the floating phoenix, the spear soldier was about to add something more.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that remark, Seong Jihan tilted his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Striking Thunderbolt?’
 </p>
 <p>
  How does the NPC spear soldier know of the existence of the Striking Thunderbolt?
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan looked at the spear soldier with curious eyes,
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, his mouth stopped.
 </p>
 <p>
  No, not only his mouth,
 </p>
 <p>
  The entire world had stopped.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The system detects an anomaly in the NPC’s dialogue…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [An unauthorized terminal of the Constellation has infiltrated the game.]

 <p>
  [Expelling the opponent.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What…?’
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  In the paused world, the spear soldier slowly brushed his hair back.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  “Damn. I wanted to talk to ‘the head’ for a moment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Spear soldier, referring to Seong Jihan as ‘the head’.
 </p>
 <p>
  Such an opponent was predictable.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Constellation of the Dead Star, huh?’
 </p>
 <p>
  How did it get in when it was prohibited from approaching Earth?
 </p>
 <p>
  “I briefly possessed the body of an old servant, but you caught on.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Expulsion procedure in progress. 5. 4…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, got it. Hey head, be careful with the birds! They are dangerous, so don’t get caught! Especially, don’t mix in the power of the Phoenix! The ‘tree’ can detect you!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Spear soldier urgently warning Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was advice filled with genuine concern.
 </p>
 <p>
  “See you next time!”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a final wave, the spear soldier, the only moving entity in the paused world, also stopped.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Resuming the game.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Only after this system message appeared did the game resume.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh… Why?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The spear soldier, who had warned against using the power of the phoenix, looked puzzled and then wondered aloud,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why did you stop talking?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, nothing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  – What’s up with him?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Was there a mismatch while adding dialogue in real-time from BattleNet?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Lol, since when did BattleNet become such a fancy game platform?
 </p>
 <p>
  – It doesn’t seem like BattleNet has been perfect since the last Top 100 game, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers watching the game, apparently not having heard the earlier dialogue, were only commenting on the spear soldier’s stuttering.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘BattleNet… Isn’t it too easily breached?’
 </p>
 <p>
  It hasn’t even been a week since the end of the Top 100 match, yet another intrusion?
 </p>
 <p>
  There was definitely a hole somewhere in the BattleNet system.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘And, was that spear soldier originally a servant of the Constellation?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Expository spear soldier.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was strange that the pleading soldier calmly explained the situation and even knew the enemy boss’s weakness.
 </p>
 <p>
  He thought it was just a conveniently created NPC by the system, but it seemed that wasn’t the case.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What’s the problem with mixing the Striking Thunderbolt and the White Flame of the Phoenix?’
 </p>
 <p>
  If the Phoenix itself was the problem, he would have told him to put away the floating Phoenix he was currently using as a buff.
 </p>
 <p>
  What he pointed out was specifically mixing the two powers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Could this be related to how the Hojo was so easily defeated earlier?
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was contemplating these recent events,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel, who had been left at the entrance of the bridge, approached and spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can you use me to catch those birds?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Those creatures are under the protection of the World Tree and are the enemies who prey on our kind.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recalled the warning given by Karlein.
 </p>
 <p>
  The advice that the ‘tree’ can detect you.
 </p>
 <p>
  Did the tree signify the World Tree?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘In the last life, the World Tree Alliance and Kill the King acted in tandem to destroy the Earth… weren’t they not on good terms?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon reflection, they didn’t have a direct connection.
 </p>
 <p>
  The World Tree Alliance only caused Earth’s league ranking to plummet in the Space League.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kill the King had sprung from the dungeons and eradicated Earthlings.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Otherworldly forces are also complicated.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was contemplating this,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel, perhaps sensing his discomfort, said anxiously, “If you capture that corrupted phoenix with Eclipse, your Shadow Sword stat will increase.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really? Then I have to catch it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan suddenly stopped pondering.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether it’s the World Tree Alliance or Kill the King,
 </p>
 <p>
  If his stats would increase, he couldn’t resist.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan reached out to Ariel.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shhhh~
 </p>
 <p>
  The shadow elf disappeared, and a shadow sword was held in Seong Jihan’s left hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You… What is that…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the solemn shadow elf transformed into a sword, Bijang widened his eyes in surprise.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I will handle it Gatekeeper. Please take care of the barriers.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you not need help?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan firmly asked not to intervene, and even stuck his Phoenix Flag into the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm. Isn’t that too reckless? Maybe I should help…”
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

 </div>
 <p>
  “I told you I’m fine!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Nameless Divine Arts, Footwork Technique – Flashing Sky Thunder Steps
 </p>
 <p>
  If he’s on the ground, will Bijang help him?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan quickly soared into the sky, using his Footwork Technique.
 </p>
 <p>
  To anyone watching, he was clearly eager about the stat.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Is he rushing because he thinks Bijang will help?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Why did he leave the Phoenix Flag behind tho? LOL.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Diamond rankers form teams to catch bosses like this. Isn’t he being too reckless?
 </p>
 <p>
  – It’s Seong Jihan, after all.
 </p>
 <p>
  – He even defeated Hojo~
 </p>
 <p>
  Kiiiik!
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan soared, shadowy grotesque clones started to charge at him one by one.
 </p>
 <p>
  Maybe they deemed that a single human-like Seong Jihan didn’t require all of them at once.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Phoenix’s offspring seemed relaxed.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  [This is my speciality.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the extended shadow sword touched the Phoenix’s offspring,
 </p>
 <p>
  Before even slicing their skin, they started to get absorbed directly into the shadow sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kiik! Kiiik!
 </p>
 <p>
  The grotesque beings twisted to escape as they were pulled into the sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  But they couldn’t resist the sword’s absorption, and were completely drawn in.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh. They can’t resist at all?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [They are mere shells that had their ‘immortality’ taken away by the World Tree. They are nothing but shadows left from the original Phoenixes.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Saying that they can’t resist the shadow sword, Ariel spoke confidently.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I’ll keep catching them.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Kiiiik!
 </p>
 <p>
  And so, after easily swallowing ten of them with the shadow sword,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your Shadow Sword stat increased by 1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A message made Seong Jihan smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Today, it’s quite easy.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile,
 </p>
 <p>
  Kiiiiik…
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike before, the Phoenix’s offspring hesitated upon seeing the shadow sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  [They are trying to flee. We must catch them quickly.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Ah, I can’t let them go.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Nameless Divine Arts, Dark Shadow Technique – Dark Soul Vortex
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan approached the Phoenixes, using the Dark Soul Vortex.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the shadow sword swirled and grew in size……
 </p>
 <p>
  Kiiiiiiik!
 </p>
 <p>
  One by one, the horde of monsters was sucked powerlessly into the Dark Soul Vortex.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among them, the main body with a blue beak held out a bit longer.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stop this futile resistance!]
 </p>
 <p>
  As Ariel said, it didn’t last long and vanished without a trace.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this manner, the 24th monster was absorbed in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally, only the monster with the blue beak remained.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kiiiiii…
 </p>
 <p>
  Even while being disintegrated by the Dark Soul Vortex, the last monster resisted for quite some time.
 </p>
 <p>
  But it was just prolonging its inevitable fate.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whooosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The monster’s eyes blazed as it fixed its gaze on Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a piercing look, as if trying to see through him.
 </p>
 <p>
  But soon, flames erupted from its eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  From the beak of the monster, words were spat out.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;"Shadow. Worthless."&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  [What?! We’re worthless?!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Rarely showing such emotion, Ariel became angry.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dark Soul Vortex began swirling even more quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The monster could only stare at Seong Jihan for a short moment before being swiftly absorbed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You little…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Even till the end, the Phoenix’s offspring chick continued to provoke Ariel.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the last monster met its fate in the Dark Soul Vortex, a system message appeared before Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your Shadow Sword stat increased by 2.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You can no longer absorb the power of shadow from this monster.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Such restrictions are always so precise.”
 </p>
 <p>
  They should focus on security instead of placing these kind of limits.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan was satisfied with gaining Shadow Sword stats, the subsequent message made him slightly regretful.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, at least it increased by three.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Plus, the real reward is something else.”Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked down from the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  What he was looking at was the Thundercloud Spear held by the Empire’s Imperial Gatekeeper, Bijang.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was time to claim the reward from the epic quest.

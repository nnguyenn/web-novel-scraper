  Chapter 120
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who are you, exactly?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bijang stared at Seong Jihan with disbelief.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You effortlessly took down the monster horde, against which even I had to be prepared for death. And you used the power of darkness to do so.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was contemplating how to respond to Bijang’s accusation when his mouth opened involuntarily.
 </p>
 <p>
  A forced event had been activated.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can only tell you that I am affiliated with the secret division of the Royal Ascendancy, and nothing more.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The secret division… I see. I thought they would fail, but they managed to cultivate an exceptional talent like you. So, the experiment was a success?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Nodding as if convinced, Bijang pulled out the great spear from his back.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then I have my duty to fulfill.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What duty?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I will request assistance from the neutral giants. If they know Chojyo has resurrected, they will help. Meanwhile, guard this bridge with this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzzzz!
 </p>
 <p>
  From the great spear, white lightning emerged, coalescing into a sphere.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is the essence of the Thundercloud Spear. I’ll temporarily graft it onto your spear.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Tssssss~
 </p>
 <p>
  The essence of Thundercloud Spear interlocked with the Phoenix Flag, and it naturally absorbed into the Phoenix Flag as if they had always been one.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Tsk… Thundercloud, leaving without looking back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bijang briefly looked resentful at the Thundercloud that was readily absorbed into the Phoenix Flag and turned away.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, I entrust the bridge to you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  And with that, the giant Bijang started walking away. As Seong Jihan watched his back, system messages began to flood in.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have fully cleared the Defense Map, ‘Lone Bridge’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [For ranking 1st, your experience and GP acquisition rate increases by 50%.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [For a complete clear, you gain double the experience and GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You are a player who dominates the league. For appropriate league placement, additional experience is given.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your level has increased by 4.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’ve acquired 200,000 GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’ve cleared the Epic Quest.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’ve acquired 50,000 achievement points as a reward.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’ve acquired the Thundercloud Spear as a reward.]
 </p>
 <p>
  With that message, the logout of all players, including Seong Jihan, began.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow. Insane.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s over just like that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The rewards are crazy… how much GP is that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The participating players grinned from ear to ear as they looked at the reward message appearing before logout.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks to getting carried by Seong Jihan, they also received an insane amount of rewards.
 </p>
 <p>
  For a Gold player, playing one good game doesn’t usually lead to a level-up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite doing almost nothing in this battle, they all gained at least 1 level, with some gaining 2 levels for free.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So this is the famous Seong Jihan’s hard carry.’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I hope we’re on the same team next time.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As everyone joyfully logged out, Sophia turned to Yoon Seah, her face bright with happiness.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow… our levels just shot up. Right, Seah?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The two silvers, unlike the gold players, had risen more levels, both leveling up by 4, just like Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. Even though I didn’t really do anything…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah snapped her bowstring and spoke with a hint of disappointment.
 </p>
 <p>
  Given that it was a defense map, she thought she might have a chance to shoot some arrows, but her uncle finished it all by himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aren’t I taking too much advantage of uncle?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What does it matter? Seah, you can play one more game. Just show your skills there.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sophia, are you okay?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Me? I feel great. I even contributed enough to be ranked second this time. I gave Jihan a buff.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since Seong Jihan nearly finished the game by himself, it was only natural for Sophia, who had supported him by providing buffs, to rank second in contribution.
 </p>
 <p>
  “As a supporter, Jihan is someone who truly makes buffing worthwhile.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The way Sophia looked at Seong Jihan seemed even more intense than before.
 </p>
 <p>
  She already had a fondness for the warrior class, but today’s one-man show by him left an even deeper impression on her.
 </p>
 <p>
  After logging out, Seong Jihan checked his main reward, the Thundercloud Spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Thundercloud Spear (Grade: SS)]
 </p>
 <p>
  [This formless spear was created by the first emperor of the Cloud Empire by harnessing lightning.
 </p>
 <p>
  When fused with other equipment, it can demonstrate its full potential.
 </p>
 <p>
  Enhances the equipment it’s fused with and bestows the property of lightning.
 </p>
 <p>
  To fuse with equipment, the target equipment must be at least grade SS.
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon full recognition as the master of the Thundercloud, you will acquire the skill ‘Thunderstorm Summon’.
 </p>
 <p>
  Currently fused with the Phoenix Flag.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Thundercloud Spear, which Bijing had handed him, was designed to show
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <br/>
 <p>
  its real value when combined with other equipment.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Phoenix Flag as a weapon is around grade SS, but with Thundercloud, it might be usable as an SSS grade.’
 </p>
 <p>
  From the description, it seemed there was no strict requirement to fuse it with a spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ariel, can we fuse it with the Eclipse?”Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  [Thundercloud? You mean the lightning spear? Eclipse’s current grade is SS, so they might
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  counteract each other’s effects if combined.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What if it’s upgraded to SSS?”
 </p>
 <p>
  […Hmm. They wouldn’t interfere with each other, but I wouldn’t expect any synergy either.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, I should just keep it with the Phoenix Spear.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Having settled his feelings about Thundercloud, Seong Jihan then checked the achievement points he had earned.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I have 630,000.’
 </p>
 <p>
  When he last ranked up in the Top100 and dealt damage to the Constellation of the Dead Star, he had earned a whopping 300,000 achievement points.
 </p>
 <p>
  Today’s points were a significant addition to that.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s about time to use them.’
 </p>
 <p>
  First on his list was an upgrade to the store.
 </p>
 <p>
  After adding an Additional Constellation Slot and an Additional Gift Slot, Seong Jihan proceeded with the store upgrade.
 </p>
 <p>
  While 350,000 achievement points were swiftly deducted, he still had a lot left, so he wasn’t
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  too worried.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I wonder what’s added.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the deduction of 350,000 achievement points, he still had a substantial amount
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  remaining, so he wasn’t stressed about it.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Achievement Store has been upgraded to LV.7.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [A ‘Donation’ item has been added.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Donating achievement points to the system might bring unexpected luck!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Donate 10,000 points once a month!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who had high expectations for the new item, let out a chuckle at the sight of the ‘Donation’.
 </p>
 <p>
  Donation? Are they joking?
 </p>
 <p>
  [The level cap for each item has been increased.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Unlocking the cap will require achievement points.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The system messages that followed seemed more noteworthy.
 </p>
 <p>
  He felt extremely let down that after spending so many achievement points, the item he obtained was merely a ‘Donation’.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why would I do it?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Why would domineering entities like the BattleNet system need to receive achievement points as donations?
 </p>
 <p>
  Until that moment, he had vowed never to donate.
 </p>
 <p>
  [To upgrade the Achievement Store, all the lower upgrade items must be level 3 or above.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [To upgrade the Achievement Store, you must make 5 or more donations.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing that one of the requirements for the next shop upgrade was 5 donations, he furrowed his brow deeply.
 </p>
 <p>
  The rich getting richer, he thought, it’s exactly like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I should think of it as nonexistent points and just click it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a trembling finger, he clicked on the donation button.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have donated 10,000 points to the system!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Energy envelops you. For a month, you accumulate less fatigue.]
 </p>
 <p>
  He did feel a momentary lightness with that message, but his body was the epitome of health.
 </p>
 <p>
  A slight increase in vitality made no noticeable change.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover,
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Was there a limit of one donation per month?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover,
 </p>
 <p>
  He would’ve preferred to complete all 5 donations at once if possible, but the system, despite seemingly willing to accept, wouldn’t allow it.
 </p>
 <p>
  It felt like a tactic to curb the player’s growth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No choice, then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Trying to suppress his growing frustration, he decided to invest his remaining achievement points in other items.
 </p>
 <p>
  After all, to upgrade, growth in other items was also required.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the long list of items,he looked at an item that changed to “All for One” instead of the class item.
 </p>
 <p>
  [All for One LV.1]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Would you like to unlock the limit to LV.2?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You need 250,000 achievement points.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The All for One grade upgrade seemed more valuable than expanding the status window or inventory.
 </p>
 <p>
  He prioritized it and invested the achievement points.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The limit for All for One has increased to LV.2.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Another 250,000 needed for a level up?”
 </p>
 <p>
  When he had 630,000 points, he thought he could buy anything, but with just a few clicks, 610,000 points vanished.
 </p>
 <p>
  All he got was a strange donation item and the qualification for an All for One upgrade.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… There’s also the useless Gift Slot and Constellation Slot.”
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Looking at the mere 20,000 remaining achievement points, he felt a momentary sense of loss.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Forget it. No regrets.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Wasn’t the achievement point something almost worthless in his past life?
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s an achievement to use them this productively, he decided to think positively.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This month’s random box has an increased item appearance rate…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The monthly changing item in the random box.
 </p>
 <p>
  For October, the item was [Item].
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking he might try drawing from it later, he closed the Achievement Store.
 </p>
 <p>
  “More importantly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He opened his status window to check his remaining points.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  His level had increased by 4 from this game.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was a reason he could grow so quickly despite being Gold Rank.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There was an added system message.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You are a player who dominates the league. To reposition you to a league that matches your level, additional experience is given.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if it meant giving more experience, it was the system’s way of urging him to climb up quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  He seemed to have been given a bonus for wreaking havoc on the game balance so much.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I invest all the remaining points, my Martial Power will reach 97…’
 </p>
 <p>
  For the unification of the three Dantians, he believed he needed a power level of 100.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, he’s very close to his goal.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This time, I’ll succeed.’
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, on the same day, October 1st, the Northeast Asia BattleNet League match took place.
 </p>
 <p>
  The match between Korea and Taiwan unfolded.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ah…! The South Korean national team has lost again…!
 </p>
 <p>
  – How many losses in a row now? Especially with a loss to Taiwan, we’re almost confirmed to be at the bottom of the league!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ah, when will they ever get their first win…
 </p>
 <p>
  The Korean commentators relayed the national team’s defeat with a voice filled with sorrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  The South Korean national team still hasn’t filled the void left by the departure of the Sword King.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially after suffering a brutal defeat to Taiwan, who used to be considered the weakest.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did they lose again?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They even got crushed by Taiwan…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They can’t even compete at the bottom?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is a real problem…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The citizens who watched this started to worry about the national team’s future more than criticizing them.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If we continue to be overwhelmingly last, won’t our world ranking plummet?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right. Even if you look at other leagues, it’s rare to find countries with 0 wins like us. Our current national team’s performance is almost self-destructive.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh my, are we going to end up like North Korea?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even if dungeons appear, they said we can close them with the Exploration Gift.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s still in testing. And if a dungeon does appear, our economy is doomed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s true…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Although it was said that the Exploration Gift could locate dungeon cores, it wasn’t yet conclusively proven.
 </p>
 <p>
  And just the existence of a dungeon is detrimental to the country.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sooner or later, Seong Jihan has to step up!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Exactly! Why can’t they just add Seong Jihan to the national team now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, he’s just in the Gold tier. You need to be at least in Diamond to be on the national team.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But these days, no one else has his performance. Someone suggested it before and got cursed out, being called a The First fanatic.”
 </p>
 <p>
  To be qualified for the national team, one needed to be at least in the Diamond League.
 </p>
 <p>
  But suggesting Gold-ranked Seong Jihan was a wild idea.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, did you watch Seong Jihan’s game today? He defeated Hojo, and overwhelmingly so.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hojo? Do you mean the one from the Phoenix Corps? That giant?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, that Hojo.”
 </p>
 <p>
  But when Seong Jihan defeated Hojo in today’s game, those who were familiar with BattleNet games were genuinely surprised.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Man… even Diamond players would avoid him, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s what I’m saying! He’s stronger than a Diamond!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, I saw it. It seemed like Hojo didn’t know his own weakness. He was dominated too easily.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not that. It’s just that Seong Jihan is damn strong!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This guy, are you a The First fanatic? I watched the game too. Hojo was confused about why he was taking so much damage.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, I joined the fan club! At this rate, the national team is hopeless. Why not just try him out? How much longer will they be last?”
 </p>
 <p>
  With the news that Seong Jihan also defeated Hojo, one of The First’s new members suggested trying him out while drinking.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not our decision…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We can. Let’s start a national petition! Already gathered 100,000 signatures!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…100,000?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, let’s do it now! Sending the link!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Fine, whatever. I’ll sign it, but it’s not gonna happen.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Friends began participating in the petition after being convinced by one of their friends’ passionate pleas.
 </p>
 <p>
  And so, on the day South Korea suffered a crushing defeat against Taiwan, ironically, the number of citizens petitioning for Seong Jihan’s inclusion in the national team began to skyrocket.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What’s this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  And that was, even to the point of shocking the officials at the BattleNet Administration Office.

  <strong>
   Chapter 121
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  “The petition has already surpassed 300,000 signatures, so we hope for a sincere response to the public from the Management Department… Sigh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Oh Gyuseung, the newly appointed Director of the BattleNet Management Department, sighed as he read the official document in his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why the rush? If they just wait a bit, he will surely be selected as the national representative. How did it become such a hot issue in just one day?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Player Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Isn’t he the most promising player receiving worldwide attention?
 </p>
 <p>
  His performance has been so outstanding that the Management Department plans to select him as a national representative as soon as he gets promoted to Diamond.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just by looking at his growth rate, he seems like he’ll become a Diamond soon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems like yesterday’s defeat broadcast has triggered a sense of crisis.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Responding to the director’s lament, Manager Park Yoonsik, who had brought the document, cautiously spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They suffered a brutal defeat against Taiwan…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The linchpin of our national team strategy, Sword King, has gone to Japan. It was inevitable.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The basic strategy of the Korean national team was to use elite warriors to fend off enemy attacks and buy time, then launch powerful sniper attacks on the enemy’s core forces.
 </p>
 <p>
  This extreme strategy, heavily reliant on a few warriors for defense, might seem reckless at first glance.
 </p>
 <p>
  But with the Sword King, it worked almost invincibly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sword King was so strong that even with just a few warriors, not only did they cover the front, but they often crushed the enemy’s warrior camp.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, the long-range sniping of the archers proved effective.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, with the departure of the core member, Sword King, this strategy started to crumble.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes… Currently, our representative team’s front line is very weak. Among the competing countries in the Northeast Asia League, our warrior unit is by far the weakest.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right. Even yesterday, we were shattered by Taiwan’s warriors.”
 </p>
 <p>
  There was a sarcastic remark that all the warrior talent possessed by Korean players was concentrated in the Sword King.
 </p>
 <p>
  But it was true.
 </p>
 <p>
  Excluding Sword King, the other warriors were inferior compared to warriors from other countries.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially in the Northeast Asia League, considered the most competitive in the world, the disparity was glaring.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although this weakness was masked when the Sword King was around, it became obvious after he left.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Still, isn’t it a bit much to select a Gold player as a national representative?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “… It’s not impossible. When BattleNet first started, even Gold and Platinum players played in national representative matches.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But back then, there were no players who had leveled up to Diamond. It’s been 10 years now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That may be true, but according to our National Management Department’s regulations, while it may not be possible, as per the World BattleNet Association’s rules, it is. Hence the emphasis on this in the public petition.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Indeed, if the opposing nation selects a Gold player as a national representative, they would obviously not refuse. This is giving me a headache.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Oh Gyuseung clasped his head with both hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  Selecting a Gold player as a national representative, is that even reasonable? Honestly, he just wanted to buy some time.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘In just a short while, Seong Jihan will naturally move up to the upper leagues.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The current season of the Northeast Asia League is already doomed.
 </p>
 <p>
  With yesterday’s defeat against Taiwan, Korea’s last-place position is almost certain.
 </p>
 <p>
  He’d rather wait for Seong Jihan to rise naturally than hastily include him due to public pressure.
 </p>
 <p>
  But,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This reminds me of the previous Director…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The former Director, who unnecessarily picked a fight with Seong Jihan, came to his mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even with his strong backing from the political sector, he couldn’t maintain his position under public scrutiny.
 </p>
 <p>
  “To be frank, I think selecting a Gold player might be premature. Maybe if he was Platinum, but Gold… Plus, Seong Jihan will soon rank up anyway.”ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m
 </p>
 <p>
  “I feel the same. Selecting a Gold player as a national representative is burdensome for our department. Now, 300,000 have petitioned, but once he’s selected, there will be massive opposition.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “True. But I’m worried. After all the effort to mend ties between the Management Department and Seong Jihan, I don’t want this matter to cause another rift.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Manager Park Yoonsik recalled how the Director personally visited the head of a major guild to plead.
 </p>
 <p>
  “After all the hard work, it’d be a pity if our relationship turns sour again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But do you think Seong Jihan would even want to be a national representative?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t it obvious? Being a BattleNet national representative brings honor to the family name.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “While the petition has surpassed 300,000 signatures, if a Gold player becomes a national representative, there would be substantial opposition. Maybe he’d prefer to join later, rather than be criticized now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Oh Gyuseung nodded, as if Park Yoongsik made a valid point.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can you find out what he thinks?”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Me, sir?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Aren’t you the closest to Seong Jihan in the Management Department?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you mean, close?
 </p>
 <p>
  They just met most often at the management department, but it was always uncomfortable to meet in person.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, when the Director asked, he couldn’t say no.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Alright.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “And, subtly… if he wants to join the national team… not from Gold, but higher. Yes, ask if he would like to play from at least Platinum.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I shouldn’t have brought it up; now I’ve got more work.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Park Yoonsik regretted mentioning Seong Jihan and bowed to the Director of the Management Department.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Yes, I’ll look into it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  The same day.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was logging out after clearing today’s game.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I leveled up once today.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The game type he cleared this time was an “Invasion” map.
 </p>
 <p>
  While he had made significant progress in yesterday’s defense game, the Invasion map didn’t offer as much experience, so the reward was a bit slower.
 </p>
 <p>
  While checking the remaining points and calculating his level-up speed, Seong Jihan thought,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘At this rate, I might be able to participate in the October promotion match.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The level required to participate in the Gold to Platinum promotion match is 100.
 </p>
 <p>
  For a player who just moved up from Silver to Gold, achieving that in a month seemed impossible.
 </p>
 <p>
  But with the system generously giving Seong Jihan experience, he felt he could easily reach level 100 by the 25th.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Now that I’m in Gold, the survival and dungeon maps must have changed. I hope to get a new map.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A new map would likely give more experience.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Knock! Knock!
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah’s voice was heard along with a knock.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle. I… have something to say.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, come in.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, who entered Seong Jihan’s room, looked quite serious.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s up?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was thinking while playing the game today.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She began cautiously,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I think it’s time I stop getting carried by you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why? Not leveling up?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, I’m leveling up great. I gained 2 levels today.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is there something you’re uncomfortable with?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well… I feel like I’m not doing much. My actual skills aren’t improving, just my level.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded in understanding.
 </p>
 <p>
  It made sense. In today’s game, Yoon Seah’s contribution was virtually negligible.
 </p>
 <p>
  “With your Gift, you can play two games. Isn’t one of those enough for you to play with your skill?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well… maybe? I don’t think I can win the Top 100 with my skills right now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You were really aiming for that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course. I have to move my Gift to C grade, right? Winning the Top 100 is much faster than playing 500 games with a 60% win rate.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah spoke confidently.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing her, Seong Jihan chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright. Since you’ve already met the criteria to upgrade it to D grade, try leveling up on your own.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll have to contact Sophia to dissolve the party.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh… really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, there’s no need to maintain the party if I’m not helping you level up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon hearing this, Yoon Seah scratched her cheek.
 </p>
 <p>
  She had seen how much Sophia enjoyed partying with Seong Jihan. She felt guilty for potentially causing a rift.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh… Uncle, how about we just play in the party twice a week?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, it just seems a waste to dissolve the party completely! Hehe.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan had an inkling of why she was saying this but eventually agreed.
 </p>

 <p>
  ‘It’s possible she might not maintain a 60% win rate. I should at least help her win a couple of games.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, who now had two rare stats, could reasonably achieve a 60% win rate, but to Seong Jihan, she still had much to improve.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay, I’ll contact Sophia!”
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, Yoon Seah left the room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not long after, he got a call from Lee Hayeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Boss! A guest came from the Management Department.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Management Department?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. Manager Park Yoonsik is here… He said he wants to talk about the national team.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why suddenly the national team?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Uh… don’t you know that a petition to select you as the national player has passed 300,000 signatures?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was in disbelief.
 </p>
 <p>
  Why would they start a petition like that, and how did it get 300,000 signatures?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Did I have that many fans?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought so and replied to Lee Hayeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll head down to the guild for now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Guild office.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…So, the Management Department needs to respond to the national petition.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan listened as Manager Park Yoonsik explained the context of the recent petition.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did we lose to Taiwan that badly?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… Didn’t you watch the match yesterday?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, I was busy training.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan had been focusing solely on his preparation for an upcoming major tournament.
 </p>
 <p>
  Plus, he hadn’t bothered watching since he expected the national team to lose.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We lost pretty badly. Compared to other countries, Taiwan’s warrior group is relatively weaker, so we hoped for at least one win. But we were just overpowered.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How can a Gold player be selected for the national team? Isn’t the national team’s standard Diamond level 225 and above?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Diamond tier begins from level 200.
 </p>
 <p>
  But most of them felt a barrier at level 225.
 </p>
 <p>
  From that point, the experience gain drops significantly, and the experience loss from defeats becomes much bigger.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unless they were exceptionally skilled, most Diamonds remained between levels 200 and 225.
 </p>
 <p>
  Only those who surpassed that barrier were considered worthy of the national team.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, you’re right. In the Warrior division, there are some below that level though…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There were those below 225?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, due to a shortage of Warrior class players…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s a bit extreme.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He knew that the national team was in a dire situation, but he didn’t expect players below level 225 to be selected.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s evident that the void left by the Sword King is significant.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What do you think, Mr. Seong Jihan? Would you consider being a national representative?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “As I am still in the Gold Rank, it’s probably too…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was about to decline when a thought stopped him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Wait. If I get selected as a national representative as a Gold Rank, won’t I get a significant amount of achievement points?’
 </p>
 <p>
  He had recently spent over 600,000 points, which left him nearly broke.
 </p>
 <p>
  Being a national representative would surely offer an opportunity to replenish them.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But I shouldn’t be a burden on the national team with my insufficient skills.’
 </p>
 <p>
  His current level was 70, far from the levels of national players.
 </p>
 <p>
  It would be shameful to join the team solely for achievement points and end up being a burden.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still…
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll just watch yesterday’s match. Only the warrior division.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He was curious about the current standard of the national team.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay, it’s ready!”
 </p>
 <p>
  And so, Seong Jihan watched the highlight reel prepared by Lee Hayeon from yesterday’s match.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Oh no! They’re crumbling! The Korean national team…!
 </p>
 <p>
  – They just have to defend! Can’t they do that!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ah! Another defeat!
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Why are they so bad?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching the national warrior team quickly get trampled by Taiwanese warriors, Seong Jihan realized that being selected as a national representative wouldn’t be shameful at all.

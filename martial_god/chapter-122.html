  <strong>
   Chapter 122
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh, about that…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this really a game of the national team?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Yes. It was an official game played by the national team yesterday.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How disappointing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s words, Manager Park Yoonsik was lost for words.
 </p>
 <p>
  When he saw the video highlighting only Warrior Jin, he felt it was too much.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had come to persuade Seong Jihan that it wasn’t the right time for Gold to be the national representative.
 </p>
 <p>
  But after watching the video, he thought, ‘Maybe it’s better to just select Seong Jihan? They are bound to lose like this anyway.’
 </p>
 <p>
  “Considering they’re national-level Warriors, there should be at least one or two people capable of defeating me…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though Seong Jihan had a unique stat, there was a level gap of about 150 between him and them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, as one rises in rank, their class changes to a better job and they acquire various skills.
 </p>
 <p>
  The national representatives should be able to face the current Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  But…
 </p>
 <p>
  “I think I can defeat them all?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan calmly observed the movements of the national players and stated confidently.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, that’s a bit…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “To be honest, I was skeptical about Gold being the representative. But after seeing this video, it seems feasible.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, do you intend to become a national representative?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. If you select me, I will.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…..Alright.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Park Yoonsik couldn’t help but resent the national team players. If only they had played better in yesterday’s game!
 </p>
 <p>
  “I understand that this might be burdensome from the Management’s perspective. Especially since it’s about Gold Rank getting selected as national team player. We have 300,000 petitions now, but if he actually gets picked, the backlash won’t be easy to handle.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s true…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t intend to face criticism just to become a national representative.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “In that case…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m thinking of making a ‘small’, personal appeal on the guild channel.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What on earth are you planning to do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Park Yoonsik looked at Seong Jihan, who said he would make a ‘small’ appeal, with anxious eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  But he couldn’t stop him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Who could say no to the world’s most promising player who is now the talk of the global community?
 </p>
 <p>
  The relationship between BattleNet’s Management Department and Seong Jihan had completely changed ever since the previous Director was fired.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I understand…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Park Yoonsik, who had come to persuade Seong Jihan, could only respond weakly.
 </p>

 <p>
  [Racking up Guild Points with Boss~!]
 </p>
 <p>
  A live broadcast was being conducted on the guild channel after a long time.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hello~ everyone~”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon greeted with a bright smile, waving at the camera.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Oh, it’s been a while since the guild broadcast.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Seeing Ha-Yeon cleanses my soul!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Please broadcast more often!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Guild leader, V-log please!
 </p>
 <p>
  In the guild channel, Lee Hayeon, who was second in popularity only to Seong Jihan, made a V sign and smiled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “A V-log sounds fun~ I’ll try it out later! Now, today! It’s the much-anticipated point investment time!”
 </p>
 <p>
  – Are they already receiving guild points?
 </p>
 <p>
  – The 1st of every month is the day for point settlement.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Daegi Guild is a new guild from last month. It’s hard for a new guild to get points…
 </p>
 <p>
  Guild Points.
 </p>
 <p>
  When you first create a guild, you’re given 10 points.
 </p>
 <p>
  After that, points are given or deducted by BattleNet’s system based on the guild’s performance on the 1st of every month.
 </p>
 <p>
  The main criteria for evaluation included the achievements of guild members in the higher leagues.
 </p>
 <p>
  Additionally, the number of subscribers to the guild channel and the number of video views also added to this.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The points we received this month are… a whopping… 2 points!”
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wasn’t the Daegi Guild full of Silvers last month? Lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  – They already earned points?
 </p>
 <p>
  – I think it’s because of the many guild channel subscriptions.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Still, they got 2 points.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Isn’t it because Jihan won in the TOP 100?
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite being a guild that’s less than a month old, the fact that they received 2 points shocked those familiar with BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  As they discussed how a guild, which previously accepted only a few members, managed to earn 2 points so quickly.
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  “Alright, let’s discuss where we should invest these points and then bring in the Boss! Applause!”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Lee Hayeon made a clapping sound with both her mouth and hands, Seong Jihan entered the camera focus.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hello, everyone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  – The one and only Jihan bro has arrived!!!!!
 </p>
 <p>
  – I watched today’s game too~~ It was great~~^^7. You’re still dominating, huh~~
 </p>
 <p>
  – Well… that’s expected… Now… He has to be… first… always…
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan appeared, the chat that initially greeted him started to change.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Jihan bro!!! Please represent our countryㅠㅠ. At this rate, we’ll end up last.
 </p>
 <p>
  – The First ones are here too, doing their usual antics.
 </p>
 <p>
  – You should chat when he can see!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Stop it, top players.
 </p>
 <p>
  – What’s a top player?
 </p>
 <p>
  – They’re referring to The First ones spamming the petition.
 </p>
 <p>
  [TL/N: First and Top share the same character, hence the wordplay.]
 </p>
 <p>
  – Seriously, the spam is insane. What kind of Gold rank represents the country? Totally over the top.
 </p>
 <p>
  The chat was in chaos over the national representative issue that had been hot since yesterday.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I had asked Hayeon to bring up the topic, but it seems there’s no need now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Originally, after filming the Guild Point video, he intended to conclude with updates on the national representative topic.
 </p>
 <p>
  But seeing the passionate chat, it seemed there was no need for such staging.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll address the national representative issue after discussing the Guild Points.”
 </p>
 <p>
  – Woah, is he going to give an official response?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Seems the Gate of Hell is about to open ㅋㅋㅋㅋ.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wow, the viewer count is suddenly skyrocketing.
 </p>
 <p>
  – No one cares about guild points anymore ㅋㅋㅋ.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, hinting at his response to the national representative issue, calmly brought up the Guild Point window.
 </p>
 <p>
  Guild Member Expansion (5/10) – LV.5
 </p>
 <p>
  Stat Increase (All stats +5) – LV.5
 </p>
 <p>
  Growth Rate Increase (+150%) – LV.15
 </p>
 <p>
  – ???? Why is the level like that?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wasn’t the Growth Rate Increase just 11?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Have you already added the points?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wait, to say that, isn’t the added point +12?
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers were confused seeing the guild window Seong Jihan displayed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Why is that level like that?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the chat’s confusion, Seong Jihan nonchalantly answered,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, that. It’s the effect of the item I got this time. Guild option level +4.”
 </p>
 <p>
  – Oh! So it’s an item that increases the guild’s options!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Where the hell is that item?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Lol, he probably just earned 12 points.
 </p>
 <p>
  – If such an item existed, Gates would spend billions to buy it.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Guild option level +4?
 </p>
 <p>
  – And it increases all the options?
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers, being realistic, doubted the existence of such an item.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah. When I take out this item, the guild will burn… Ah. This is how it’s done. Shall we take a look?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead of physically taking out the Phoenix Flag, Seong Jihan changed the item description in his inventory to public, showing the specs directly in the stream.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Phoenix Flag (Grade: SSS)]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The flag used by the first Khan of the Wind Empire, a descendant of the Phoenix.
 </p>
 <p>
  ……
 </p>
 <p>
  [Additional Effect: If the user is a guild owner or guild master, it increases all the guild option levels by +4.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Due to a system error last time, I received a pretty good reward.”
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wow
 </p>
 <p>
  – Insaneㅋㅋㅋㅋ
 </p>
 <p>
  – Isn’t that the flag? The one everyone was accusing of being manipulated?
 </p>
 <p>
  – It’s the Phoenix you $&amp;#%.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Sir~^^ Do you by any chance know any cheat codes for this game~?^^;
 </p>
 <p>
  – Share the good stuff with us!
 </p>
 <p>
  Once the item’s options were revealed, the dormant heavy sponsorships started pouring in again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ba-ba-ba-ba-bam!
 </p>
 <p>
  [R.E.Gates has donated 100,000GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Player Seong! Please sell that item to us at AF! We’ll buy it for 1 billion dollars!]
 </p>
 <p>
  As usual, Gates generously donated 100,000 GP.
 </p>
 <p>
  He offered a whopping 1 billion dollars, equivalent to 1 trillion KRW.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wow, lol. Gates popped right up. LOL
 </p>
 <p>
  – Who was talking about 1billion earlier? Wasn’t me, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  – He’s offering a trillion LOL. Last time, Gates proposed 300 billion to Seong Jihan as a contract fee.
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  – The item is more expensive than the owner!!!!
 </p>
 <p>
  The chat went wild with Gates’s appearance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ba-ba-ba-bam!
 </p>
 <p>
  [長思聰 has donated 100,000GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The People’s Association will buy the Phoenix Flag for 2 billion dollars. Player Seong Jihan, we expect a wise decision from you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The competition heated up even more with the arrival of a competitor.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wow, the People’s Association jumped in?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Immediately doubling the offer, see?
 </p>
 <p>
  – How do you read that Chinese character?
 </p>
 <p>
  – It’s Jang Sisong. He’s one of the top administrators of the People’s Association… They also watched the broadcast.
 </p>
 <p>
  [R.E.Gates donated 100,000GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [My apologies, Player Seong. It seems I underestimated the value of the Phoenix Flag. I’ll buy it for 3 billion dollars. Please sell it!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [長思聰 donated 100,000GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Then we’ll buy it for 4 billion dollars. Additionally, we promise to pay at least 1 billion dollars more than AF.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the bidding war between the US and Chinese guilds began on the guild channel,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan waved them off with a determined face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I won’t sell it, even if you offer hundreds of billions of dollars. So, please stop the donations.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But… Boss, why decline the donations?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s alright, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Yes, it’s alright.”
 </p>
 <p>
  – Whoa! A Boss who refuses donations?
 </p>
 <p>
  – And in chunks of 100 million each, LOL!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Look at Hayeon’s expression… She looks more regretful.
 </p>
 <p>
  – I’d feel the same, LOL. Missing out on making foreign currency LOL. The 100 million donation battle between the US and China guilds.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was now very wealthy and didn’t need to worry about money.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So… back to our main topic. Our guild is fully invested in growth rate. We shouldn’t forget our main goal as a nurturing guild.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After closing the Phoenix Flag item description, Seong Jihan opened the guild point window and added +2 to the growth rate.
 </p>
 <p>
  Growth Rate Increase (+170%) – LV.17
 </p>
 <p>
  An immense growth rate boost, fitting the original concept.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan showcased this again, lightly promoting,
 </p>
 <p>
  “As you can see, due to the additional effect of the Phoenix Flag, we can now accept 20 more guild members. The growth rate increase effect has improved, so many guild members are seeing stat increase effects…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you’re interested, please contact our guild anytime! I’ll answer with all sincerity!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Following Seong Jihan, Lee Hayeon energetically exclaimed.
 </p>
 <p>
  It would’ve been the perfect end to the broadcast, but then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, about the national representative issue,”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan dropped another bombshell.
 </p>
 <p>
  – I knew it was coming.
 </p>
 <p>
  – The Phoenix Flag distracted us, LOL.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Literally a crazy item.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve seen the public petition to select me, a Gold player, as a national representative. I appreciate the enthusiasm and thought it wasn’t the right time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  – I knew he wouldn’t.
 </p>
 <p>
  – He’ll reach Diamond soon anyway.
 </p>
 <p>
  – It’s a shame, Jihan ㅠㅠ
 </p>
 <p>
  – If he participates now, he’ll only get criticized. No reason for Jihan to step up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Given Jihan’s comment about timing, the viewers mostly agreed.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’d be better to rightfully get selected as a Diamond player next year than face criticism now as a Gold player.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om
 </p>
 <p>
  No one knew.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of Seong Jihan’s desire for achievement points.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But… it was before watching the Taiwan match.”
 </p>
 <p>
  – What…?
 </p>
 <p>
  – There’s something off about the vibe, isn’t there?
 </p>
 <p>
  “But seeing it made me realize,”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a sly smile, Seong Jihan pointed at himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s no warrior in the current national team stronger than me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, Seong Jihan stated,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just arrange a match for me with the national team warriors.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He taunted the entire national representative team, saying,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll prove myself right away.”
 </p>
 <p>
  And he concluded his ‘modest’ appeal with,
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s my stance regarding the national team.”
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wow LOL.
 </p>
 <p>
  – That confidence is insane LOL.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Never imagined he’d say that LOL.
 </p>
 <p>
  – He’s challenging them all ㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷ- Jihan gave them 3 seconds… National team warriors… Rush to the Han River bridge… If you’re even a second late… you’ll get thrashed…
 </p>
 <p>
  And that day’s broadcast made headlines on every portal site.

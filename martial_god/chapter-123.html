   Chapter 123
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  [“National Representatives Warriors, all come out!” Seong Jihan’s public declaration!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Experts on Seong Jihan’s statement, “Impossible.” is overwhelming… “He can beat some of them.” Minority opinion.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Public petition surpasses 500,000 after Seong Jihan’s broadcast?! Petition demanding a confrontation newly established, surpassing 300,000]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Anonymous National Representative Warrior, “Not worth responding.” Shows displeasure]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Even a Gold ranker looks down on the National Representatives… What is the direction for improvement?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s provocation was very successful.
 </p>
 <p>
  The news section of the portal site, which was full of articles related to the defeat in Taiwan, was completely turned over by Seong Jihan’s issue.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wow, a Gold Rank is so arrogant. No matter what, how can he say he can beat the national representatives?
 </p>
 <p>
  – The national reps are just that badㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ If it’s annoying, they should just fight one round, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  – For real, just teach the Gold a lesson, it will be fine. Why are they avoiding?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Because they are scaredㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
 </p>
 <p>
  – Honestly, I can think of a few people who would lose, agree?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Excluding Kim Dongwoo, all will loseㅋ
 </p>
 <p>
  – Welcome, Kim Dongwoo
 </p>
 <p>
  – Even Kim Dongwoo was really bad in Taiwanㅋㅋㅋ Jihan will KO him in one second.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  The leader of the National Representative Warriors, Kim Dongwoo, threw his tablet PC while reading the article comments.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Those crazy bastards… Are they saying I would lose to a Gold Rank now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  He knows he’s strong.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having watched the Top 100 matches, as a Warrior class, he even admired how he could do such a thing.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, being strong is one thing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This guy… He’s going to be a national representative soon anyway. How can he disrespect the seniors like this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  How can he say that?
 </p>
 <p>
  When he becomes a national representative, he will be on the same side, sharing the same fate, so how can he outright insult the seniors like this?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This can’t go on like this.’
 </p>
 <p>
  At first, the way the National Representative Warriors decided to respond to this issue was to ignore it, saying it was not worth answering.
 </p>
 <p>
  But seeing how public opinion is turning, if this goes on, they might end up being ridiculed as national representatives scared of a Gold Rank.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Dongwoo entered the National Representative Warriors’ exclusive chat room.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Guys… This can’t go on like this. If we keep ignoring, it looks like we’ll get a lot of hate comments.
 </p>
 <p>
  – See, I told you. Ignoring will only make us look bad, right? That arrogant guy needs to be taught a lesson
 </p>
 <p>
  – Yes, if this goes on, it’s going to be bad. We need to ask the management for a spot soon.
 </p>
 <p>
  – But bro… We won’t lose, right? That guy is strong
 </p>
 <p>
  – ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Jaeho is crazy, a national representative scared of a Gold Rank?
 </p>
 <p>
  Then a video was uploaded in the chat room.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a highlight video of Seong Jihan clearing the ‘Lone Bridge’ map.
 </p>
 <p>
  – I was so annoyed, I went to the channel to see how strong Gold is… but he’s kinda crazyㄷㄷ;
 </p>
 <p>
  “This dumbass is scared of Gold after watching just one video!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Dongwoo played the video while cursing out loud.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who single-handedly defeated Hojo, and while flying swiftly through the sky, brought down the monsters.
 </p>
 <p>
  After watching the scene where the Warrior dominated the defense game alone,
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Dongwoo opened his mouth wide.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  He’s… kind of strong?
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Dongwoo recalled the Sword King, who has now gone to Japan, from Seong Jihan’s video.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sword King Yoon Sejin, who would single-handedly disrupt the game in BattleNet, a sophisticated team game for national representatives.
 </p>
 <p>
  This guy, like Sword King, showed potential to be an unconventional player.
 </p>
 <p>
  – He’s really strong, damn.
 </p>

   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  – That must be a cheat. Does it make sense for a Warrior to act like that? He’s not even Sword King.
 </p>
 <p>
  – To be honest, Seong Jihan is strong. It’s better to face him as soon as possible. That guy levels up really fast too.
 </p>
 <p>
  – You think it’s better to face him at level 70? Is that something a national representative should say?
 </p>
 <p>
  – You idiot, do you want to lose to a Gold Rank?
 </p>
 <p>
  A chatroom for national representative warriors erupted in debate after watching Seong Jihan’s highlight video.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Dongwoo frowned and quickly sent a message.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Let’s face him soon. If he grows more, even I won’t be able to defeat him.
 </p>
 <p>
  While he was frustrated, his judgment remained calm.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having risen to the leader of the Warrior squad through skill, Kim Dongwoo got chills watching Seong Jihan’s power.
 </p>
 <p>
  He wasn’t sure if he could confidently win against him now. But if they delayed and that guy leveled up even more? They were bound to lose.
 </p>
 <p>
  – If Dong-woo says so… Okay.
 </p>
 <p>
  – I’ll call the Management Department. You guys get ready too.
 </p>
 <p>
  After seeing Seong Jihan’s highlight, the composed Kim Dongwoo called the Management Department immediately.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s Kim Dongwoo. I have something to discuss regarding Seong Jihan’s video…”
 </p>
 <p>
  His request was to arrange a match as soon as possible.
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  Tokyo, at Ito Shizuru’s mansion.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s some interesting news from Korea.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ito Shizuru looked at the news with an intrigued expression. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m
 </p>
 <p>
  The widespread provocation by Seong Jihan, a Gold player, was not only a hot topic in Korea but also drew a lot of attention on Japanese portal sites.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Did something go wrong in Seong Jihan’s brain? A Gold player provoking the national representatives?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Haven’t you seen the Top 100? Seong Jihan is strong.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Maybe the Korean team is just pathetic lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  – What’s Shizuru doing? Hurry up and charm him lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Tsk! I don’t know why such an article is being posted in Japan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sword King, who was lying next to Shizuru, looked displeased.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing Shizuru getting interested in the articles of his former brother-in-law was irritating.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What does Ryuhei think? Will Seong Jihan beat the national warrior representatives?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He will win.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sword King immediately responded. Dislike is one thing, but his power analysis was impartial.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The national team warriors in Korea are pitiful. They’re talentless and lazy. They will all lose to that guy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s the first time I’ve heard you speak well of Seong Jihan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Regardless of my personal feelings, his skills are outstanding. I understand why you’re interested.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s good to hear. So, if Seong Jihan becomes a national representative and faces our country, you… can you overpower him?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hah! What a ridiculous question.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sword King looked annoyed, as if asking if he could overpower someone was offensive.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I could sever his arms and legs in 10 seconds. Just thinking of him getting your attention makes me want to do that right now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Although he originally had no special feelings for Seong Jihan, who was his former brother-in-law, ever since Shizuru, whom he dearly loved, showed interest in him, Seong Jihan became the most despised existence for Sword King.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehe. We’ll see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Shizuru clapped, a woman in a dark uniform emerged from outside the bedroom.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her figure was similar to Akari, who had caused a stir in Korea before.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ninja resembled Shizuru, a beauty of a pale complexion.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you call for me, main body?”
 </p>
 <p>
  She was an ‘avatar’ that Ito Shizuru had made by modifying the returned Akari.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why did you call her?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The match with Korea… Is it next month?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Maybe. I think so.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please take my clone to the national team match then. If you completely suppress Seong Jihan, she’ll likely enchant him properly this time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You still have feelings for him?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. I want to make Japan not just the number one in the Northeast Asia League but the number one in the World League.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Shizuru turned on the TV with a charming smile and switched it to channel 0.
 </p>
 <p>
  There, a highlight of a past Top 100 match was being commented on by American commentators.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I want to hear Japanese, not English, on that channel. I’d also prefer the GP exchange to be shown in yen, not dollars.”

 <p>
  “You’re quite the patriot.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t that why I’m with you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “All I need is you…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry!”
 </p>
 <p>
  To the Sword King, who was hesitant out of jealousy,
 </p>
 <p>
  Shizuru offered a solution.
 </p>
 <p>
  “To ease your concerns… if I enchant Seong Jihan and bring him to Japan, I’ll completely turn him into a woman.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What? Turn him into a woman?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. You weren’t jealous of Akari, were you? Let’s have him undergo a sex change surgery.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sword King was momentarily speechless at Shizuru’s suggestion to change Seong Jihan’s gender.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Heh… fine.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He soon smiled contentedly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The fact that Shizuru had thought of gender change for his sake was pleasing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, I should hope he becomes a national representative soon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, and I’m also working on stirring up public opinion in Korea.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I hope it works out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sword King sincerely hoped that the arrogant former brother-in-law would become a national representative.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  [Mr. Seong Jihan, Mr. Kim Dongwoo, the leader of the national representative candidates, has proposed a match. He is preparing a stage to prove your skills. Would you like to participate…?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I will.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, upon receiving the call, agreed even before Manager Park Yoonsik finished his sentence.
 </p>
 <p>
  [We will proceed with the test at the Management Department’s mock battleground in two days. Ah, and Mr. Kim Dongwoo suggested broadcasting this test live. What do you think about that?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Live broadcast?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if he wins, it’s nothing big. If he loses, it’d be embarrassing to lose as a Diamond Rank to a Gold Rank player. And they want to broadcast it live?
 </p>
 <p>
  [They suggest broadcasting it live through the Management Department’s channel and splitting the profits from the broadcast.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I understand.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Though it seemed more like an attempt to publicly humiliate him, Seong Jihan graciously accepted the Management Department’s proposal.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow, uncle… You’re going up against a national representative?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, sooner than I thought.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps the rumors that the national representatives were afraid of a Gold Rank and avoiding a match had been bothersome, as the test date was set surprisingly quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Wouldn’t it be better to level up a bit more before that? Two days seem too short.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s okay. I can win now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Still! Isn’t it a bit much to face him at level 70?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No. I’m now at 72. And…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan smiled confidently.
 </p>
 <p>
  “My Martial Power stat has reached 100.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…You’ve reached 100? Already? Is that even possible?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I did get some benefits from my title.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Strength 100, a result of combined title and guild bonuses.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Now, I can unify the three Dantians.’
 </p>
 <p>
  From 99 to 100.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although it’s just one stat point difference, reaching a three-digit stat is not merely symbolic.
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to 99, the increased strength was palpably stronger.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This time…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The unification of the three Dantians.
 </p>
 <p>
  I can definitely succeed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah, I think I need to train in the training room.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… To prepare for the test? Okay!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, not for them. It’s for the stat.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan then asked Yoon Seah,
 </p>
 <p>
  “So even if I don’t come out of the training room, don’t worry.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, I’ll finish quickly and be back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, Seong Jihan entered the training room with a bright smile.

   Chapter 124
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  In the training room.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Would you like to attempt the Unification of the Three Dantians?]
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan tried to unify the Three Dantians, a system message spontaneously appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed that his level had significantly improved.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike the last time, there wasn’t any warning message stating, ‘Attempting this unification with your current level poses a significant danger. It could harm your life.’
 </p>
 <p>
  “Unify.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With those words from Seong Jihan, he began to dismantle the boundaries between the Three Dantians.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This time, it will work.’
 </p>
 <p>
  This wasn’t a vague self-confidence.
 </p>
 <p>
  The pre-conditions had been different this time around.
 </p>
 <p>
  The faint borders between the Upper and Middle Dantians had blurred due to using both simultaneously, which gave him a sense of assurance.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Attempting the Unification of the Three Dantians…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan closed his eyes and began to break the walls earnestly. Unifying the half-dissolved Upper and Middle Dantians was easy.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ve already accomplished this part.’
 </p>
 <p>
  His focused energy began to resonate between the two Dantians, and soon, the boundaries vanished.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Two Dantians above have become almost one… but the Lower Dantian is the problem.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The connection with the Lower Dantian was admittedly weak. While Martial Power and Force shared the same stats, the wall of the Lower Dantian remained substantial.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to stimulate it both from inside and outside.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the Lower Dantian, he moved his inner energy to break down the walls.
 </p>
 <p>
  From the outside, he used Force to stimulate it.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he attempted to shatter the vessel containing his inner energy, a tremendous pain surged from his lower abdomen.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It feels like when I faced the flames of Behemoth.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who had faced numerous trials in his past life, relentlessly continued breaking the barriers of the Dantian.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sweat drenched his body.
 </p>
 <p>
  At times, his body felt cold as ice, while at others, it burned with heat.
 </p>
 <p>
  His face flushed, then paled in a repeated cycle.
 </p>
 <p>
  The unification of the Lower Dantian was undeniably challenging.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But…’
 </p>
 <p>
  A reward for his continuous effort appeared as cracks began to form on the walls of the Lower Dantian.
 </p>
 <p>
  Faster than Seong Jihan had anticipated, he calmly continued the unification process.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  After a long and exhausting day…
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s… done…”
 </p>
 <p>
  All boundaries had collapsed, and the unification of the Three Dantians was complete.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, instead of energy gathering in the confined space of the Dantians, Seong Jihan’s entire being encompassed the energy of the Three Dantians.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huff…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Taking a deep breath, Seong Jihan opened his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  He could feel the energy surging throughout his body with every breath.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Worth every moment of the effort.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Satisfied, Seong Jihan was about to leave the training room when…
 </p>
 <p>
  [Attempting the unification of the Three Dantians…]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite having completed the unification, the system message remained unchanged.
 </p>
 <p>
  He halted in his tracks.
 </p>
 <p>
  Why was it still the same after the unification?
 </p>
 <p>
  He opened his status window.
 </p>
 <p>
  Martial Power and Force both remained at 100, unchanged.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Is this not the end?’
 </p>
 <p>
  An error in the system was unlikely.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pondering deeply, Seong Jihan wondered what was missing since all barriers were already broken.
 </p>
 <p>
  After standing idly for a moment in thought, Seong Jihan’s mind ventured to Force’s Absolute Domain.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Do I need to complete the domain to finally finish the unification?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan unfolded the Absolute Domain he had once retracted.
 </p>
 <p>
  With this, only the upper half of his body, specifically above the heart, was involved in the flow of the Absolute Domain.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  ‘Even the Absolute Domain must be fully embodied, and all the Dantians must be able to handle it. Only then it will be true unity.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Having found a clue, Seong Jihan focused on linking the combined Dantian with the Absolute Domain.
 </p>
 <p>
  This, of course, wasn’t easy.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Just understanding the problem, I’ve already solved half of it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If not for the system message, he would have thought that the Three Dantians had unified.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, while pondering how to connect the entire unified Dantians and the space completely dominated by the Absolute Domain,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s merge that into the Dantian as well.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He decided to further advance the Dantian that was limited inside his body.
 </p>
 <p>
  He decided to expand the scope of the Dantian, moving away from the previous method that dominated space through Force.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s tough…’
 </p>
 <p>
  This process was much more challenging than the unification of the Three Dantians.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Three Dantians were inside the body, but this was about unifying external space with the Dantian.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If it wasn’t for my past experiences, I wouldn’t have even tried.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If he hadn’t experienced controlling the Absolute Domain with Force, he would’ve ended up only imagining it.
 </p>
 <p>
  He utilized all his previous experiences and pioneered a new path.
 </p>
 <p>
  Another day passed by like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Is this the limit at this level?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan felt that the entire Dantian had expanded slightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  It felt as if he was wearing a full-body armor named ‘Dantian’.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, compared to the Absolute Domain of the Force, its range had drastically reduced to about 10cm.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This can truly be called the Absolute Domain.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Absolute Domain dominated by the Force wasn’t ‘absolute’ compared to this.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dantian, which expanded its territory even outside, was apt to say that it dominated space.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have completed the unification of the Three Dantians.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Martial Power and Force are unified and reorganized into a new stat…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Obtained a Star’s Ability, Martial Soul]
 </p>
 <p>
  Star’s Ability?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is the star rank above unique?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the reorganized stat, Martial Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  The value was the same as Martial Power or Force, 100.
 </p>
 <p>
  But since the two were combined under the category of Martial Soul, the area of Absolute Domain had doubled from 10cm.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is overwhelmingly powerful…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Star’s Ability called Martial Soul wasn’t just about simply doubling the Absolute Domain area but amplified the Martial Power and Force several times.
 </p>
 <p>
  An ability that even Seong Jihan, who had overwhelmingly conquered the league, found thrilling.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘With this, I can definitely use the third technique.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought of the third advanced technique of the Nameless Divine Arts.
 </p>
 <p>
  With Martial Soul, he could definitely use this martial art.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I might use it in the upcoming national representative battle…’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan anticipated how to use his newfound power,
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, a system message appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Star’s Ability is a power that only a single being from one star can possess.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘The Wandering Martial God’ already possesses Martial Soul.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Star’s Ability, Martial Soul, which only one being from a star can have, is possessed by the Wandering Martial God?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Does this mean… the Wandering Martial God is from Earth?’
 </p>
 <p>
  He had heard that the Wandering Martial God, unlike other Constellations tied to their maternal stars, stayed in the star he created, ‘Tuseong’, and hunted other Constellations.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels
 </p>
 <p>
  Based on the current system message, it was speculated that the Martial God was from Earth.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What happens now?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Since the Martial God had Martial Soul first, does that mean he can’t possess the Star’s Ability?
 </p>
 <p>
  As he pondered this,
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘The Wandering Martial God’ summons you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Before Seong Jihan’s eyes, a pitch-black space opened.
 </p>
 <p>
  In an instant, his body was sucked into it.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  A desolate land shrouded in darkness.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swooosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The space swirled, and a new form of Seong Jihan emerged from it.
 </p>
 <p>
  He first checked his condition.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  ‘My body’s fine.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering he was forcibly taken by an irresistible force, he was unharmed.
 </p>
 <p>
  His abilities, reformed without a soul, remained intact.
 </p>
 <p>
  He looked around.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was dark everywhere, but above, faint lights of various colors shone down.
 </p>
 <p>
  When he looked up, he saw.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Weapons….’
 </p>
 <p>
  Various weapons floated above in the dark space.
 </p>
 <p>
  They seemed randomly placed.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Jihan could quickly discern that each one was of extraordinary caliber.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Those must be at least EX-grade.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Phoenix Spear he had recently acquired couldn’t even compare; the energy emitted by these weapons was of a different class.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was astonishing that such impressive weapons were left unattended.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lost in the array of floating weapons, Jihan couldn’t help but admire.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nice to meet you, young one.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thump! Thump!
 </p>
 <p>
  From the darkness, a figure approached.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You are…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I am Dongbangsak.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A kind-faced old man with white hair, wearing a long blue robe, spoke while stroking his beard.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the language he spoke wasn’t Korean, Jihan instinctively understood.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Dongbangsak…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dongbangsak who lived through the three thousand worlds.
 </p>
 <p>
  That name had special meaning to him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You obtained martial Power through my brush.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Through Dongbangsak’s brush, Jihan was able to overwrite his status window.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, I did.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s why I was chosen as the representative to converse with you on behalf of the Martial God.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Representing the Martial God…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You should ideally meet him in person…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbangsak glanced Jihan up and down while stroking his beard.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even though you possess the Martial Soul, your level is still too low. At your current level, you would perish just by making eye contact with a Martial God.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Wandering Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  Death just from eye contact? Was he some cursed being?
 </p>
 <p>
  Jihan tilted his head and asked, “Why was I summoned?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “To give you a choice,” Dongbangsak leaned back, speaking slowly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Will you accept the Martial Soul, ready for an uncertain death, or will you surrender it cleanly and accept the Martial God’s reward?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Accepting the Martial Soul means being prepared to die?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is it because only a single being from one star can possess it?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Jihan immediately asked Dongbangsak, who was being polite, “Why must one die when they obtain the Martial Soul?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Only one being can possess the Martial Soul. You might coexist with the Martial God for a while if you don’t give it up, but…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbangsak straightened up and stroked his beard again.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sooner or later, coexistence will become impossible. When your level rises significantly, the system will inevitably pit you against the Martial God. And when that day comes, you will die.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a definitive statement that defeating the Wandering Martial God was impossible.
 </p>
 <p>
  He pointed to the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you forsake the predetermined death and surrender the Martial Soul… the Martial God will bestow one of those items upon you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That is…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s the essence of a Constellation. Those weapons positioned in the sky as Constellations actually belong to quite high-ranking Constellations. They belong to Constellations of at least level 1,000. Since you are my disciple, I’ll let you pick a good one.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbangsak, certain that Jihan would surrender, meticulously examined the floating weapons, contemplating which was best.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s not suitable for humans… Ah, that’s the 77-foot mace, but you can’t fully harness its power. That one is too small…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbangsak scrutinized them as if choosing for himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  To resolve his contemplation, Jihan spoke up, “Sir Dongbangsak, you don’t need to pick a weapon for me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hm? What do you mean?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I want to keep the Martial Soul.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At those words, all of Dongbangsak’s actions halted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Are you out of your mind?”
 </p>
 <p>

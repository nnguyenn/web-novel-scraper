  <strong>
   Chapter 125
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why are you so keen on giving up on life? You should change your choice.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbangsak spoke with a face showing he didn’t understand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Look there. At the numerous weapons in the sky. Those are all remnants of Constellations that were defeated by the Martial God. Constellations that boasted of being the masters of stars and were confident in their own strength, all were suppressed by the Martial God.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, I see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…But even if you have obtained the Martial Soul, do you think you can defeat the Martial God? It’s impossible. If you waste the power of the Martial Soul in vain, you will end up just like them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  There was sincerity in Dongbangsak’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  A Martial God who roams and hunts the Constellations.
 </p>
 <p>
  How could a mere human defeat him?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you so obsessed with martial arts that you would reject all of this just to obtain the Martial Soul?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not quite like that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Martial Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was indeed a tempting power.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, as Dongbangsak said, he had no desire to obtain it while antagonizing the invincible Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  After all, Seong Jihan’s goal was not the perfection of martial arts, but to ensure that the Earth remains in the Space League and prevent the extinction of humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, you choose the harder path even when there’s an easier one?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not that either. It’s just…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked around.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Contrary to what you say, Dongbangsak, the master of this star doesn’t think that way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What? What do you mean? I was told otherwise by the Martial God…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This place, it’s called Tuseong, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, it is.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t this a star created by the Martial God using his Martial Soul?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbangsak looked at Seong Jihan with a surprised face for a moment, then slowly nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Indeed, it is.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A star, Tuseong, which originally didn’t exist in the universe, was artificially created by the Martial God’s Martial Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering that Seong Jihan’s Martial Soul has an influence of only 20cm, it was clear how powerful the Martial God’s strength was.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How did you know that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I just felt it. When our Martial Soul Domains overlapped, I sensed it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking at Seong Jihan, who answered so easily, Dongbangsak stroked his beard.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just like that… Heh, as a martial artist, I’m intrigued by your words. Sensing… Such senses are indeed innate. It’s something one can’t achieve through mere effort.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When did he ever painfully feel such a difference?
 </p>
 <p>
  There was genuine envy in Dongbangsak’s voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  “And in the overlapped Martial Soul Domain, I heard the Martial God’s will.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Dongbangsak offered the choice,
 </p>
 <p>
  At the same time, Seong Jihan heard the Martial God’s intention through the Martial Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you wish to defeat me, I’ll gladly wait.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Contrary to what Dongbangsak said, the Martial God actually wanted Seong Jihan to possess the Martial Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  And if he chose to give up the Martial Soul and chose the essence of a Constellation…
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you want to live, you will forever be my servant.]
 </p>
 <p>
  He was told that he would be bound to him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s better to oppose the Martial God than to become his servant.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God’s intention was sincere.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if Seong Jihan obtained the Martial Soul, the Martial God publicly promised to wait until Seong Jihan grew strong enough.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, the answer was obvious.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Even if I die after being defeated later, I’ll live my life.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, to freely maneuver in the upcoming Space League, he absolutely shouldn’t be tied to the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If I accept your offer, I was informed I’d become his eternal servant, just like you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon hearing that, Dongbangsak paused in stroking his beard.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoooosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  He stroked his beard again.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not bad to live as a servant, depending on who the master is.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t want to live a life that’s forever subordinate.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “‘Forever’ is what’s important. Longevity is what any being with a life wishes for. Those who haven’t lived long always think that immortality will eventually lead to unhappiness.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Once you experience it, you’ll know. How blissful an eternal life can be.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Weren’t you mortal before you became a servant of the Martial God?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bearer of Endless Wisdom, Dongbangsak.
 </p>
 <p>
  He wasn’t originally immortal.
 </p>

 <p>
  Did he gain infinite life after becoming a servant of the Martial God?
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s question, Dongbangsak nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right. My martial arts skills could suppress aging to some extent, but I wasn’t completely immortal.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How did you meet the martial God?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You seem to be quite curious.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Snap!
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbangsak plucked a strand of his beard.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, from the plucked beard, smoke arose, and it soon transformed into the shape of a sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  “When you become my successor, I’ll answer your questions.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I doubt that will happen.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, I quite like the idea of you as my successor. I can’t stand by and watch you die in vain.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whooosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  A mirage rose from Dongbangsak’s sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  It soon formed the symbol of yin-yang.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That is…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The god gives me quite a lot of vacations. On my most recent break, I went to visit my hometown and found joy in drawing patterns on the mountain.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Patterns, drawing?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The yin-yang drawn by the sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  The intricate movement created by the black and white entwining.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbangsak merely described it as drawing patterns.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. But kids who saw these patterns kept asking to be my disciples. I played ‘leader’ with them for a while.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Playing ‘leader’…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the movement of the yin-yang, Seong Jihan asked with a name that suddenly came to mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Was your name Jang Sambong then?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh. How did you know?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The place where you played ‘leader’ was Mount Mudang, wasn’t it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s correct. It’s easier to converse when our cultures overlap. I’d like to take you in as my successor even more.”nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbangsak looked at Seong Jihan with sparkling eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Here’s a small trick I came up with during that break.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He started to slowly spin the yin-yang.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you can’t overcome this, challenging the god is futile.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The circle started to spin.
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, the pressure on Seong Jihan intensified.
 </p>
 <p>
  The yin-yang unfolded by Dongbangsak’s sword seemed to be the pinnacle of martial arts.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rumble!
 </p>
 <p>
  [Let him go.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the ground shook and the voice of the absolute being echoed, the yin-yang’s movement stopped abruptly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbangsak dropped the sword, knelt down, and prayed looking at the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I will heed your command, my lord.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “When I see someone who’s at the level of Jang Sambong acting like this, I don’t want to become a servant even more.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jang Sambong? What’s so significant about that? The vacation before the last one, I was called Heavenly Demon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was at a loss for words.
 </p>
 <p>
  Wasn’t that saying he single-handedly defeated the top martial arts experts from both righteous and evil factions in martial arts novels?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anyway, what a pity.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbangsak spoke, swinging his left hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  As his robe fluttered, the world split in two.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, the pitch-black space that originally sent him here appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Tell me anytime if you change your mind.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll remember the good intentions.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan responded dryly to Dongbangsak, overflowing with regret, and took a step.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Returning to the original world.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon after, a system message appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah paced anxiously outside the training room door.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Ah… what should I do?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who went in saying he would finish training soon, has already been inside for two days and the time for the test is almost up, he showed no signs of coming out.
 </p>
 <p>
  The vehicle sent by the Management Department has been waiting in the parking lot below Sword Palace for over an hour.
 </p>
 <p>
  Furthermore, there was only 30 minutes left for the test with the national representative Warriors.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Ugh… I can’t go into the training room because he said it was important training. Should I just tell them he gave up on the test?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The national representative test wasn’t more important than training… but…
 </p>
 <p>
  The things Seong Jihan had done these past few days weighed on Yoon Seah’s mind.
 </p>

 <p>
  ‘Uncle confidently said he could beat any national representative. Even a live broadcast was approved…’
 </p>
 <p>
  If he suddenly didn’t show up on the day of the match, using training as an excuse, even the popular Seong Jihan might face public ridicule and criticism.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah called out to him softly from outside the training room, but since he wasn’t inside, he couldn’t possibly hear her.
 </p>
 <p>
  All she could do was nervously wait.
 </p>
 <p>
  Buzz! Buzz!
 </p>
 <p>
  Her phone vibrated.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ms. Yoon Seah, has Mr. Seong Jihan not come out yet?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, about that…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Well… there’s less than 15 minutes left. Wouldn’t it be better to just cancel today’s match?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Manager Park Yoonsik, who was waiting below, cautiously asked.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather than having a chaotic broadcast because Seong Jihan didn’t show up, it might be better to cancel in advance.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Even if you come out now and get in the car, it seems a bit late… And he wouldn’t be in condition for the match. Maybe the match should be on another day…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, the thing is… then…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Just when Yoon Seah was about to postpone,
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  The training room door opened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah, let me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Un-Uncle!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as he returned to Earth, Seong Jihan, who had overheard Yoon Seah and Park Yoonsik’s conversation, thought,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If Dongbangsak hadn’t been so clingy, there would have been more time.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Recalling Dongbangsak, who was desperately wanting Seong Jihan to be his successor, he made a sour face.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it weren’t for the Martial God, the test almost went awry today.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If traffic is bad, I’ll go on my own. Take the car slowly to the Management Department.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ah… it’s okay! We can still make it if we hurry.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, running is faster.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan said, heading towards the window.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle?! Where are you going?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m taking the shortest route.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…You do realize this isn’t a game, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking at Seong Jihan who had fully opened the window, Yoon Seah spoke with disbelief.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah, just take the Manager’s car.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan waved his hand and jumped out of the window.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle-!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Nameless Divine Arts, Footwork Technique – Flashing Sky Thunder Steps
 </p>
 <p>
  Before Yoon Seah could rush to the window, Seong Jihan, leaving a trail of white flash, was already soaring far away.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… seriously.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah watched Seong Jihan become a distant dot with a frustrated look.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed he was much faster than when they played the game together last time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though in reality, players are constrained by their abilities, how could he move faster than in-game?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Is it because he’s running at full power?’
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as Yoon Seah got into Park Yoonsik’s car, she turned on the TV using the car’s panel.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, it seems Seong Jihan might be late…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The other players have been waiting since an hour ago.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He said he’s running a bit late due to a training session that started two days ago.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But still, regardless of how important training is, shouldn’t people keep their appointments? Especially when the national team players have been around much longer than player Seong Jihan. This really isn’t polite…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The live broadcast was already criticizing Seong Jihan heavily.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah frowned, “They started broadcasting even before the promised time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you think… maybe he’s feeling pressured by the test?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, there’s no way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No matter how urgent a player’s training is, it’s not common to shut themselves in like in martial arts novels, is it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, such cases are… pretty rare, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah was infuriated by the broadcast.
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the commentators seemed to be attacking Seong Jihan as if he held a grudge.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They’re too much. Do they have a grudge or something?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That commentator is known to be close with player Kim Dongwoo. Maybe that’s why.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… I see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Shouldn’t such biased commentators not be allowed to broadcast?
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as Yoon Seah was thinking this,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait?! Seong Jihan has arrived!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really? I heard his car hadn’t even left yet?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Apparently, he ran here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The surprised voices of the commentators echoed.

  <strong>
   Chapter 126
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Outside the BattleNet Testing Arena.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, that kid isn’t coming. He must be scared.”
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the national representative warriors who was smoking spat on the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, I wanted to teach him a lesson. Such a pity.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jaeho, just moments ago you were saying, ‘What if I lose?’ right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, brother! That was just a comment. How can I lose to someone too scared to show up?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh… But that guy is also something. What does he think he’s doing by calling everyone and then bailing on the day?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Although there were still about ten minutes before the start of the test, the players already believed that Seong Jihan wouldn’t show up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… Thank God.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The player who had spat moments ago, Gu Jaeho, sighed with relief internally.
 </p>
 <p>
  Being the lowest level among the national representative warriors, he had been rumored to be Seong Jihan’s first opponent.
 </p>
 <p>
  Until moments ago, after watching Seong Jihan’s highlights, Jaeho was half-convinced he’d lose.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It was a good idea by Dongwoo to broadcast this, but the level of interest was so high I thought we were doomed…’
 </p>
 <p>
  A Gold-ranked challenging the Diamond-ranked national team?
 </p>
 <p>
  This was an unprecedented event worldwide.
 </p>
 <p>
  Several international media teams were already waiting inside the testing arena, and online, hundreds of millions were eagerly awaiting the live broadcast.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not just Koreans, but a number driven by significant foreign viewership.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jaeho was nervous at the thought of becoming the first sacrificial lamb to lose to a Gold-ranked in front of the entire world.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the absence of Seong Jihan brought a barely concealed smile to his face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha! If Seong Jihan had shown up, I would’ve taken him down in one hit!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jaeho looked genuinely happy as he said this.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just then.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, what’s that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s flying over there?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Players standing opposite Jaeho pointed at the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jaeho turned and blankly stared up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Far away, something was approaching at incredible speed, leaving a white trail.
 </p>
 <p>
  At this velocity, a direct hit could be catastrophic for anyone nearby.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Damn, what is that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey! Dodge it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  But no one thought to move.
 </p>
 <p>
  Would you, with a speeding truck coming right at you?
 </p>
 <p>
  The players stood still, transfixed by the approaching object.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, the ‘thing’ stopped abruptly in mid-air.
 </p>
 <p>
  Realizing its identity, the players dropped their cigarettes in shock.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh… Seong Jihan?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The figure that had rocketed from the sky was none other than Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Witnessing this, the minds of the players went blank for a different reason.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Did he fly from Sword Palace?’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Wasn’t he a Warrior? Can a Gold-ranker even fly like that?’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Am I supposed to fight someone like that?’
 </p>
 <p>
  While the national representative Warriors stood frozen,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hello.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Having landed smoothly, he greeted with a light bow.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t seem to be late. Let’s begin.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, he beckoned his first opponent, Jaeho, and headed into the Management building.
 </p>
 <p>
  Chills ran down Jaeho’s spine.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What… Is he even human?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, Jaeho wasn’t keen on entering the testing arena.
 </p>
 <p>
  The outcome seemed all too clear.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jaeho, what are you doing? Aren’t you going?”
 </p>
 <p>
  But as Seong Jihan’s first opponent, Jaeho couldn’t back out.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m going, brother.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a heavy heart, he entered the testing arena as if being led to slaughter.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Oh no…Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  – Player Jaeho is down in just one move!
 </p>
 <p>
  His ominous feeling had quickly become reality.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  The global spotlight was on the national representative test.
 </p>
 <p>
  Many experts predicted that Seong Jihan would not lose easily.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Considering the amazing performance he has shown so far, he could probably beat a few of the current Korean national team warriors.
 </p>
 <p>
  – But probably not against players above level 225.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Of course. Players at level 225 are on a different level. Unless Seong Jihan has improved even more.
 </p>
 <p>
  – I agree. Honestly, I think if he reaches the Platinum Rank, he might be able to beat one or two players at level 225. But he’s only Gold now, right?
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  – Let’s be clear. There’s a definite limit for a Gold.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how skilled one is, there’s a limit in the ‘fundamental’ level.
 </p>
 <p>
  He will eventually lose to those above level 225.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was the consensus among experts, and most people agreed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then the test match began.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Alright, the game is starting!
 </p>
 <p>
  – This map is a survival map called “Colosseum”, modified by the management bureau.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Seong Jihan isn’t using a connector, so the game will proceed through an invite from the management bureau.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Such a unique player. He doesn’t even use the BattleNet connector.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Yes. Some fans say it doesn’t matter since he won’t get hit anyway…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Haha! How can a player never get hit, especially a front-line warrior! Isn’t that mindset rather irresponsible?
 </p>
 <p>
  – We’ll find out soon enough! The game starts now!
 </p>
 <p>
  Ding!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s first opponent was Gu Jaeho, who had vowed to teach him a lesson.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please take care of me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, yes. Me too…”
 </p>
 <p>
  They both bowed their heads to each other in greeting.
 </p>
 <p>
  After the greeting, Seong Jihan rushed towards Gu Jaeho.
 </p>
 <p>
  And threw a punch.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  Gu Jaeho, who hadn’t fully prepared his defenses, had many vulnerabilities, but Seong Jihan deliberately aimed for the shield.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kuhack!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gu Jaeho, holding an SS-grade shield, couldn’t withstand the blow and was sent flying, shield and all.
 </p>
 <p>
  With just one blow, the match was over.
 </p>
 <p>
  – What…?
 </p>
 <p>
  – It’s, it’s an instant knockout. The game is over…!
 </p>
 <p>
  – It’s already over?
 </p>
 <p>
  While the commentators were confused, chats filled with excitement from viewers poured in.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Gu Jaeho lolololol, was that a one-hit knockout for real?
 </p>
 <p>
  – I knew he’d lose, but didn’t expect him to be blown away like that lololol
 </p>
 <p>
  – Why is he on the national team? He’s not even level 225.
 </p>
 <p>
  – That’s because there are no warriors above that level.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Where did all the national team warriors go? -_-
 </p>
 <p>
  – Seong Jihan is here lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  The dominant reaction was that this outcome was somewhat expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was just surprising that it ended with a single blow.
 </p>
 <p>
  The lower-tier national team Warriors had skills that were embarrassing for their title since they hadn’t reached level 225.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  The one-hit knockouts mercilessly continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Gasp…!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Warrior Lim Jaejin also got knocked out in one hit!
 </p>
 <p>
  – He’s not even using a weapon… Is this even possible?
 </p>
 <p>
  – He sends opponents flying out of the Colosseum map with their shields! The verdict… One-hit Instant knockout!
 </p>
 <p>
  Lim Jaejin, a tank-type warrior close to level 225, was also sent flying with a single punch.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Uh… Seong Jihan’s next opponent is Lee Yoongi, and he still isn’t using a weapon!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Lee Yoongi’s level is over 225, you know? He’s a genuine front-line warrior for the national team… Seong Jihan! You should be careful from now on!
 </p>
 <p>
  Against Lee Yoon-Gi, who had surpassed the level 225 barrier and was part of the national team’s ace line, Seong Jihan still did not use a weapon.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not even using a weapon…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Yoongi seemed hurt in his pride and gritted his teeth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Make me use one.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan shrugged.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before the unification of the Three Dantians, he would have had to use a weapon against an opponent like Lee Yoongi.
 </p>
 <p>
  And even with a weapon, he wouldn’t have achieved a one-hit knockout like now.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Martial Soul. As expected, it’s in a league of its own.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Martial Soul, when he truly exerted its power, it was indeed on a different level.
 </p>
 <p>
  The power, which had been divided between Martial Power and Force, was now unified, allowing him to use it freely.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Martial Soul Domain is incomparable to the old Absolute Domain.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the Martial Soul Domain only extended for 20cm, its efficacy was incomparable to the Absolute Domain of the Force.
 </p>
 <p>
  “And if I expand this, I can use it like the old Absolute Domain up to 40m.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed, there was only one being that could obtain the Star’s Ability.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was an ability completely different from the unique stats.
 </p>
 <p>
  “To maintain this ability, I’ll eventually have to fight against the Martial God… but that’s for later.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He had decided not to confront him until he was fully matured, so that would be a long time from now.
 </p>
 <p>
  Right now, he just had to focus on what was in front of him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘As befits the owner of the Martial Soul, it’s overwhelming.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan slowly extended his fist, glaring at Lee Yoongi, who seemed to want to kill him.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a slow movement.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t really an attack, but more like a provocative gesture.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You brat… Are you not taking this seriously?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing that, Lee Yoongi tried to rush at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  But even before his foot could take off the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Yoongi’s body was sent flying backward, his internal organs completely crushed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even with a high-grade shield.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even with a powerful passive skill like a Protective Barrier, it was of no use.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was deemed an instant kill and disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Over level 225, truly representing the national ace line.
 </p>
 <p>
  Was killed instantly by a punch that didn’t even touch him.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wh… What…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Huh…
 </p>
 <p>
  In this unbelievable situation, even the commentators were at a loss for words.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh. Sh*t… What was that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The mood of the national representative warriors, waiting for their turn, also chilled like an ice field.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  – Lee Yoongi is a powerful warrior ranking within the top 7 of the national team just by level! He’s undoubtedly an ace… and yet he was defeated in one hit…!
 </p>
 <p>
  – No. Is this… even possible?! The punch didn’t even touch him?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Did he shoot some kind of wind? But the relay camera didn’t catch anything! The in-game camera is the same as the BattleNet game’s camera, so it should capture almost everything!
 </p>
 <p>
  – This is unbelievable. I can’t understand… How could Lee Yoongi…
 </p>
 <p>
  As the caster energetically described the instant defeat of Lee Yoongi,
 </p>
 <p>
  The analyst seemed to be in denial.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Why is the commentator so biased?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Really, if Seong Jihan does well, isn’t it good for our country in the end?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Exactly, why is he so upset?
 </p>
 <p>
  – If we have such a player, they should be grateful and appreciate him, right? LOL. Is it a personal grudge or something?
 </p>
 <p>
  – NBC commentary, right? Should we go to the NBC board?
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers, listening to the seemingly biased commentary, expressed their frustrations in real-time.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Um…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The caster nudged the analyst, signaling him to look at the monitor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the chat room filled with 50% of the comments berating the analyst, he kept his mouth shut.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This… I can’t favor Dongwoo anymore.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if he had a close relationship with Kim Dongwoo, going against the tide would cause trouble.
 </p>
 <p>
  He just decided to stay silent.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the match continued to be one-sided.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s one-punch dominance continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wow, LOL, he keeps ending it with one punch!
 </p>
 <p>
  – He’s too lazy to even punch now, LOL.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Seong Jihan! Seong Jihan! Seong Jihan! Seong Jihan! Seong Jihan! Seong Jihan! Seong Jihan! Seong Jihan!
 </p>
 <p>
  – I told you, right? I said Jihan would finish in 3 seconds, LOL.
 </p>
 <p>
  – But… seems like he’s even stronger than before?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Getting even stronger, have you no conscience?
 </p>
 <p>
  – The less conscience, the better for us, LOL.
 </p>
 <p>
  – For real, please blow away the Sword King like that too, please ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah. Sh*t. This damn game!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  After being ejected from the BattleNet connector, the second-ranked player from the warrior team couldn’t hold back his anger and kicked the connector.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why is this damn… how can a Gold Rank do that?! Does that make any sense? Ah, seriously. This is unbearable.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The player’s face turned red with rage, and tears even welled up in his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seriously, the Management Department didn’t tamper with the system or something? Editing data to favor that bastard…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You know… that’s impossible.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aaargh! Seriously!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The national team players felt the same way looking at him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hadn’t they all been humiliated by a single punch?
 </p>
 <p>
  Except for one.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Um… Player Kim Dongwoo, will you proceed?”
 </p>
 <p>
  An official from the management bureau cautiously asked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Whew…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Dongwoo took a deep sigh.
 </p>
 <p>
  He didn’t want to do it!
 </p>
 <p>
  The second-ranked player who just exited had a level not too different from his. And seeing how he was defeated with a single hit, Kim Dongwoo presumed his fate would be the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  But still…
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I have to.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Being the team leader, he couldn’t be the only one to back out.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a heavy heart, Kim Dongwoo sat down in the connector.
 </p>
 <p>
  And when Seong Jihan faced him in-game, he thought,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He’s the national team’s warrior leader, I should show some manners.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Although he could have finished it in one hit, he decided to give one more blow.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang! Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  After taking two hits, Kim Dong-woo was sent flying.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah! But Kim Dongwoo! He withstood one hit!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…It seems like he just decided to hit him twice.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With the commentator’s gloomy voice as the last thing heard, that test day became legendary.

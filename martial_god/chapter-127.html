  <strong>
   Chapter 127
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as the test ended with Seong Jihan’s one punch, the interview began.
 </p>
 <p>
  Originally, everyone was supposed to gather for the interview, but due to the national representatives being enveloped in shock and declining the interview, only Seong Jihan stood in front of the camera and the announcer.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Player Seong Jihan! Congratulations on passing the test first of all!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The female announcer gazed at Seong Jihan, her eyes twinkling.
 </p>
 <p>
  Excitement filled her eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “In fact, many experts predicted that today’s test would not be easy. However, you, Player Seong Jihan, have shattered those predictions and shown an overwhelming performance! Even though you’re a Gold ranker, you’ve shown such strong abilities. Is there a secret behind it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I thought until two days ago that I wouldn’t be able to easily beat players above level 225. But perhaps the results of my training these past few days showed, and I was able to produce an unexpected outcome today.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah! I heard that you devote yourself to training except when you’re running BattleNet. The result of such effort showed today!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The announcer highlighted Seong Jihan as if he were the embodiment of effort.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That’s not quite it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather than benefiting from training, it was thanks to his stats.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought the announcer was overdoing it a bit.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the public’s image of him wasn’t quite like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  He gave up billions even when he was getting calls from the United States and created the nurturing type guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though his public recognition was now fully established, compared to other players, he minimized external activities and was a hardcore player who only focused on training.
 </p>
 <p>
  That was the image-making that had been done.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…You showed a really incredible performance today. We look forward to your activities as a national representative in the future!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I just passed the test, selection is up to the Management Department and the coach. I am just satisfied to compete with the national representative-level warriors.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Considering this result, which everyone has watched, could you possibly not be selected? Then, please share a word about your resolution for the future!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “At this level… I can target the Sword King.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Calmly, Seong Jihan, who was confident he could target the world’s No. 1 warrior, said,
 </p>
 <p>
  “And by next year, I’ll take his head.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah. T-take his head?”
 </p>
 <p>
  With an additional remark, the interview concluded.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Lol, look at that confidence.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Damn!!! He even won against the national representative now. He could take the Sword King’s head next year!!!
 </p>
 <p>
  – This Gold ranker is taking the Sword King too lightly^^ Just because he won against our historically weakest national team, he’s getting too haughty~~^^ I wish he gets a reality check in the match against Japan soon!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Dang, is there still a Sword King fan?
 </p>
 <p>
  – How can you continue to be a Sword King fan seeing the current state of our country?
 </p>
 <p>
  – In a way, that’s a true fan right there lol
 </p>
 <p>
  With the talk of taking the Sword King’s head, the chat, including those thought to had disappeared, the Sword King fans, went wild.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, most of the reactions were uniformly welcoming.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering Seong Jihan, who showed an overwhelming abilities even as a Gold ranker, people expected that he could defeat the Sword King as promised next year.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, in Tokyo, Japan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmmm….”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ito Shizuru watched Seong Jihan’s test with a serious face.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though it happened abroad, it was a historic event where a Gold ranker challenged a national representative, so even the Japanese BattleNet specialty channel broadcasted it live.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Suddenly… he became so strong?’
 </p>
 <p>
  He wasn’t like this when he fought with Akari, the Diamond Rank ninja.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Akari was pushed back, she was stronger than him physically.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the spectacle today was totally different.
 </p>
 <p>
  Judging from the clash with the national representative, Seong Jihan’s power went beyond just suppressing his opponent.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This bastard…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sword King, having watched Seong Jihan’s interview as well, bulged his eyes with anger next to her.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ryuhei. What do you think?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A laughable fellow! Saying he’ll take my head next year? I… I’ll kill him right away…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ryuhei. Calmly, please speak rationally.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Shizuru’s voice grew cold, the Sword King bit his lip.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can definitely beat him now. But…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “In a year, you can’t guarantee it. Right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed shameful to give such an answer, and the Sword King’s fist quivered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, since she wanted a rational answer, he had to convey just the facts.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can’t believe his growth rate. It’s only been about a month since he fought that ninja… He’s grown several stages in that short time. At this rate, it might be tough for me next year.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “As expected…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ito Shizuru nodded calmly, seemingly having expected that answer.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the TV screen, Seong Jihan, who had finished the interview, was shown meeting Yoon Seah, who was at the test site.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her gaze followed Yoon Seah, not Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ryuhei. Don’t you want to see your daughter?”
 </p>

 <p>
  “I… just need you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I think it’s time to bring her here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, whom he had ordered to stay in Korea in case the charm on the Sword King wore off.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the situation has changed a lot since then.
 </p>
 <p>
  The charm on the Sword King had now firmly taken hold.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘She also has a unique gift.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah also, while not on the level of Seong Jihan, had quite a unique Gift.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The only thing that could be considered a weakness of Seong Jihan now is her.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if Akari, who had been made into her avatar, was deployed during the national team game, there was no guarantee that Seong Jihan would definitely be enchanted.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, it was necessary to secure his only weakness in preparation for this moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What do you intend to do with Seah?”
 </p>
 <p>
  In response to the Sword King’s question,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m going to raise her like my own daughter.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Shizuru said calmly, looking at Yoon Seah, who wasn’t much younger than her.
 </p>
 <p>
  “In Japan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the elevator of the Sword Palace.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle. It’s breaking news!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aren’t you used to it by now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How rushed was this article? There’s even a typo! It says ‘Sheong Jihan’! They need to correct it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, with a teasing smile, looked at Yoon Seah, who was excitedly leaving comments on her phone.
 </p>
 <p>
  Somehow, she seemed even more excited than him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle. Shall we have a party to celebrate being selected for the national team?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Eh, what party. And I haven’t been selected yet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey! This is basically it! I’ll use my power today. Just rest in your room for a bit!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Saying that, Yoon Seah, unable to take her eyes off her phone, nudged Seong Jihan’s back.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Speaking of which, Ariel is quiet.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel, who had been attached to his arm when he unified the Three Dantians.
 </p>
 <p>
  When summoned by the Wandering Martial God, she was also taken along, so she might tell some stories related to the Constellations.
 </p>
 <p>
  Strangely, she was silent.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan checked his left arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  The shadow energy concentrated around his elbow.
 </p>
 <p>
  The power that had coalesced through the Martial Soul, even after the abilities were reorganized, still showed no sign of activity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thump!
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan touched it,
 </p>
 <p>
  […What, what is it? Why have you sealed me?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel spoke with a surprised voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sealed?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes… Aren’t you sealing me now?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I didn’t intend to, but come out for now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the shadow energy writhed in Seong Jihan’s left arm, unable to move beyond the aggregated range.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Are you teasing me? You ask me to come out after sealing me… That’s too much.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  At that word, Seong Jihan inspected his body.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon after.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The domain reorganized by the Martial Soul cannot be invaded.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The shadow energy, which used to roam freely within him without his consent.
 </p>
 <p>
  But now, because his body was completely reorganized by the Martial Soul, it could not move at will.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I must allow space up to the left arm.’
 </p>
 <p>
  When he widened the path the shadow energy could take, Ariel finally moved.
 </p>
 <p>
  Black smoke sprouted from Seong Jihan’s arm and swiftly transformed into the shape of a shadow elf.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Haa… I thought I was going to die.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She, who seemed to have grown even more,
 </p>
 <p>
  Had grown almost as tall as Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hm? Isn’t this almost like my original body? No, what is this… this amount of magic power?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel, who was looking at her body curiously, widened her eyes, feeling the magic power flowing from Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Energy is constantly flowing from you… What exactly did you do? The Shadow Sword stat was definitely low before.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s the result of training. Didn’t you see it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The combining of mana pools of a lower-class race? About the time the result was about to come out, didn’t you seal me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel said, scanning Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now it can’t even be called a mid-tier race…… Superior. No…… Beyond that? That the lowest tier has come this far…… At this rate, it has surpassed elves and can rival the dragon race.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What tier is the dragon race?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Above superior. I don’t rank anything above that because it’s an unknown territory. A race that rivals dragons or demigods…… And above that, I only know there’s the Constellations.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed, ‘Martial Soul’, a skill representing the stars, had easily exceeded Ariel’s grading criteria in a single leap.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I guess she doesn’t know about the incident at Tuseong.’
 </p>

 <p>
  Originally, he intended to ask questions under the assumption that she followed him there and saw everything.
 </p>
 <p>
  If she saw nothing because she was sealed at the time, there was no need to necessarily tell her everything about what happened at Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan only asked about what she might know.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ariel. Do you know about the servants of the Wandering Martial God?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Servants? Ah…… are you talking about the descendants of the Martial God?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Descendants, is it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It is known that there are a total of five descendants of the Martial God. When they come as emissaries of death, that star will tremble in fear.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do they do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s simple. They ask the Constellations, ‘Will you die alone? Or will you perish along with the star?’.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You know quite a bit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Wandering Martial God is no different from a cosmic disaster. Everyone raises their antennas at his news. But how does the master know about the Martial God’s descendants?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I met him when you were sealed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Without detailing the specific circumstances, and only speaking about Dongbangsak, Ariel nodded her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Cosmic Heavenly Demon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Cosmic Heavenly Demon……?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jang Sambong, also known as the Heavenly Demon.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seems Dongbang Sak himself preferred Heavenly Demon.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. He is a descendant of the Martial God. A little while ago, I told about the question they ask, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The ‘Will you die alone? Or will you perish along with the star?'”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. If the master of a star defies and decides to desperately resist along with the star, the Cosmic Heavenly Demon kidnaps him right there, saying it wants to avoid unnecessary sacrifices.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……Dongbangsak is able to deal with even the master of stars?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He may be overpowered in strength, but it seems the Cosmic Heavenly Demon has a peculiar capture technique.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recalled Dongbangsak forming ying-yang in the Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the Martial God had not sent help then, he would have undoubtedly been trapped in the star.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right…… I see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But how exactly did you meet the Cosmic Heavenly Demon, master?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s complicated.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish! swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan, having heard all the answers he wanted, gestured as if saying that’s enough, Ariel rolled her eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You just pick and choose the answers you want.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s the privilege of being a master.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s go. Go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel left the room.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, Ariel? Why did you grow so much?…… Should I call you ‘sister’ now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No need. If we’re going by age, I’m old enough to be called grandma. Just call me as you always did.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay. Do you want to cook together?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll taste it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  While the two were chatting outside, Seong Jihan checked his changed ability.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Martial Soul is at 100.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial Power and Force combined into Martial Soul, and the status window showed no significant change.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘My Nameless Divine Arts skill……’
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly feeling something, he opened the skill window.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, the skill ‘Nameless Divine Arts’ was surrounded by a golden glow.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Nameless Divine Arts (Grade: SS)]
 </p>
 <p>
  [A skill transmitted only as fragments of the Nameless Divine Arts.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Having acquired ‘Martial Soul’, which is one of the main streams of the Nameless Divine Skill, a reintegration is in progress.
 </p>
 <p>
  *If you modify the three advanced techniques of the Nameless Divine Arts to suit yourself, or find out the name ‘Nameless’, you can fully awaken the Nameless Divine Arts.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do you want to guess the name ‘Nameless’?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The name consists of two characters.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You are given three chances.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The rank has increased.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With considerably changed skill explanations and upgraded rank, using martial arts seemed to be more convenient.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, what caught Seong Jihan’s attention was something else.
 </p>
 <p>
  The system message that popped up at the end.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Guess the name?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Guessing the name seems much easier than modifying the three advanced techniques to suit himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a situation practically without hints, guessing correctly seemed nearly impossible.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Nameless Divine Arts must be the martial arts of the Martial God after all.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, after a moment of contemplation, attempted to guess the name.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the name of the Martial God’s Divine arts was ‘God’ with two characters overlapping, it didn’t seem right.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Martial Soul Divine Arts?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Incorrect.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [2 chances remain.]
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t that.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should save one chance for later.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to test a suspicion he’d had since meeting the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……Jihan Divine Arts?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yes, he tried inserting his own name.

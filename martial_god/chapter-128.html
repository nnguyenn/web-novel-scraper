  <strong>
   Chapter 128
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  There was a reason why Seong Jihan put his own name into consideration.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A Constellation hunting its own kind… The attitude of the Wandering Martial God is so odd.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Back then, when he hit Martial Power 30 and acquired the skill Nameless Divine Arts.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Wandering War God, cautious of him when his unification of Three Dantians was activated, withdrew the Gift and also canceled the transmission of martial arts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even at that time, Jihan just thought that the Martial God was highly wary of him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The response was completely different this time.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though Seong Jihan, whom he was highly cautious, came to Tuseong, the Martial God stopped Dongbangsak and instead showed mercy, encouraging him to gain strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  Wasn’t this reaction so different from the initial one?
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God, who mercilessly hunts down other Constellations by sending ultimatums, was exceptionally generous to him, and he couldn’t understand why.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I… obtained the Martial Soul too easily.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial Soul, a Star’s Abiltiy obtained through the unification of the Three Dantians.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if unifying the Three Dantians was a great achievement, the value of the Martial Soul exceeded it by far.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial Soul possessed immeasurable potential, so much so that even after dismissing the national representative, it could not be said to have fully managed its power.
 </p>
 <p>
  Had he really been that talented in martial arts to earn such ability?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’m not that good…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, in his previous life, he did rise to the position of the strongest among humanity, but obtaining the Martial Soul was an incomparable achievement.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, obtaining the Martial Soul this easily made him think that there must be some connection between the wandering War God and himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  So he tried inserting the name Jihan, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  [Incorrect.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Only the last chance remaining.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hint: It is related to an ancient existence.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Oh, it wasn’t.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan sighed in relief, seeing the hint along with the notification of the wrong answer.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s fortunate that it wasn’t as I feared.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing that it was related to an ancient existence, it seemed that the Martial God was an entity separate from himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll have to modify the three advanced techniques to upgrade the Nameless Divine Arts.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Since the last chance was without much clue, he decided to leave it for now.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to pursue the upgrade in a conventional manner for the time being.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I have somewhat caught the clue for modifying the Divine Thunder Decree.’
 </p>
 <p>
  When it mixed with the flame of the phoenix, the power of thunder, had become much stronger.
 </p>
 <p>
  The direction for modifying the martial arts of the Divine Thunder Decree seemed to be to integrate it with the Phoenix Flame.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There are no clues for the others.’
 </p>
 <p>
  However, he had no idea how to modify the other two advanced techniques.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to start changing the Divine Thunder Decree one at a time to suit himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle~ Come eat!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is it ready already?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. Ariel is good at cooking. With her help, it was finished quickly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay. I’m coming.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She said she’ll tasted it but she cooked too?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan organized his thoughts and left the room with a lighter heart.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Four days had passed since Seong Jihan took the test.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a conference room of the BattleNet Management Department, members of the National Representative Selection Committee gathered.
 </p>
 <p>
  The National Representative Selection Committee was mostly composed of executives from the top 10 guilds in Korea, so they had a certain rapport.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you see the reporters when you came in today?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. There were way more than usual. It seemed to be twice as many as when the list of national representatives was announced in the second half of the year.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Goodness… just because of one player, what a fuss.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That player is none other than Seong Jihan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now, now. Committee members. Please take your seats.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the chairman stepped forward, everyone took their designated seats.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The reason I have called you all here today is to revise the National Representative selection criteria of the Management Department.”
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  “Heh, we have to revise the selection criteria just because of one player…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The public sentiment is not ordinary. It’s been 3 days and they’re making a fuss asking why the selection is not being made yet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The selection of BattleNet National Representatives.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since the rank in the BattleNet League wasn’t just a rank in entertainment, but something on which the future of a country hinged.
 </p>
 <p>
  The representative selection went through as systematic and fair a process as possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, even if Seong Jihan showed an insane performance, it was natural that it took some time.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the public, who saw Seong Jihan’s one-man show, didn’t think so.
 </p>
 <p>
  “My elementary school daughter also scolded me, asking what is daddy doing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehe. My father, who is in a nursing home, called me. He asked if there was any reason not to pick Seong Jihan. Even though I tell him he’ll be picked soon, he forgets because of his dementia and contacts me every day.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Haha… That must be quite troublesome.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I wonder if there’s anyone here who hasn’t received such a question.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After witnessing Seong Jihan’s performance, which blew away all the national-level Warriors in one room, the public opinion, which initially opposed Jihan being a representative because he was a Gold player, completely flipped, sending unanimous support.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially, the prevailing opinion was that Jihan should be put into the game against Russia, which will take place in a week.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay. Then, let’s revise the criteria for selecting the Korean national representatives from Daimond Rank to Gold and above. Is there anyone against it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  In this situation, opposing would be tantamount to becoming a national traitor.
 </p>
 <p>
  No one raised their hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright. So, understanding that everyone agrees… I will revise the national representative selection criteria.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud! Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  The chairman quickly passed the agenda.
 </p>
 <p>
  “And the next agenda is about changing the national representative selection list.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you replacing player Gu Jaeho with player Seong Jihan?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. That’s right. We plan to replace Gu Jaeho, the lowest-ranked Warrior representative, with Seong Jihan. Is there anyone against this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The result is the fairest.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No objections.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gu Jaeho, who was the first to be defeated by Jihan with one punch, inevitably got a taste of falling out of the national representative selection.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s the first time a meeting has ended so quickly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shouldn’t we end the losing streak?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… Can we end the losing streak just by choosing him?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you watch Jihan’s broadcast yesterday? He’s now fighting Hojo with his bare hands. Considering his growth rate, it’s worth expecting.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, do you also watch Jihan’s broadcasts yourself, Chairman?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If I don’t watch them, I can’t join in the conversation with my kids. Hehe.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After the national representative test, Seong Jihan’s channel, which gained subscribers steeply again, surpassed 5 million.
 </p>
 <p>
  In Korea, less than 10 players have surpassed 5 million subscribers, but Jihan had reached this record even as a Gold player.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, I will notify player Seong Jihan that he has been selected as a national representative and request to stay at the BattleNet Center.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He should participate in the game against Russia right away.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… But Jihan has humiliated the national representative warriors so much, can they build teamwork smoothly during the training camp?”
 </p>
 <p>
  A member expressed such concerns, but
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh~ They’re all pros, not kids, what could happen? Don’t worry. Even the national Warrior players will be glad that a strong player is joining.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right. Would they want to be the lowest forever?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Other members spoke dismissively as if that wouldn’t happen.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright. Let’s hold a press conference and wrap up today’s schedule.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, the national representative selection committee meeting ended swiftly.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the news was conveyed to Seong Jihan through Manager Park Yoonsik.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The National Representative Selection Committee revises the selection rules! Now Gold players can also be selected!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Seong Jihan selected as a Battlenet National Representative! Can participate from the next League game against Russia!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle! Congratulations on being selected!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah entered the room to congratulate him after seeing the breaking news, and saw Jihan, who was on the phone with a serious expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do we… have to do the training camp?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes… A training camp is essential for the national representative match. The map chosen for the game against Russia is a Siege map, so a harmonization process is needed even more.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s just that I’m a bit concerned about leaving my niece alone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Oh! Don’t worry about that. Family members can also come to the BattleNet Center. The facilities at the BattleNet Center are above a 5-star hotel, and a suite is provided to each player.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright. When should we come?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The training camp starts in 3 days. I will come to pick you up.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay. See you then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, who listened to the conversation between Jihan and Park Yoonsik, waved her palm left and right.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a gesture of refusal.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Ah. Uncle. What’s with that, I’m not a kid… It’s okay. Why bother taking me to the BattleNet Center?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Something might happen.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come on~ What could happen! Even that stalker has disappeared, hasn’t he?”
 </p>
 <p>
  If the stalker had been alive, it might have been different.
 </p>
 <p>
  Is there anything dangerous now?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is what you call overprotection.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking so, Yoon Seah wore a meaningful smile on her lips.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s so much happening at the BattleNet Center! Scandals among national team-level players are said to originate from there. Wouldn’t Uncle be disappointed if he brought me there and we couldn’t join in?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s not even funny.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They say you have quite a bit of free time after training camp, right? There’s a drinking party every night.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan made a face as if he couldn’t believe what he was hearing.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘League losers and yet so undisciplined, huh.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even considering it’s a tutorial phase, if it’s notorious enough for the general public to know, how much of a mess must their training be?
 </p>
 <p>
  It made him question the point of training camps.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anyway. I’m really fine! Have a good time at the training camp!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What if a madman barges in?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What… How would a madman get all the way up to this penthouse! They can’t even take the elevator!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah didn’t seem inclined to go to the BattleNet Center at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, nothing should happen.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With Xin Youhwa dead, there was no one left to threaten her, but Seong Jihan still wanted to make some insurance arrangements.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where’s Ariel?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “She’s rolling around on the sofa, watching TV.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What a mess.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan went to the living room, Ariel had become one with the sofa.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master. You’re back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ariel. How far can you be from me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Um… not very far in this physical form. But in my smaller form, I can be quite far.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good. Stay in the penthouse while I’m at the training camp, even if you have to reduce your form.”Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om
 </p>
 <p>
  Since the BattleNet Center was located in Gangnam, it was not too far from Sword Palace in terms of distance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even in a small form, leaving Ariel behind would be a relief.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle… Ariel. Isn’t that the black sword? The Shadow something?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t need it for practice anyway.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s mean. Master. Saying it’s not needed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel verbally protested, but with a leisurely face, she continued watching TV.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crunch!
 </p>
 <p>
  Using her shadow, she enjoyed a piece of heaven, eating potato chips placed on the coffee table in front of the sofa.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I shall accept my master’s command, and protect Seah with my life!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Uncle. I don’t think she’ll be much help.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “She’s quite useful despite appearances.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s best if a situation where she needs to be useful doesn’t arise.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought as much and gestured to Ariel.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s go. We have a game to play.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh. I wanted to watch this pro…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Watch the replay.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I opened snacks…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Open more when we come back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master is so inconsiderate, except when dealing with Seah…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish~
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel, lounging on the sofa, eventually turned into smoke and entered Seong Jihan’s arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Today isn’t a day we play together, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah agreed to play together twice a week.
 </p>
 <p>
  This week, they had already completed two games.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll be back then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  And so, Seong Jihan who logged into the game was.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This mission is Survival.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Entering the ‘Experimental Zone’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Having reached level 75, he entered a new Survival map, ‘Experimental Zone’.

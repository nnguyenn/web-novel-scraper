  <strong>
   Chapter 131
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s inconvenient without Takeda.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ito Shizuru, in Akari’s body, furrowed her brows as she unpacked her luggage.
 </p>
 <p>
  Takeda Kazuo was currently under detention, led by the Korean government due to the previous incident and was in the midst of a legal battle, leaving her without any assistance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clink!
 </p>
 <p>
  As Akari’s hand paused while organizing the luggage, Ito Shizuru’s expression darkened further.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Again with this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When creating an avatar using the body of an ordinary person, this didn’t happen.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, since she made an avatar using the body of a Diamond Ranker this time, the control occasionally interrupted abruptly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially, this phenomenon intensified as the distance from Tokyo, where the main body was, increased.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Akari’s ego must have disappeared, but… just in case, I need to be careful.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She regretted for a moment that she should’ve just sent Sword King to secretly kidnap her.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shizuru quickly changed her mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No. If I’m unlucky and the Enchantment breaks, that won’t do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When she had placed the Enchantment on Sword King, the most headache-inducing thing was nothing but his fatherly love.
 </p>
 <p>
  Approaching him was easy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because he really liked women.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, maintaining the Enchantment was another issue.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Every time he went home, the Enchantment was half lifted.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The enchantment kept trying to break especially after seeing his daughter’s face.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shizuru, who did not give up, was able to obtain Sword King through lengthy efforts.
 </p>
 <p>
  She determined that Yoon Seah absolutely had to stay in Korea.
 </p>
 <p>
  If she went to Japan together and the Enchantment broke, anything could happen on the spot.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I must keep the two from meeting as much as possible this time I bring her to Japan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She should stay in a safe house in a distant area, not Tokyo.
 </p>
 <p>
  She set up her laptop inside the officetel, recalling Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  “She often goes shopping at the underground mart.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike Seong Jihan, who barely left the penthouse, Yoon Seah went out relatively often.
 </p>
 <p>
  The reason for her outings was mainly to purchase ingredients.
 </p>
 <p>
  The time was usually between 10 and 11 in the morning.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have to stay in the mart during that time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  While the mart was not small, it would not be easy to run into Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  In any case, unlike Seong Jihan, she could easily enchant Yoon Seah just by making contact.
 </p>
 <p>
  “As for the way back…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Her thoughts were gradually organizing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, the remaining plan was to check the route to return to Japan with her.
 </p>
 <p>
  After a while typing on the keyboard, she…
 </p>
 <p>
  Clink!
 </p>
 <p>
  Biting her lip at the sight of a finger stopping, she muttered,
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I need to finish quickly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Her body not obeying was a sign that she shouldn’t stay too long with this avatar.
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  The day after the survival game ended.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om
 </p>
 <p>
  “Survival didn’t trigger again right away.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, feeling disappointed, cleared the Invasion map he played before.
 </p>
 <p>
  He wanted to quickly get the Leaf of the World Tree completely engraved into his body.
 </p>
 <p>
  With 4 game modes being assigned randomly, the chance of getting Survival consecutively was low.
 </p>
 <p>
  “My level is 77…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The speed of leveling up was dazzling.
 </p>
 <p>
  A minimum of one level up per day.
 </p>
 <p>
  At this rate, a promotion battle seemed possible this month.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But the problem is the Martial Soul.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The stat he received at level 72, Martial Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  He invested the stat points he received every level up into it diligently and raised it to 104, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  After leveling up today and investing the stat points, the number did not increase to 105, it stalled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is similar to when I raised Martial Power in my last life.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In his past life, when he invested stat points into Martial Power, it didn’t just increase; he needed to accumulate a certain amount of training.
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, Martial Power increased steadily as he invested points, but after being revised to Martial Soul, it rose well to 104 but got stuck before 105.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I expected this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Star’s Ability, Martial Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  A few days passed since he acquired Martial Soul, but Seong Jihan had not yet utilized this power to 100%.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Martial Power and Force were not easy powers to handle, Martial Soul was a much higher-dimensional power, so he felt that eventually, the stat would not increase, just like the Martial Power in his previous life.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It just happened sooner than I thought.”

 <p>
  In the end, is training the only answer?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who arrived at the training room while swallowing his disappointment, let out a groan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Urrrgh….”
 </p>
 <p>
  There, he encountered Yoon Seah, who was exercising.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although she had already achieved a certain level of stat Perseverance, Yoon Seah, who did not stop strength training, put down her barbell upon seeing Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Haah… I’m dying… Uncle, are you ready for the training camp tomorrow?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, it’s near home. What is there to prepare?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You have to pack your clothes. We’re staying overnight, after all.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s fine. I’ll just throw in some clothes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… Should I pack for you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Agh. Do I look like a kid?”
 </p>
 <p>
  A conversation seemed to flip the roles of uncle and niece for a while.
 </p>
 <p>
  At some point, Yoon Seah, who had been stealing glances at Seong Jihan, quietly brought up the main point.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle. But can I… invite the sisters when you’re not here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sisters?… Who?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The guild sisters! Hayeon and Gayeong.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh, when did you get so close?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I got close to Gayeong while we worked out together as fitness buddies. And I just clicked with Hayeon because our conversations flow well…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Conversations flow well with Lee Hayeon?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s expression slightly hardened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You didn’t learn gambling from Hayeon, did you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, no! No, uncle, what… You think too lowly of Hayeon. She’s so capable and smart! Although she can’t predict matches…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You. Don’t ever try match prediction. You earned quite a bit, didn’t you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I know. I won’t, I won’t! I’m busy growing my channel these days, anyway.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan narrowed his eyes at Yoon Seah, who was flapping her hand as if to show off.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is somewhat suspicious.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Fine. They’re welcome if they come.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really? Okay. Hehe.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But now that I think about it, you’re the landlord. You don’t need my permission.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh. Is that so? But I thought I should ask you, uncle.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After responding to Yoon Seah, Seong Jihan conveyed in his mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Ariel. When you’re home, listen out for any gambling talk from Hayeon.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master. Don’t you trust Seah?]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Yeah. The long talk is suspicious.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [Understood.]
 </p>
 <p>
  He thus entrusted Ariel in his mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay. Now that I have Uncle’s permission, I’m going to do a bit of shopping.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Also… I’m gonna buy some alcohol?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Go ahead. You’re an adult.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right? Hehe.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Yoon Seah left the training room with a bright smile, Seong Jihan chuckled as if finding the situation absurd.
 </p>
 <p>
  Is it that exciting?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, I used to invite friends over a lot in the past, but I haven’t had the chance to do so recently.’
 </p>
 <p>
  After Sword King slaughtered the Korean representative team on 15th August, friends distanced themselves.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan’s stocks rose again recently, some friends who had cut him off started reaching out once more.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah resolutely cut all of them off.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s better to have no friends than maintain that kind of friendship.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather than clinging to old friends, he could just make new ones.
 </p>
 <p>
  The two people she befriended in the guild seemed nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan hoped that they would form a good relationship with each other.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Ariel. You must make sure of any gambling.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [I got it!]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Lee Hayeon is the problem. Keep a close eye on her persuasion.’
 </p>
 <p>
  […Aren’t you being too wary of the Guild Master? But why entrust such a task to her?]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘She’s capable in every other aspect. Gambling is the problem.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Being cautious of Lee Hayeon, known as Zero in his previous life, could never be too much.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Should I start monitoring now?]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘From now?’
 </p>
 <p>
  [What if they talk on a call about gambling while she’s shopping?]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That’s a bit much. It feels like an invasion of privacy.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [You never know, right? And if it’s not about gambling, I won’t inform you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Well, if that’s the case.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan hesitated for a moment, then nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  In case his niece became friends with a gambling addict and got involved in betting, he wouldn’t have the face to meet his sister even in the afterlife.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I must stop this now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan secretly dispatched Ariel to tail Yoon Seah.

 </p>
 <p>
  – Player Seong Jihan will enter the BattleNet Center tomorrow. National team coach Noh Youngjun expressed his anticipation, calling him an astonishing player and promising to assign him a suitable role through training during the camp period…
 </p>
 <p>
  Slurp!
 </p>
 <p>
  Shizuru was watching the TV news while eating cup noodles.
 </p>
 <p>
  Korean news channels were extensively covering Seong Jihan’s entry into the BattleNet Center.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He’s probably as popular as the former Sword King by now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though BattleNet’s popularity was absolute, all sorts of media were making a fuss just because one player entered the BattleNet Center.
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to the last time she came to Korea, Seong Jihan’s status had risen significantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What if I also join in this situation…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  She smiled as if she was pleased.
 </p>
 <p>
  She didn’t have any particular feelings toward Korea as a country.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather, she was once a fan of a Korean idol and thus learned Korean to this proficient level.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why are all the kids I want here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  What can you do when all the exceptional players keep emerging from Korea?
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially Sword King and Seong Jihan, talents who could greatly strengthen Japan’s Warrior class lineup, considered a weakness for so long.
 </p>
 <p>
  If both of them work as a dynamic duo on the Japanese team, wouldn’t they easily snatch the victory in the World League?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Yoon Seah could also be useful if nurtured.’
 </p>
 <p>
  She imagined a scene where Japanese is spoken publicly in BattleNet channel 0.
 </p>
 <p>
  It would be quite rewarding once that day comes.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘By the way… Seong Jihan will be gone from tomorrow.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Shizuru thoughtfully tossed the empty cup noodles into the sink.
 </p>
 <p>
  Surely he wouldn’t bring Yoon Seah, a full-grown adult, to the training camp.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If Yoon Seah is left alone… the training period is a perfect opportunity.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Deciding not to miss this chance, Shizuru resolved to check the underground mart layout once more.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then, as she went down to the mart, she.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Huh?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Was able to spot Yoon Seah, who had been out of sight for several days.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sis~ What alcohol should I buy? Huh. You’re buying so much?”
 </p>
 <p>
  She was on a call, cheerfully filling her cart with various food items and indiscriminately adding different kinds of alcohol.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… Is alcohol really necessary for a lecture on analysis methods? Can you analyze while drinking? As expected, it’s half the fun…”
 </p>
 <p>
  She seemed happy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shizuru smiled as if she was genuinely pleased to see Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll make you even happier from now on, my daughter~.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah was already her daughter in her mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shizuru hurriedly approached her.
 </p>
 <p>
  To use the supporting gift, ‘Edit’, a touch was necessary.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The beer is…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Shizuru approached, pretending to buy the beer behind Yoon Seah,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She feigned stumbling and lightly touched Yoon Seah’s arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  To anyone watching, it would merely seem like an accident.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Too easy.’
 </p>
 <p>
  However, with that touch, the supporting gift ‘Edit’ was activated, and when Yoon Seah’s status abnormality editing window opened.
 </p>
 <p>
  She quickly added Enchantment and Obedience.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Now where…….’
 </p>
 <p>
  Should she give a command to this girl?
 </p>
 <p>
  Shizuru thought it was all over, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  Zap!
 </p>
 <p>
  From the crown-shaped mark engraved on Yoon Seah’s hand, electricity surged.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Seal of Thunder resists mental contamination.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Enchantment’ does not fully take hold.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Obedience’ does not fully take hold.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Huh? What’s this?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Shizuru furrowed her brows at the sudden message.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Seal of Thunder?
 </p>
 <p>
  What is this that’s resisting?
 </p>
 <p>
  “……Huh? You…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Yoon Seah stared at her with a pause.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This won’t do.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Shizuru tried to touch her hand again.
 </p>
 <p>
  If Enchantment and Obedience do not fully take hold.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just touch again and edit until it does.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, her attempt was.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Blocked by a black hand rising from the floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You… What are you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel, who had been secretly following behind Yoon Seah, sprang up from the floor.

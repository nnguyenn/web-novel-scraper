  <strong>
   Chapter 132
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shizuru…!?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah hastily retreated.
 </p>
 <p>
  The message that had appeared to Shizuru was also looming similar for Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Seal of Thunder resists mental contamination.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Cannot completely resist ‘Enchantment’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Cannot completely resist ‘Obedience’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even as she looked at Shizuru, who wore a common face under her disguise, Yoon Seah’s heart pounded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although not entirely enchanted, for some reason, she felt an urge to kneel and worship her.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yoon Seah! Snap out of it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Only when Ariel shouted did she startle and quickly withdraw.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh dear, where are you going?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  Shizuru, swatting off Ariel’s shadow hand, spoke leisurely to Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  The chance to easily take Yoon Seah was gone.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, she didn’t lose her confidence in this situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s just a summon, not Seong Jihan. I can quickly defeat it with Akari’s body.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  Shizuru drew a dagger from her inventory and swung it.
 </p>
 <p>
  The red dagger, obviously extraordinary, shone at first glance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Her skill with the dagger, compared to the body’s original owner, Akari, was considerably clumsy.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, as the blade flashed red,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel’s arm split in half, with a flame surging through the gap.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although she tried to regenerate her body using the power of shadow,
 </p>
 <p>
  The fire stubbornly burned, interfering with the recovery.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s a good weapon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thanks to many sponsors.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Shizuru, though less skilled than Akari, compensated with items.
 </p>
 <p>
  Being nearly the top player behind the scenes in Japan, she was fully equipped with everything money and power could buy.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can’t stop her alone.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel quickly assessed the situation and shouted to Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah. Run! And contact Master.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, got it…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah~ where are you going? Come here. Don’t you want to see your Dad?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How dare you speak of Dad…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehe. From now on, you can call me Mom.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Call her Mom?
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah clenched her fists.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was like cold water being poured onto her Enchantment-muddled mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I absolutely can’t be caught here!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks to her Seal of Thunder, she resisted once, but if caught again, she couldn’t guarantee what would happen next.
 </p>
 <p>
  If she were to be enchanted and obedient and taken to Japan,
 </p>
 <p>
  She might have to call that woman ‘Mom’ for real.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s better to die than that…!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, gritting her teeth and fleeing, called Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle! Shizuru is here in the underground mart…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [What?!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Even before the call ended,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shizuru? You should call me Mom, Seah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Shizuru, now transparent and in a spirit form, approached Yoon Seah, ignoring Ariel’s attacking shadow sword from behind.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This. Crazy… how many items does she have?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The cause was an item, again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the clothes Shizuru wore—a t-shirt and shorts—offered no defense,
 </p>
 <p>
  Thump!
 </p>
 <p>
  Even as the shadow sword tried to pierce her chest,
 </p>
 <p>
  A talisman popped out of nowhere, blocking the attack.
 </p>
 <p>
  A single-use protective talisman that automatically blocks an attack.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite its phenomenal performance, its astronomical price deterred even top players from purchasing it.
 </p>
 <p>
  But as Ariel attacked, they continuously popped out of Shizuru.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I already spent 50 billion yen because of our Seah… you should compensate for this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swiiiish!
 </p>
 <p>
  Shizuru, dissolving her spirit form to touch Yoon Seah, smiled triumphantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was a moment of resistance, but once captured, it would be the end.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though Yoon Seah was an outstanding player, she was just a Silver.
 </p>
 <p>
  She would not escape from the grasp of herself, a Diamond Rank, any longer.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Inventory.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah hastily pulled something out of her inventory and raised both hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Heh. What are you doing?”
 </p>
 <p>
  At first, Shizuru, seeing Yoon Seah acting strangely in mid-air, scoffed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Yoon Seah’s figure disappeared completely, Shizuru’s expression hardened.
 </p>
 <p>
  What’s going on?
 </p>
 <p>
  She was a fish already caught.
 </p>
 <p>
  Where did she go?
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  ‘Is it a cloak of invisibility or something?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Shizuru hastily reached towards where Yoon Seah disappeared, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…She’s gone.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Nothing, there was nothing to grasp.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  In the past, Seong Jihan handed over the Veil of the Void to Yoon Seah in preparation for Xin Youhwa’s air raid.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although it became useless after Xin Youhwa died.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle, I don’t need this anymore, right? You should take it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, keep it with you. What do I have to hide from?”
 </p>
 <p>
  He had no particular reason to hide, so he completely handed over the Veil of the Void to Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just, don’t hide for too long. You can get buried in the void.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The hiding effect of the Veil of the Void was outstanding.
 </p>
 <p>
  But due to the creepy penalty, Seong Jihan instructed to only use it in real danger.
 </p>
 <p>
  After reading the item description, Yoon Seah tried not to use the Veil of the Void unless necessary.
 </p>
 <p>
  The only time she actually used it was the first time during practice.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I was told not to move…….’
 </p>
 <p>
  The world inside the veil.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was not particularly different from the real world.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s just that the world moved about twice as fast as usual.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah watched with trembling heart as Shizuru reached out to her, but
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoooosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The hand passed through Yoon Seah’s body as if through thin air, and came back.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Phew.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It really works. She sighed inwardly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Now, do I just wait for Uncle to come?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking so, Yoon Seah suddenly felt pitiful.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘……I can’t do anything without Uncle.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks to Seong Jihan’s Seal of Thunder and Ariel.
 </p>
 <p>
  And thanks to the gifted Veil of the Void, she was able to escape the crisis.
 </p>
 <p>
  If even one of these wasn’t available.
 </p>
 <p>
  She might have already been calling Shizuru “Mom” and following her to Japan.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Mom? That crazy…….’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking of calling Shizuru her mom, she felt her blood surge.
 </p>
 <p>
  How can one refer to oneself with such a loose-lipped manner?
 </p>
 <p>
  Shizuru was the first person to be targeted of Yoon Seah’s murderous intent.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I could, that woman. I want to beat her with my power…….’
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking at the enemy in front of her, Yoon Seah harbored her grudge, but no matter how great her Gift was, she had no power at the moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  Chewing on her powerlessness and trying only to stand still, Yoon Seah,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Uh…….’
 </p>
 <p>
  Saw a light blue mist rising in bunches from afar. A change was beginning to occur in the world inside the veil, which was identical to the real world.
 </p>
 <p>
  While watching it, she recalled the penalty of the Veil of the Void.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Could that be, the void…….’
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish! Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  Shizuru reached towards where Yoon Seah disappeared several times and then looked back at Ariel.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You…… know something?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even if I know, should I tell?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shouldn’t you tell me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swinging her dagger three times, Shizuru spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whooosh……!
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, Ariel’s arms and legs were all cut and began to burn.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Consider it an honor for a summoned creature like you to serve me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Shizuru sincerely said that and approached Ariel.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though her supporting gift was exceptional, it had significant limitations in Enchantment and Obedience.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, originally, she wouldn’t have used Enchantment on such a summoned creature because it would have been wasteful.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to take her quickly.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In order to kidnap Yoon Seah, Shizuru steeled herself to use Enchantment on the summon as well and reached out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thump!
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as she was about to place her hand on Ariel’s face and cast Enchantment, she,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh……”
 </p>
 <p>
  Was astonished and gaped.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You…… what are……”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you think I will fall for the Enchantment of such a lower-ranking species? Me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The difference between species……?”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a face full of astonishment, Shizuru stared at Ariel.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although it was her first time using Enchantment on a different species, the moment she opened Ariel’s status window, she instinctively felt an overwhelming difference in rank.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This isn’t just a difference in species, it’s more than that!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Is this really the summoned creature that easily lost its limbs?
 </p>
 <p>
  She hastily removed her hand from Ariel, shaking.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hooh…… you do have eyes to see.”nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite losing its limbs, Ariel spoke leisurely.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shizuru bit her lip.
 </p>
 <p>
  Subduing Ariel was impossible, and if she wasted more time here, Seong Jihan would arrive.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……I’ll have to wait till next time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swooosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Her body slowly became transparent.
 </p>
 <p>
  “See you again. Daughter.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Waving towards where Yoon Seah disappeared, she concealed herself.
 </p>
 <p>
  And almost at the same time.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ariel!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master. You came quickly.”
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Swooosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan arrived, Ariel, empowered by the shadow energy, restored her limbs and stood up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How did it go? Where’s Seah?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Over there.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Ariel pointed to the thin air and pretended to flip something, Seong Jihan let out a sigh of relief.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Veil of the Void… It was good that it wasn’t taken back.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shizuru? Did she run away?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. But I’ve attached a shadow to her.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel hadn’t been idle either.
 </p>
 <p>
  A little while ago, when Shizuru touched Ariel, she discreetly attached a shadow to her.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel, now recovered, briefly closed her eyes and soon located Shizuru.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Interestingly… she’s in this building.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “On the 19th floor. Seems like she rented an officetel.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really? Seah, let’s go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan called Yoon Seah, she popped out of the thin air.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her face was dazed, stunned.
 </p>
 <p>
  Snap!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan clapped his hands in front of her, she quickly came to her senses.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s go quickly. We need to suppress Shizuru before she escapes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan had a murderous air about him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah had never seen her uncle so angry before.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Am… Am I a hindrance?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If a dangerous situation arises, use the veil again. Leaving you here alone is rather worrisome.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Saying that, Seong Jihan embraced Yoon Seah’s waist.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hold on tight.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, moving at ultra-high speed, exited the mart.
 </p>
 <p>
  In an instant, he came out of the building and
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that the place?”
 </p>
 <p>
  He flew straight towards a window on the 19th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crash!
 </p>
 <p>
  Glass shattered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How… How did you know?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Shizuru, who was grabbing her laptop, looked at Seong Jihan with a defeated expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why so fast….”
 </p>
 <p>
  Before Shizuru could finish speaking, Seong Jihan swung his black sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Screech!
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, dozens of talismans sprang from Shizuru’s bosom and burned up all at once.
 </p>
 <p>
  Talismans that had the effect of preventing fatal injuries, dozens of them disappeared with a single strike.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mon… Monster!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Had this human become an even more insane monster than before?
 </p>
 <p>
  Shizuru quickly assessed the situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  She can’t escape this.
 </p>
 <p>
  In that case…
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  She opened the laptop screen and threw the dagger she was holding into it.
 </p>
 <p>
  The red dagger that had easily incapacitated Ariel.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead of breaking the screen, the dagger was sucked into it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I should send the national treasure away.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Simultaneously with those words.
 </p>
 <p>
  Screech!
 </p>
 <p>
  Shizuru’s body split open, and blood veins were exposed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now that all the protective talismans were shattered, there was no defense.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking at her own body, Shizuru, feeling no pain, merely commented, seemingly regretful.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah. What a waste… how I had controlled this body. It’s dying so soon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swooosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Shizuru’s face, which had been ordinary, began to change.
 </p>
 <p>
  Transforming into the bewitching appearance she had shown when enchanting Seong Jihan before,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah, if you want to see Dad, come to Japan. I’ll be waiting.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With those last words.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her face changed back to that of the original owner of the body, Akari.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… I… I am… Aaaaah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, Akari, feeling extreme pain unlike Shizuru just a moment before,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Wh, wh, where… is this… You’re Seong Jihan…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Contrary to before, she babbled in Japanese.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is she saying?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [She’s asking where this is. Seems like a different person.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm…”
 </p>
 <p>
  It didn’t seem like an act, considering her inexplicable appearance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan sheathed his sword and reached out to Akari.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Great Heal.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, Akari’s split body began to heal rapidly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although new Support skills couldn’t be learned All For One, he could still use the ones he had.
 </p>
 <p>
  And with Martial Soul achieved, the effect of the heal was incredibly enhanced, so Akari, who seemed about to die any moment, quickly returned to normal.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Wh, what did… you do?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nothing much. Your body should be healthy now since you don’t feel any pain.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan glared at Akari with menacing eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I need you to spill… information about Shizuru. Without omitting a single detail.”

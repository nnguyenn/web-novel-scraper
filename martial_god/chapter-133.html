  <strong>
   Chapter 133
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Shizuru went too far targeting Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan gritted his teeth.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If it wasn’t for Ariel, it would have been a catastrophe.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If she hadn’t stalled in the middle, Yoon Seah might have also followed Shizuru.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can’t just be a sitting duck.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Offense is the best defense.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to prepare a counterattack.
 </p>
 <p>
  What he needed for that was, of course, information.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s take her immediately and interrogate her. She must spill every secret.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing Seong Jihan’s stern demeanor, Ariel, who had become a sword, changed her appearance back to a shadow elf.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Interrogation? That’s my specialty. Master, may I participate?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You… are quite cooperative, huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I suffered quite a humiliation from this woman. That red dagger gave me quite a hard time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The dagger transmitted through the laptop screen?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. At least SS-grade… no, I’m sure it’s… an SSS-grade item. That woman, she’s smeared with money all over.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Was the mere red-glowing dagger such an extraordinary weapon?
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed it wasn’t a lie when it was called a national treasure.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright. Let’s do this together.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The two began discussing their sinister interrogation plan.
 </p>
 <p>
  But then…
 </p>
 <p>
  [Wait, wait! I’ll tell you everything!!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Akari, who was to be the subject of the interrogation, showed no intention of resisting.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Because of Shizuru, I thought I was going to live and die as a marionette after my body was taken. I will cooperate fully!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Trembling!
 </p>
 <p>
  Akari shook, clutching her arms.
 </p>
 <p>
  [And that woman… after she took over my body, to verify she had full control, she used it to kill my parents… and then laughed at me, saying I couldn’t resist.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…So she says, Master.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Tsk!
 </p>
 <p>
  The statement involuntarily made him click his tongue.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘She was more vicious than I imagined.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, Seong Jihan conversed with Akari through Ariel as a translator.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Place of residence?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Mine? I…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not yours, Shizuru’s.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ah! Yes. She has a house in Tokyo and also in Kyoto. Mostly in Tokyo’s…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Starting with her place of residence, Akari immediately responded to every question.
 </p>
 <p>
  She did not stop there and even spilled all of Shizuru’s weaknesses that she knew of.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Shizuru is obsessed with Akashic Pages. She even created a comprehensive trading company that only purchases Akashic Pages.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “She created a company just for Akashic Pages?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. It’s called SZ Company. It’s a global enterprise spread across the world… and also…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Akari spilled everything she knew about Shizuru.
 </p>
 <p>
  This even included murder incidents committed by Akari herself under Shizuru’s command.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan listened to her story and pondered.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Akashic Pages themselves were sustaining Shizuru.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Akashic Pages that enhance the performance of Supporting Gifts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shizuru was using her abilities beyond their limits by obtaining them at every opportunity.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Akashic Pages are the problem. I’d like to completely cut off her supply.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Once the tutorial ends, Akashic Pages will rarely appear. If we wait a few months, they will disappear.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really? But I can’t stand to watch her be so triumphant until then…”
 </p>
 <p>
  He looked at Akari.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can you repeat what you’ve just said during a BattleTube broadcast?”
 </p>
 <p>
  […Yes. Of course. If it will harm that woman, I’ll do anything.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good. Let’s get a spot ready soon. And Seah, you…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at Yoon Seah, who was standing beside him with her head bowed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s the matter?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, Uncle. I’m sorry for today’s incident…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you have to be sorry about? I also didn’t expect something like this to happen.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t something the victim should apologize for.
 </p>
 <p>
  He should rather be thankful that she was safe.
 </p>
 <p>
  “However, you’ll have to stick with me until the matter with Shizuru is resolved. Who knows what crazy thing she might do next.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll stick to you like a magnet from now on!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s a good idea. But you… Were you okay using the Veil of the Void?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Um… I did see a kind of turquoise fog blooming in clusters from afar.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  He had experienced nothing while he was enveloped in it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Had he been slightly late, even if Shizuru didn’t get to her, she could have been buried in the void.
 </p>
 <p>
  “And… I didn’t notice out of shock until a moment ago, but a class evolution job called Void Archer has been added.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Void Archer?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. It’s sparkling a lot compared to the other classes?”
 </p>
 <p>
  A sparkling class?
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Hearing this, Ariel, who was beside them, asked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What color is it sparkling?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Gold.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A Unique… class.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh. Unique, is it? What’s that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. It seems like you obtained it by witnessing the void. Void Archer… Although it’s generally advised not to get involved with the void.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you get involved there, they say you can disappear without a trace anytime.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, who was initially happy to hear about the Unique class, couldn’t hide her disappointment at Ariel’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then I should give up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’d be a shame to give up the title of ‘Unique’. The information about the void is just a rumor after all. If you want power, it might be good to choose it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really? Hmm… I need to think about it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  An unexpected class obtained through the Veil of the Void.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah decided to consider a bit more whether to change her class to this one.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, Seong Jihan spoke to Akari with a gesture.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, shall we go up and broadcast?”
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  [We were ambushed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s channel, which had gained millions of subscribers in no time.
 </p>
 <p>
  When the unusual word ‘ambush’ appeared in the title of the upcoming live broadcast video, waves of anticipation and unease began to build.
 </p>
 <p>
  – What, Seong Jihan got ambushed?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Uh, what? ambushed? all of a sudden?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wasn’t there chaos in the Sword Palace underground mart earlier?
 </p>
 <p>
  – I heard Seong Jihan fell from the penthouse…Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  – Eh?? Why did he fall? Is he alive?
 </p>
 <p>
  – He’s alive, that’s why the channel is still up, lol. Seems like he tried to go down quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rumors about the incident were already spreading.
 </p>
 <p>
  People were just waiting for Seong Jihan to start broadcasting.
 </p>
 <p>
  And soon, as the broadcast began:
 </p>
 <p>
  – Huh? Who is that?
 </p>
 <p>
  – I’ve never seen that woman before?
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers were puzzled.
 </p>
 <p>
  A woman with a tense face was sitting in the center of the screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was standing at the edge of the screen, arms crossed.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Could it be his girlfriend?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Did he reject Sophia and… go with that woman? No way, lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  – That person! She’s a ninja from Japan, isn’t she?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Oh my, is she the one who ambushed Seong Jihan last time?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Yes, yes, yes, yes. She was quite famous in Japan. After being defeated by Seong Jihan last time, she didn’t broadcast anymore.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the live viewers surpassed hundreds of thousands, many knew about Akari’s identity.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Weren’t the two enemies?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Why is she suddenly on the broadcast?
 </p>
 <p>
  While people were bewildered:
 </p>
 <p>
  [I am Kato Akari…]
 </p>
 <p>
  She opened her mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Is this the real one? Seems legit.
 </p>
 <p>
  – I need to turn on the translation feature.
 </p>
 <p>
  Initially, viewers listened without taking it too seriously.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Today, I came forward to reveal everything about Ito Shizuru, the vile woman who is ruling from behind in Japan…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Beginning with that statement,
 </p>
 <p>
  She exposed everything she knew during the broadcast.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sometimes rambling, but as she revealed all the information about Ito Shizuru,
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers were shocked.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Woah… Damn, isn’t this an exclusive scoop?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Murdering, brainwashing, and even seizing the player’s body? What, is she a god?
 </p>
 <p>
  – This editing is crazy, lol. Is there anything she can’t do? Lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Is this because of Akashic Page’s support or something?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Even so, she’s god-tier at this point;
 </p>
 <p>
  [And then…]
 </p>
 <p>
  The broadcast time had already passed 30 minutes, but Akari’s mouth didn’t rest.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s how overflowing Ito Shizuru’s wicked deeds were.
 </p>
 <p>
  – How can we believe this? Is Akari just blabbering anything because she was threatened? Lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  – What are you talking about, isn’t it weird that she is in Korea in the first place? Lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  – For real, why is this Japanese girl in the penthouse? Lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although some people spoke of not believing Akari’s exposure, claiming that she and Seong Jihan were in cahoots,
 </p>
 <p>
  Given the circumstances, it was an unbelievable claim, and they were refuted by other viewers.
 </p>
 <p>
  [There… Ah. Aaah…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  While talking for a while, Akari
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly grabbed her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  [How far is this crazy woman going to speak…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, with a different tone from before, a voice burst out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Akari’s face began to twist grotesquely.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her face started to morph, turning from her original appearance into Shizuru, who once boasted godly beauty.
 </p>
 <p>
  But, the mixed appearance of her original face and that face made it seem nothing short of monstrous.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ew, what is that?
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  – Ewwww, what is that?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ah, sh*t. I can’t watch horror movies, and I regret turning on the broadcast.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Die!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Shizuru’s fragment, trying to stop Akari’s revelation.
 </p>
 <p>
  She tried to commit suicide by taking over her body.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘She was still there?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan grabbed Akari’s head.
 </p>
 <p>
  An anomalous energy, which wasn’t there when he checked a while ago, had been hiding in her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Here you are.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Shooooo~
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan extracted that energy, smoke rose from Akari’s head.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Aaaargh…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, with a scream.
 </p>
 <p>
  Akari’s face, which had been distorted, returned to its original state.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps due to the recent commotion, she was sweating profusely.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…You all saw it, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  She resumed her exposé.
 </p>
 <p>
  After broadcasting for over 2 hours, she finally said,
 </p>
 <p>
  “If I remember anything else, I’ll let you know.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Akari’s exposé had ended.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the aftermath of this broadcast was just beginning.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  At Shizuru’s mansion in Tokyo, people were already gathering to gawk after seeing the address disclosed in the broadcast.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Yes. Yes. Prime Minister. No, you trust me, right? It’s just Akari’s one-sided claims.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why would I commit murder? Chairman, did you see me as such a person?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Overwhelmed by the incoming calls, Shizuru was at her wit’s end.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the previous calls were mainly out of concern, now they were primarily to verify the truth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Checking the list of callers, she frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It seems only those less affected by the Enchantment are calling. I need to meet and strengthen the Enchantment…’
 </p>
 <p>
  For that, she would need the Akashic Page.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking of Akari, who had also exposed the existence of SZ Company., she gritted her teeth.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Useless avatar. Can’t it even commit suicide?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead of ranting, it should’ve quickly ended its life.
 </p>
 <p>
  What was the point in letting Akari continue speaking after being subdued by Seong Jihan?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shizuru, are you okay?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Yes, Ryuhei.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you need help with anything?”
 </p>
 <p>
  She looked into the concerned eyes of the Sword King and had a spark in her eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite witnessing her and Akari’s exposé, the unwavering support from the Sword King was reassuring.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Right… As long as I have the Sword King under my control.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In the Japanese national team, the Sword King’s position is paramount.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he continues to support Shizuru unshaken, her current position might waver but won’t be overturned.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ryuhei, I… I’m struggling…”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a tearful expression, she nestled herself into the Sword King’s embrace.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I did everything for the country…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m here for you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ll always be, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Though tears flowed from Shizuru’s eyes, they seemed deeper than usual.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, at the BattleNet Center,
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Dongwoo, the leader of the national team of Warriors, was deep in thought about how to welcome Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He’s annoying, but… in this world, power speaks volumes. We need to show our best.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Having been overwhelmingly defeated by Seong Jihan, he was planning to integrate him smoothly into the national Warrior team without further conflicts.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘After all, what strengthens the bond between men better than booze and women?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Dongwoo thought this as a matter of fact.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Coach, is it okay to hold a welcome party for player Seong Jihan?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A welcome party? Given the recent chaos, is it a good idea?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “With the current situation, wouldn’t a welcome party be more necessary?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm, alright. But you’re not inviting outsiders, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Laughing at the coach’s worry, Kim Dongwoo waved it off.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nah, not outsiders. Just a celebration among ourselves.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright. As long as you assimilate well without any issues.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With the permission from Coach Noh Youngjun, as soon as Kim Dongwoo stepped out, he immediately called someone.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, what are you doing tomorrow?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Huh? It’s a weekday. I have to do the news.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re throwing a celebration for Seong Jihan. Can you bring some friends?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Wow! Really?! Is Seong Jihan really coming?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, if you come alone, you won’t get in. Bring lots of friends.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Oh my… Of course! If they know Seong Jihan is coming, everyone will want to see him.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s popularity in South Korea was unmatched, second only to the Sword King.
 </p>
 <p>
  The chance to meet him would even have top celebrities eager to attend.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Looking forward to seeing new faces.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Dongwoo thought with a sly smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He doesn’t seem to have a girlfriend. I should set him up with someone.’
 </p>
 <p>

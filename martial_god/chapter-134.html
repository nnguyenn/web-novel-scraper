 </p>
 <p>
  Reporters had already gathered like clouds at the entrance of the BattleNet Center.
 </p>
 <p>
  With every arrival of a national representative player, they incessantly flashed their cameras, while muttering complaints under their breath.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really… Another wasted effort.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “When exactly is that person coming?”
 </p>
 <p>
  There was a particular person the reporters were eagerly waiting for.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh… What’s such a waste?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, nothing…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if spoken softly, national representative-level players could hear it.
 </p>
 <p>
  The players gave the complaining reporters a passing glance of disbelief and moved on.
 </p>
 <p>
  After about ten arrivals enduring the barrage of flashes, a large limousine, associated with the administration, boldly pulled up to the center’s entrance.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan emerged from the vehicle, a resounding shout spread amongst the reporters.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s Seong Jihan!”ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m
 </p>
 <p>
  In response, the reporters eagerly raised their cameras.
 </p>
 <p>
  Click! Click! Click! Click!
 </p>
 <p>
  The difference in the intensity of the flashes was clear.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh? Someone else is getting out!”
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t just Seong Jihan who emerged from the large limousine.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, Ariel, and Akari made their appearances in succession.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that woman Akari?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He even has his summon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did he bring Yoon Seah because of yesterday’s incident?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Some reporters, who had been waiting in advance, hurriedly approached and shoved their microphones forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mr. Seong Jihan! Please share your thoughts heading into the match against Russia!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We heard about the attack yesterday! Since then…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The government announced they won’t overlook this incident. Your thoughts…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was quickly surrounded by reporters.
 </p>
 <p>
  As his expression slightly tightened, the reporters grew tense as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He wouldn’t lash out today, right?’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s his first day as a national representative. Surely he’d show some restraint?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Though they knew of his frequent use of Force, they believed that Seong Jihan would kindly give interviews today.
 </p>
 <p>
  But,
 </p>
 <p>
  That wasn’t the case for Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  He gently raised a hand, saying,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, I’m quite sensitive to crowds because of yesterday’s incident. Excuse me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh… Wh-what?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The reporters suddenly found their voices and movements restricted.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  A few journalists who got too close were lifted and pushed back.
 </p>
 <p>
  A perfect enforced distancing.
 </p>
 <p>
  The path in front of Seong Jihan, which had been blocked by the reporters, cleared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll give a detailed statement later during the interview.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as it seemed this sequence of events was drawing to a close,
 </p>
 <p>
  An unexpected challenge arose.
 </p>
 <p>
  [“Miss Kato! Was everything you said yesterday true? Ito’s side is vehemently arguing that you actually framed her for murder!”]
 </p>
 <p>
  [“Japan is also demanding the extradition of the heinous criminal who committed the murder! What are your thoughts?”]
 </p>
 <p>
  A Japanese broadcast journalist, speaking in Japanese, approached Akari instead of Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  The biggest topic in Japan was the revelation made by Akari, making her a more interesting story to Japanese reporters than Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Akari sharply glared at the journalist.
 </p>
 <p>
  [“What? They’re accusing me of killing my parents?”]
 </p>
 <p>
  [“That’s the counter-argument from Ito’s side! If not you, who would’ve done it?”]
 </p>
 <p>
  [“Such groundless rumors…”]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hold on, don’t engage.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan stopped Akari who was about to retort.
 </p>
 <p>
  She had no choice but to turn her back on the reporters, grinding her teeth in frustration.
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  The interior of the BattleNet Center boasted a splendor that would make even the finest hotels pale in comparison.

 <p>
  “Mr. Seong Jihan! Please, this way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Manager Park Yoonsik, who had been waiting in advance, led Seong Jihan’s group to the top floor of the center.
 </p>
 <p>
  “As you requested yesterday, we’ve reserved three adjacent rooms for you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do we have separate rooms? Shouldn’t I share a room with my uncle? We need to be close.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah seemed deeply affected by the events of the previous day and wanted to stay as close as possible to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If we’re in adjacent rooms, I can still keep track. It’s fine.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really? Yesterday we were in the same place.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “As long as the distance isn’t as extreme as from the top floor to the basement, I can cover it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After reassuring Yoon Seah, Seong Jihan then turned to Ariel.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ll need to share a room with Akari for the time being.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “With her? Is it for surveillance?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We can’t be entirely sure yet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon Ariel’s translation, Akari nodded in understanding.
 </p>
 <p>
  Manager Park Yoonsik, who had been observing their conversation, cautiously spoke up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The National Intelligence Service’s BattleNet division has requested a discussion with Miss Akari.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The National Intelligence Service?”
 </p>
 <p>
  After North Korea’s collapse into a dungeon, the counterintelligence division of the National Intelligence Service transitioned to focus on BattleNet-related matters.
 </p>
 <p>
  Following the sudden departure of the Sword King to Japan, and the appearance of the insider Akari, the agency took interest in her.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, they believe a cross-checking of the information with Akari is essential for the media battle against Japan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon hearing Ariel’s translation, Akari’s eyes flashed with anger.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Akari, will you cooperate?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I will. I will do anything as long as I can harm Shizuru.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps due to the earlier confrontation with the Japanese journalist, her resentment had deepened.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I’ll kill her…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Having stolen her body, and using it to even kill her parents, Akari’s voice was filled with murderous intent.
 </p>
 <p>
  “She seems very keen.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “… Understood. I’ll relay that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘She’s really a Diamond Rank assassin… Her aura is no joke.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Sweating nervously, Manager Park Yoonsik hastily nodded in agreement.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the BattleNet Center on the 2nd floor, in the national representative strategy room, Korea’s top 100 players had gathered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Today, we’ll be training on the ‘Southgate’ map, which is designated for the 1st and 2nd rounds.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Southgate.
 </p>
 <p>
  A map where a battle ensues to protect the southern gate of a fortress.
 </p>
 <p>
  In one round, players defend the fortress, and in another, they invade it.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the most fundamental game used in national representative battles.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This map is basically a tutorial.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan concluded after listening to the briefing by Coach Noh Youngjun on the podium.
 </p>
 <p>
  The fortress gate in the Southgate map is already breached in the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Warriors form lines to defend it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Archers and wizards deter the enemies from atop the fortress.
 </p>
 <p>
  Supporters heal their teammates or debuff the enemies.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was the basic gameplay of the Southgate map.
 </p>
 <p>
  “… As you all know, this map greatly emphasizes the Warrior division. How long they hold the breached south gate determines the point difference.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The performance of the Warrior division, acting as the gate of the fortress, often determined the outcome of the Southgate map game.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the Warrior line collapsed and the enemies stepped inside the gate, the point loss would be irrevocable.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Despite the pessimistic predictions regarding our chances due to the map’s nature and our team’s perceived weakness, I believe our players will shatter such views. Especially since we now have a formidable player on our team.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Coach Noh Youngjun then gestured for Seong Jihan to stand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I am Seong Jihan. I look forward to working with you all.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Rising from his seat to offer a brief greeting, Seong Jihan then sat back down.
 </p>
 <p>
  In front of the veteran national representatives, Seong Jihan’s demeanor was quite stiff, almost to the point of seeming arrogant.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clap! Clap! Clap!
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the other representatives didn’t mind at all and welcomed him with applause.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whistle!
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially the players from positions other than Warrior, they enthusiastically, very enthusiastically, greeted Seong Jihan, even with whistles.
 </p>
 <p>
  “He’s finally here!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Great… Now we have a chance.”
 </p>
 <p>
  This was because the Warrior division was notoriously weak, often referred to as an ‘automatic door’.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, with Seong Jihan, who had been the center of attention today, joining the team, significant changes were anticipated.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Today, we’ll focus on enhancing the teamwork of the Warrior division.”
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

 </div>
 <p>
  “Yes!”
 </p>
 <p>
  And so the practice began.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The leader of the Warrior division, Kim Dongwoo, approached Seong Jihan with a smile, accompanied by another player.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I owe you one from before.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Owe? We all got taken down with one punch. Hehe.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, quiet! Do you want to bring up that embarrassing past?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You were the one who mentioned owing him first!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Recalling the national representative selection test where Seong Jihan had easily defeated them with a single punch, the Warriors were surprisingly friendly toward him, likely because of the overwhelming defeat they faced back then.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anyway, now that we’re one team, let’s practice hard and synchronize our movements.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, I understand.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Haha, let’s be comfortable with each other now. May I ask your age?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m 27.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh. I’m 30. Is it alright if we speak informally?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan gave Kim Dongwoo a thoughtful look.
 </p>
 <p>
  He’s quite friendly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There’s no need to be distant.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Given that they were both on the national representative team and, as Warriors, would often be grouped together, it would be better if they got along well.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan gave a slight nod in agreement.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh! Really? Are you sure? Oh, you are!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Brother! I’m Lee Yoongi. Please call me informally too!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon seeing Seong Jihan’s warm acceptance, Lee Yoongi, who was standing nearby, eagerly called out to him using a familiar term.
 </p>
 <p>
  Coach Noh Youngjun watched from a distance, letting out a sigh of relief.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’m glad Dongwoo is good at this. We won’t have any issues.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He had been concerned about potential friction between Seong Jihan and the Warriors due to their previous encounter.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, with Kim Dongwoo welcoming him and Seong Jihan reciprocating the gesture, it seemed there would be no such problems.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘As long as there’s synergy in the Warrior division, we’ll be fine.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Coach Noh Youngjun thought as they entered the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the Southgate map, where up to 30 Warriors can be selected, he first replaced the weakest existing player with Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, they faced an immediate issue.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You don’t have a shield?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, I’ve never used one in the game.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh. Forming the turtle formation requires a shield…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Dongwoo scratched his cheek, looking puzzled.
 </p>
 <p>
  To protect the breached southern gate in the Southgate map, the ideal strategy was for the Warriors to form a special formation called ‘Turtle Formation’.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this formation, Warriors with shields would cluster together, forming a wall-like barrier, which was crucial.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s true… I’ve only seen you use a sword or a spear in your broadcasts.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh. Let’s use this shield then? Anyway, the director probably wants to see the effectiveness of the Turtle Formation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Dongwoo took out a spare shield from his inventory.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a Grade-A Kite Shield.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at it thoughtfully.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘To fully utilize my abilities, I can’t be confined to the defense line.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the warriors, outstanding individuals like the Sword King were given a more flexible role, unlike these main warriors forming the vanguard.
 </p>
 <p>
  In his previous life, Seong Jihan had shown the best performance in America First with such a free role.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even after obtaining the Martial Soul, he felt he deserved that role.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  For now, he prioritized blending into the team.
 </p>
 <p>
  He can prove himself and earn that free role in due time.
 </p>
 <p>
  He graciously accepted the Kite Shield.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though he hadn’t used a shield much even in his past life and wasn’t quite used to it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Should I stand here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, yes. Right there. Now, block this area…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Together with the 30 Warriors, he formed a formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Initially, as Seong Jihan, unfamiliar with the shield, awkwardly took his position, Coach Noh Youngjun thought,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Maybe we shouldn’t deploy Seong Jihan in the 1st and 2nd rounds…’
 </p>
 <p>
  However, once the Turtle Formation was activated,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wha… What is this…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  He was visibly astonished, unable to hide his surprise.
 </p>
 <p>

  [Notes:
 </p>
 <p>
  Automatic door – In the gaming community, especially in competitive games, calling someone an “automatic door” implies that they are so weak or easy to defeat that opponents can just “walk through” them without any resistance, similar to how an automatic door opens easily for anyone approaching. It’s a way to mock someone’s lack of skill or capability in the game.]

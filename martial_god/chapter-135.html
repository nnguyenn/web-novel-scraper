  <strong>
   Chapter 135
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A defense efficiency of… 200%?!’
 </p>
 <p>
  The defense efficiency of the Turtle Formation skyrocketed to an insane level.
 </p>
 <p>
  Previously, the defense efficiency of the national team’s Warrior formation barely ranged from 125 to 140%.
 </p>
 <p>
  When compared to the top-tier national teams whose basic figures hover around 160 to 180%, it’s an incredibly low rate.
 </p>
 <p>
  In reality, even the Korean national team’s highest record of 140% was achieved under perfect conditions, and that too only occasionally during practice.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was typically considered to be around 130%.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘200% is the game’s maximum efficiency for the Turtle Formation!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Smack!
 </p>
 <p>
  Coach Noh Youngjun slapped his own cheek in disbelief.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do it again! Let’s see it again!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Could there have been an error?
 </p>
 <p>
  How could the efficiency surge so significantly just because one player was substituted?
 </p>
 <p>
  But then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s still 200%!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow, this… This efficiency is only known to be achieved by the U.S. national team…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this for real? Seriously, is this for real?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Joy filled Coach Noh Youngjun’s face.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if the defense efficiency was the same, the U.S. team’s 200% and the Korean team’s 200% would still differ in quality.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Given the current state of our team, achieving this is a massive accomplishment!’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Korean national team, which previously couldn’t withstand enemy assaults, now had a fighting chance with this newfound efficiency, enabling their shields to function properly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s 200%! It’s actually 200%!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Huh?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Director, is that even possible? Just because one player changed?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Guys! Come out and see for yourselves! Witness it with your own eyes!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Coach Noh Youngjun shouted excitedly to the Warriors in the practice game.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Warriors who had formed the Turtle Formation logged out with puzzled looks.
 </p>
 <p>
  After checking the replay, they all looked at Seong Jihan with awe.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow… What just happened?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s really 200%?”
 </p>
 <p>
  However, receiving such stares, Seong Jihan tilted his head in confusion.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Wasn’t everyone starting at 200%?’
 </p>
 <p>
  In the future version of the BattleNet game, even the weakest nations achieved the maximum efficiency.
 </p>
 <p>
  The astonishment over just achieving a 200% MAX was incomprehensible to him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan, are you sure it’s your first time holding a shield?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Man, you’re truly a cheat character.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m just glad you’re Korean.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The two players seemed even friendlier than before.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not only them, but other Warriors also began to gather around, trying to engage in a conversation with Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He’s on another level, like the Sword King.’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘We need to establish a rapport with him somehow.’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He seems less prickly than expected.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Being the best players in their country, they quickly recognized Seong Jihan’s caliber.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was at the Sword King level…
 </p>
 <p>
  Or perhaps, even surpassing that.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan, I’ve been a fan of your broadcasts for a long time!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow! It’s truly amazing. How did you achieve 200%?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Surrounded by the Warriors, they eagerly tried to build a rapport with him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright, everyone! Let’s continue with the training!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Clap! Clap!
 </p>
 <p>
  Coach Noh Youngjun clapped his hands, signaling the resumption of training.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, can’t be helped.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll greet him properly during the welcome party.”

 <p>
  Regrettably, the national team Warriors had no choice but to return to their original positions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I noticed earlier that aside from the Warrior position, you can play in multiple slots… You don’t happen to be proficient in archery and magic as well, do you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s keep our conversation informal.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right, earlier, I noticed that you can participate in other position slots too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. I can use all four classes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Seong Jihan had invested all of his skill points into the Warrior class through the All for One system, the other three classes remained.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘All it was for moments like these.’
 </p>
 <p>
  When leveling up alone, he didn’t need the other classes, but they could be strategically useful in national representative-level matches. And Coach Noh Youngjun immediately caught onto this.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, you’re saying you can play a role fitting for each of those classes?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, only the Warrior.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… Even so, depending on the map, we can position you in a relatively less important slot, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  In the current Southgate map, the Warrior is the most crucial, with the role of the archer being the least significant. Thus, placing Seong Jihan in the archer’s position as a Warrior would effectively add one more person to the 30-player slot limit.
 </p>
 <p>
  Coach Noh Youngjun experimented in various ways.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm. When you’re in another position, the Turtle Formation’s efficiency is at 185%…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, it’s a matter of whether we sacrifice that 15% difference or add one more Warrior.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll have to practice more to decide which is better.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Noh Youngjun gazed fondly at the digital representation of Seong Jihan, an insane player who, even when positioned as an archer holding a shield, single-handedly boosted the Turtle Formation’s efficiency by 50%.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I might just keep my position as the coach.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Until a few years ago, Noh Youngjun was hailed as a masterful coach.
 </p>
 <p>
  But ever since Sword King transferred to Japan and Korea couldn’t secure a single win, he faced criticisms, many claiming he had ridden on the Sword King’s coattails.
 </p>
 <p>
  Most anticipated he wouldn’t last in his position past this year.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I never imagined such a godsend would fall from the sky.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Determined to capitalize on the wild card named Seong Jihan, Coach Noh Youngjun decided to summon opponents.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the practice game where the mock battle took place, actual national representative matches were substituted with monster waves.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We held up until the 14th wave!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow. Wasn’t the 10th wave our limit last time?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. With the increased Turtle Formation efficiency and Seong Jihan’s Phoenix Flag’s buff, there’s definitely a noticeable strength boost!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Listening to the enthusiastic analysis, Coach Noh Youngjun nodded in agreement.
 </p>
 <p>
  The significant impact was evident when Seong Jihan activated his Phoenix Flag’s buff just before the waves began.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘At this rate, we might even match Russia!’
 </p>
 <p>
  The addition of just one player felt like a surge in power.
 </p>
 <p>
  And those who felt this more than the staff, were the players who actually participated in the match.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seriously…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even after the Turtle Formation broke, Seong Jihan held on alone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If monsters hadn’t entered, we might have held out for the next wave…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Exactly. Why did the game end just because one monster’s head got in? The judgment is weird.”
 </p>
 <p>
  From the 11th wave, as Warriors began to fall, Seong Jihan held his ground firmly. It felt as if he could have held on alone until the next wave if not for the game’s end criteria.
 </p>
 <p>
  “He’s insane…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s about time we got some respect.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The training atmosphere was filled with warmth and camaraderie.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since the Sword King’s transfer and the national team’s inability to secure a win, today’s practice results were a beacon of hope.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright, let’s wrap up the practice for today.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, the first training session with the addition of Seong Jihan concluded with great success.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Click! Click!
 </p>
 <p>
  At the press conference for the national team, more journalists than usual gathered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “As you can see, our first training session was highly successful.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A 14th wave? Just by adding Seong Jihan, you’ve surpassed the previous record by four waves?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The interviewing journalist seemed to find it hard to comprehend, tilting his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that even possible?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan is strong, but he’s just one player.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t the 14th wave similar to China’s record?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right. I believe Russia’s record is the 13th wave.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Japan’s Sword King managed to go up to the 18th wave on his own.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That guy is off the charts.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The journalists, discussing records of other countries, couldn’t hide their astonishment.

 <p>
  How could the Korean team, which struggled to reach even the 10th wave, now stand shoulder to shoulder with China’s record just by changing one player?ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels
 </p>
 <p>
  “I wish we could release footage of the practice game, hahaha.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, can we expect a victory in the upcoming match against Russia?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Coach Noh Youngjun then glanced at Seong Jihan, who was seated next to him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. This guy here will do it all for us.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Coach Noh Youngjun then enthusiastically praised Seong Jihan’s gameplay, expressing that he had integrated well with the team.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan! Coach Noh Youngjun rarely gives such high praise, so the expectations for you are immense. What’s your mindset for the upcoming match against Russia?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, looking towards the journalist he had just spoken to, asked, “You mentioned that the Russian Warriors reached the 13th wave, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, it’ll be an easy win. We could have gone to the 15th wave if not for that demon’s neck falling inwards.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Saying that, Seong Jihan held up three fingers.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If Russia’s skills are at that level, we’ll beat them 3:0.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “3… 3:0?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Team Russia.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though Western Russia was considered more potent than the East, the East still had considerable strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  With China and Japan dominating Northeast Asia, and Russia positioned just below them followed by Taiwan and Korea, the Eastern Russian team was acknowledged to have enough prowess to be categorized as a ‘strong’ team in other regional leagues.
 </p>
 <p>
  But for Seong Jihan to declare a 3:0 victory over such a team…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Wow. I have to include this statement.’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Classic Seong Jihan. Drawing massive attention!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Journalists immediately published articles featuring Seong Jihan’s bold statement.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon after, a photo of Seong Jihan holding up three fingers became the top image on portal sites.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  – 3:0??
 </p>
 <p>
  – Against Russia…??
 </p>
 <p>
  – Is it true Korea reached the 14th wave? They need to release the practice footage, lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Why should they? Just believe it.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Please, I hope we win 3:0… even 3:2 is fine.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Are we finally going to get a win?
 </p>
 <p>
  – It’s not even Taiwan; Russia is just ridiculous. Just because Seong Jihan joined, suddenly? That doesn’t make any sense, lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Yes~ It’s possible because it’s Seong Jihan~~
 </p>
 <p>
  The public’s response exploded instantly. The attention was already on Seong Jihan’s debut game with the team.
 </p>
 <p>
  The news of them clearing up to the 14th wave, combined with Seong Jihan’s bold 3:0 declaration against Russia, was bound to be a sensation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow, the reactions are explosive.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s the first time I’ve seen a news piece about the national team without hate comments, bro.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After the interview concluded, Kim Dongwoo and Lee Yoongi checked real-time reactions on their phones, laughing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Usually, any news related to the national team was flooded with hate comments, but today, the declaration and the 14th wave achievement diverted all the attention.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, thanks to Jihan. He consumed all the attention. Thanks, man.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s just something obvious.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “3:0?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Seriously? The Russians are insane berserkers. They come charging with their eyes flipped, swinging axes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then we’ll just knock them down.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan responded as if it was a straightforward matter.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Wow. He’s serious.’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It feels like watching Sejin…no, the Sword King from back then….’
 </p>
 <p>
  When the Sword King, Yoon Sejin, was on the national team, he had a similar attitude.
 </p>
 <p>
  That one? Just defeat it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whenever Kim Dongwoo was worried about how to beat the opposition, Sword King would brush it off so easily.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, Seong Jihan’s demeanor mirrored that.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Looking at him… he seems even stronger than the Sword King.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sword King, Yoon Sejin, wasn’t this powerful during his gold days.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to get closer to him quickly.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Fortunately, he seemed more approachable than expected…
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Dongwoo decided he needed to foster a closer bond with him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jihan, the Warriors organized a small welcome party for you… How about it? Can you join us for drinks tonight?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Slyly looking around, he whispered to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ve also invited some celebrities and announcers. Top idols too. They all adjusted their schedules because they wanted to see you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Dongwoo invited him to a pre-planned party.

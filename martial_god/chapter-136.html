  <strong>
   Chapter 136
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan doubted his ears.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Celebrities and announcers? This doesn’t sound like a modest welcome party.’
 </p>
 <p>
  This seemed more like a grand booze party.
 </p>
 <p>
  And they’re planning such a thing when there are only a few days left before the national match?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is quite different from when I was in the US.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, back then, many countries were actually collapsing, and the current situation wasn’t as tense.
 </p>
 <p>
  The US team’s schedule was fundamentally rigorous.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It wasn’t like now, practicing only 3-4 hours. The standard was 12 hours.’
 </p>
 <p>
  On top of that, if one’s stamina dropped, not only would the B-team supporters step up to take care, but there were also sessions for opponent team power analysis and strategy briefings.
 </p>
 <p>
  Every game was approached as if it were the start of a war.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, without having won a single game and with warriors who were essentially at the heart of those defeats, they wanted to throw a booze party on the first day?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Their mindset has gone rotten.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Although it was under the guise of a welcome party, the actual intention was pretty distasteful.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan waved his hand, immediately declining the offer.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m fine, thanks. I have to look after my niece.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, but…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, bro! Ha Yoori is also coming!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who is she?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You don’t know Ha Yoori of South Korea…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Her, look!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Yoongi swiftly searched something on his smartphone and showed him a picture of Ha Yoori. The screen displayed a top star often seen in TV commercials, smiling radiantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve seen her on TV.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes! Despite being so popular, she’s coming just to see you!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Tell her not to come. I can’t make it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jihan… Please, just for today, can’t you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even when Ha Yoori was mentioned, he refused!
 </p>
 <p>
  Is he even a guy?
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Dongwoo was dumbfounded, but still, out of desperation, showed Seong Jihan photos of several female celebrities, begging him earnestly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha Yoori isn’t the only one. She’s coming, and she is, and her as well…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can’t.”
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Seong Jihan firmly declined and turned away.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m not free because of yesterday’s event. Please understand.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… okay then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Feeling the sudden coldness from Seong Jihan, Kim Dongwoo couldn’t persuade him any further.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once Seong Jihan had completely left the interview venue,
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Dongwoo finally began to grumble.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Gosh, is he impotent or what?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ughhh. Given what happened yesterday…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I know… Damn it. When he became stern, I got goosebumps.”ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh… Honestly, I was a bit scared too. He’s indeed on a different level.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even the national team warriors, who had never felt intimidated in the past, felt confined. They had an instinctive fear that any further persuasion would jeopardize their newly formed relationship.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, no… It’s his fault. But what are we to do now? I’ve invited some difficult-to-find people, and they’re very excited.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Um…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Yoongi paused for a moment before devising a strategy.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s just say Jihan will join later due to yesterday’s incident. By the time he joins, everyone will be tipsy and probably won’t remember, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Maybe?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Once they’re drunk, it’s over. Besides, our specs aren’t weak either way?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “True that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, Kim Dongwoo decided to host the welcome party for Seong Jihan without him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ??
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, Seong Jihan headed to the BattleNet center’s private practice room with Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan could directly log into BattleNet, Yoon Seah needed a connector, which was the reason for visiting the practice room.
 </p>
 <p>
  “May I use the BattleNet connector?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, of course!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon, Sophia, who was in the US, joined, and the three formed a team.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This mission’s objective is ‘Invade’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You are part of the Demonic Faction.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jihan! I saw the interview. Did you really hold on till the 14th wave?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. We could’ve cleared the 15th, but it was unfortunate.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow… I want to see the footage… But they won’t release it, will they?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Maybe after the Russia game. Not before that, though.”
 </p>
 <p>
  While Sophia expressed interest in Seong Jihan’s records, she soon turned her attention to Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah, so what have you decided about the class change?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh, about that…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, Seong Jihan cut her off.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah, you discussed the class change with Sophia?”
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  “Yeah. About becoming a Void Archer. I shared my thoughts with Sophia since I was unsure…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Void Archer.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re willing to take the risk despite Ariel’s warning?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. I want to become stronger quickly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, Seong Jihan nodded in agreement.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It seems the recent incident had a significant impact on her.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps it was due to the incident where she was almost kidnapped by Shizuru.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah’s eyes were filled with determination, even if it was tinged with anger.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her determination to grow stronger was palpable, even if it meant taking such risks.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan made the decision to respect her decision.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, if that’s your decision, you should stick with it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, yes! Please wait for me! Uncle, I’m going to surpass you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Be content with being second.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll never lose to that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s better than giving you false hope.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She can’t beat Muhon as a Void Archer.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the two were chatting, they received a message from the opposing team.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Argh— it’s Jihan…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [We’re unlucky to face him todayㅜㅜ]
 </p>
 <p>
  [I guess we’ll just sit at our base~~^^]
 </p>
 <p>
  The players from the Angel Faction immediately gave up and stayed at their base upon seeing Seong Jihan’s name.
 </p>
 <p>
  This had become a common occurrence since Seong Jihan reached the gold level.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m farming minions for levels.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sophia, cover Seah as well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sure~ Miss, let’s go~!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Miss?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You told me ‘Miss’ is what you call a younger sister-in-law in Korea.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But, I mean…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s the same thing~.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked incredulous at Sophia’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  She seems more severe than her previous life.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he pondered whether it was wise for the three of them to play together, the opposing players started chatting with him from their base.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Jihan! How was being on the national team?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [It was full of good people.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [I heard you’re having a star-studded welcome party today. Are you certain you should be playing right now?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [I declined the party because of yesterday’s incident. My level is the lowest, so I need to level up.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [So, leveling up… haha…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [So you deliberately played during the time Jihan was online…]
 </p>
 <p>
  The opposing players felt dejected by Seong Jihan’s response.
 </p>
 <p>
  They had hoped that after he joined the national team, he might attend the welcome party and not be available for games.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should play a bit longer today.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to extend the game so that Yoon Seah, who had switched classes to Void Archer, could adjust properly.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, instead of quickly farming the jungle and buffing his team, he simply relaxed and monitored the situation, much like the opposing team.
 </p>
 <p>
  Three hours passed in this manner.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Just push and end it… it’s tortureㅜㅜ]
 </p>
 <p>
  [What are you doing ㅠㅠ]
 </p>
 <p>
  Around the time when the opposing team’s players grew impatient, one of them messaged:
 </p>
 <p>
  [Jihan! You might want to finish the game. I received a notification that something happened at the BattleNet center?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [What?]
 </p>
 <p>
  At the welcome party, a major incident had occurred.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this true?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Director Noh Youngjun trembled with anger.
 </p>
 <p>
  “One of our players assaulted Ha Yoori and she’s critically injured…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes… Fortunately, a supportive player who got the call came in time and treated her. But she hasn’t regained consciousness.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That damn fool! Who did this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It was… Player Yoon Jeonghyun.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Jeonghyun had been the strongest warrior next to Kim Dongwoo before Seong Jihan’s arrival. However, he was widely known for his bad temper and fondness for women.
 </p>
 <p>
  No one expected him to go as far as attacking a woman, let alone a top star like Ha Yoori.
 </p>
 <p>
  “And Kim Dongwoo, who said they were just having a small drinking party…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They apparently invited many celebrities for a booze party to welcome Seong Jihan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Was Seong Jihan involved?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, he was playing on BattleNet at the time. The assault apparently occurred when Ha Yoori said she would leave because Seong Jihan wasn’t there, and Yoon Jeonghyun lost his temper…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This damn idiot!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Warrior players are human weapons.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially if they’re at the national representative level.
 </p>
 <p>
  To think one would attack a civilian…
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s a miracle she’s still alive.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Any chance for a settlement?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “About that… Ha Yoori is the younger sister of player Ha Yeonjoo. And right now, Ha Yeonjoo is livid, and we’re barely holding her back from killing Yoon Jeonghyun…”
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Ha Yeonjoo, the leader of the national representative Archers, was the top player in Korea with the highest level. Her position in the national team was incomparable to Yoon Jeonghyun’s.
 </p>
 <p>
  “… Did that fool know he was attacking Ha Yeonjoo’s sister?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He claims he only held her back, and she somehow got hurt… he feels he’s been wronged.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Damn it, the real problem is that he used force against a civilian!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  Director Noh Youngjun slammed his desk, unable to contain his anger.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had turned a blind eye to the drinking, but causing such a mess was inexcusable.
 </p>
 <p>
  Assaulting a celebrity, especially a top star like Ha Yoori?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I want to get rid of them all…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Noh Youngjun felt a strong urge to drink.
 </p>
 <p>
  His reputation had plummeted after continuous losses since the departure of the Sword King.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Dongwoo, who used to be obedient, had brazenly brought dozens of outsiders for a party, defying his earlier promise.
 </p>
 <p>
  And now, this catastrophic event has taken place.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So… Director, what should we do…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The analyst beside him was pacing anxiously, but Noh Youngjun was devoid of ideas.
 </p>
 <p>
  The national team was already out of his control.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps he should just resign and bear the full responsibility for this incident.
 </p>
 <p>
  That was the only thought swirling in his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Director.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ha Yeonjoo, the leader of the Archer squad, entered his office.
 </p>
 <p>
  She was known as one of Korea’s beautiful sisters alongside her top-star sibling Ha Yoori, and she made a final demand with a stern expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Those who participated in the drinking session today, dismiss them all. Or else, the entire Archer squad will boycott the national games.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What? All? Isn’t Yoon Jeonghyun the main problem? Why everyone…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can’t forgive those who just stood by and watched while my sister was assaulted.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But, the match against Russia is just a few days away. Dismissing all the warriors…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not all, just the 12 who attended the second drinking session.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dismissing 12 warriors or the entire Archer squad would boycott the game?
 </p>
 <p>
  Noh Youngjun felt trapped.
 </p>
 <p>
  But, with Seong Jihan’s recent addition, there was finally hope for a win.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, all this mess over some random welcome party?
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s happening?”
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment, Seong Jihan, who had finished his game, entered the director’s office.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ha Yeonjoo glared at him, her arms crossed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though he hadn’t attended the party, her sister had attended and got hurt because of it. Naturally, she wasn’t happy.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Why is she acting like this towards me?’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan looked puzzled,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Earlier… that’s… ”
 </p>
 <p>
  The director gave a brief overview of the situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hearing it, Ha Yeonjoo gritted her teeth and said,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, I can’t be on the national team with your teammates. All the Archers share this sentiment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recalled the members of the warrior squad.
 </p>
 <p>
  They weren’t essential, but they weren’t completely useless either.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay, can I still be on the team even if my teammates aren’t?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, you didn’t attend the drinking session, so…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright, Director.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan spoke confidently.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Dismiss the twelve of them. Actually, dismiss those who attended the first drinking session too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What? You… I can understand about Yoon Jeonghyun, but dismissing everyone means we’ll have no warriors left! Only second-tier players remain!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I alone defended till the 14th wave earlier.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The director was rendered speechless.
 </p>
 <p>
  That was correct.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t want to sync up with teammates who tarnished my name.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Um… well…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Or I can leave the team.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At that, Ha Yeonjoo looked at Seong Jihan in surprise.
 </p>
 <p>
  She had wanted to dismiss those who attended the first drinking session, but she hadn’t expected Seong Jihan to suggest it himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  She felt guilty for having glared at him earlier.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her anger subsided slightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan and the Archer squad vs. the troublesome warrior squad.
 </p>
 <p>
  When weighing the options, the balance clearly tilted to the left.
 </p>
 <p>
  Noh Youngjun gave up on trying to reconcile.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Even if we lose against Russia, it’s better to have discipline…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Up until that moment, he had given up on the upcoming match.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, as time went by and the national team match began,
 </p>
 <p>
  – There was an unfortunate incident in the national team, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Yes… it’s regrettable. Director Noh Youngjun took strict measures and dismissed all the primary warrior players. There was a lot of public criticism.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Yes, many wondered who would play the games if all the warriors were dismissed. But today, Director Noh Youngjun seems more confident than usual.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Indeed. In an interview yesterday, he confidently stated they would win…
 </p>
 <p>
  – I hope that’s true!
 </p>
 <p>
  Director Noh Youngjun’s face was filled with confidence.
 </p>
 <p>
  The source of that confidence was due to one person.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This guy is insane.’
 </p>
 <p>
  At the top of the national team list, he had first written the name Seong Jihan.

  Chapter 140
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m sorry about the last time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you talking about?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It wasn’t because of Seong Jihan, But I was irritated…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Was she referring to the incident in the coach’s office when she glared at him during the Ha Yoori assault case?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan responded casually, “It’s okay. It was because of your younger sister, so I understand.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s sweet of you to say. But… can you do me a favor?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A favor?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. I’m really sorry, but could you please accompany me to visit Yoori? She’s been feeling so guilty and depressed. She thinks that our Russian match was ruined because of her.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But the outcome was favorable, wasn’t it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, yes, but…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Top star Ha Yoori. Ha Yeonjoo knew well about her sister’s popularity. She was the most successful actress of the 21st century, and her innocent beauty was more important for her success than her acting skills, especially in the Asian market. Given Ha Yoori’s overwhelming popularity among men, Ha Yeonjoo expected Seong Jihan to agree to go with her easily.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Seong Jihan quickly declined, “I’m sorry, but I have to go level up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay, so… you won’t go?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ha Yeonjoo hesitated for a moment and then spoke up, “I’m really sorry, but I can’t just let this go. Yoori feels really guilty and depressed, thinking that she ruined the match because of her. Can you please come just once?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan responded with a firm rejection, and Ha Yeonjoo seemed flustered. However, someone (Seah) was watching from behind.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, Uncle. It’s just leveling up. You can go and do it later. You should go and visit her~”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, really? You’re right. But I have a lot of stuff, and You and Akari got things on you as well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stuff? It’s fine. I’ll prepare a limousine for you!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ha Yeonjoo was determined to get Seong Jihan so she offered to prepare a limousine for him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the large limousine that Ha Yeonjoo had arranged.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah, don’t be afraid to use training items to improve your accuracy. It’s not just that you can’t use it. In fact, trying them out allows you to compare and adjust.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, I see, Unnie! I was really curious about that…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ha Yeonjoo and Yoon Seah had so much to talk about that their conversation showed no sign of stopping.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, Akari kept quiet and stayed Alert.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan had little to say, so he said a few things and Thought about Ha Yeonjoo from his previous life.
 </p>
 <p>
  She had the S-Class gift, ‘Concentrated Sniping’.
 </p>
 <p>
  “When she hit the target, there was a significant adjustment effect on her teammates’ accuracy and damage. That’s why she was so essential for the Korean archers.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Korean archer team’s main feature was its concentrated shooting, which effectively incapacitated opponents individually. Ha Yeonjoo’s Gift was the key to this strategy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan remembered how he had analyzed Ha Yeonjoo’s Gift when she was a brilliant Archer of the Space League. She was the best Archer in the world. However, her Gift was not Gold-tier back then.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, when she hits the target, her teammates’ accuracy and damage receive a considerable bonus.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yeonjoo’s Gift was the core of the Korean archer team’s strategies in team matches.
 </p>
 <p>
  “After she retired from Space League, the Korean national team which was still kinda strong (Mid), plummeted further.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Space League matches featured the best players from around the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The team became weaker after she retired.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ha Yeonjoo was also chosen to be an Archer. She died during the match against the Elves.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the game, death can be resurrected with GP.
 </p>

 <p>
  But… She made a big mistake during the first season of Space League, which was organized by the World BattleNet Association.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because many of the top players died in their matches against the Elves, their absence had a significant impact later on. The disaster in the first season was the primary reason the Earth’s league ranking remained at the bottom.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha Yeonjoo, this time I won’t let talented people die.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Since he had returned, he couldn’t let the Stinky Elves manipulate them twice.
 </p>
 <p>
  While thinking about how to deal with the Elves in Space League, the car suddenly stopped in front of a hospital.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ve arrived.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Manager, what is Yoori doing right now? Is she sleeping? Oh, she was watching the match? Yes, please let her know that we’re coming up together with a guest.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ha Yeonjoo made a call to Ha Yoori’s manager.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shall we go then?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan and the others got out of the car. Immediately, more than ten bodyguards emerged from the front and rear cars and surrounded them.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You have quite a few people.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Without bodyguards, daily life is impossible for me. I don’t have a presence like you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Ha Yeonjoo had said, all eyes were focused on her as she entered the hospital, even though it was a VIP ward with few people.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow, it’s Ha Yeonjoo… She looks more like a goddess in person.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan is here too?!”
 </p>

 <p>
  “What’s going on? Why are they suddenly at the hospital?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you think they’ll give us an autograph if we ask for one?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But with bodyguards, it’s impossible to get close.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though it was a VIP ward and had few people, onlookers quickly gathered. Among them, many were doctors and nurses.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You can’t do anything without bodyguards nowdays.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded. He had seen similar scenes while living in the United States.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It was even crazier back then. Fans were more enthusiastic.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In the time when Dungeon Threats became a reality, players were not just sports stars but were also responsible for national defense. Even with bodyguards, fans managed to approach and ask for autographs or selfies. Compared to those days, the current reaction was relatively tame.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your Unnie, YeonJoo, is here. Seong Jihan is here too, as well as his Niece Yoon Seah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What? Why did they come to the hospital all of a sudden?!” Yoori exclaimed suddenly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Manager, Close the door!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The manager was surprised, and quickly closed it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How did you end up bringing him here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, it just happened…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  After a secretive whisper in Ha Yeonjoo’s ear, the manager hurriedly entered the room.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait, Manager. Where are you going? I want to go in first!”
 </p>
 <p>
  In a rush, Ha Yeonjoo entered the room.
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as she entered, Ha Yeonjoo exclaimed loudly:
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey! Ha Yoori! You knew we were waiting! How rude, making us wait?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, I got it, Unnie! It’s all done! I was just putting on some lipstick!” Yoori said while hurriedly looking at the mirror.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha! What’s with this ‘patient’… Just go with your bare face, why the heavy makeup?” Yeonjoo sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Geez, Being a player has blessed you with great skin Unnie! Normal people can’t help it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Fine, fine, you’re beautiful.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehe, thanks. I learned a lot of tips from my Unnie.”
 </p>
 <p>
  While talking to Ha Yoori, Ha Yeonjoo appeared with a tired expression.
 </p>

 <p>
  “I’m really sorry, Seong Jihan. Let’s go in now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Is it finally time to enter? As Seong Jihan and Yoon Seah entered, Ha Yoori stood beside the bed and greeted them at a 90-degree angle.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dressed in a hospital gown, her full makeup didn’t quite fit, but she looked absolutely beautiful, just like in the TV commercials.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s nice to meet you for the first time, Seong Jihan-Ssi.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey! You! Why is a sick person standing up and bowing to me?!” Seong Jihan stepped back with a weird expression on his face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How dare I lay down while meeting you, Mr. Seong Jihan?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah…?” Seong Jihan sighed weakly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes… I’m your biggest fan! I’m actually ‘DownGlass’ who always keeps shouting your name during your BattleTube streams, I never miss your streams, I’m also the one who keeps sending you GP, Maybe you don’t know about me? Ah look at me I’m blabbing, I’m so happy I’m happy, UHHH, I’m just so happy you came to visit me, that too a hospital visit, even If I die now, I’ll be content.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At first, she tried to control her tone, but she couldn’t contain her excitement and started pouring out her words like a storm. Her body was trembling with excitement.
 </p>
 <p>
  “For now, lie down. You’re about to collapse.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How dare I lie down to meet Mr. Seong Jihan!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Sigh. I wish this was a dream. This is…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ha Yeonjoo, after letting out a deep sigh, approached Ha Yoori and covered her with a blanket.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan watched her and decided to focus on the purpose of this hospital visit.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you okay? I heard you were in an accident because of me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh my god, no sir, It wasn’t because of you!!! That fool was trying to make me drink forcefully, and then I got into an accident. Seong Jihan-Ssi has done nothing wrong! Besides, I’m all better now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ha Yoori looked at Seong Jihan with a happy expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Meeting you in person, my worries and concerns have all disappeared. I feel like I can fly to the sky.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t that dangerous…” Jihan said while sighing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh! Yoon Seah! I’m also subscribed to her channel!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Subscribed?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I told Unnie about it, right? A super rookie is threatening her position~!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A-Ahaha, U-uhm, I’m not that good yet…” Seah said shyly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh no. I’m sure of it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  She confidently pointed at her own eyes. “I have a ‘Gift’ too!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s called ‘Emotions'”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yoori! S-Stop…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ha Yeonjoo tried to cover her mouth to stop her, but her words had already piqued Seong Jihan’s interest.
 </p>
 <p>
  A ‘Gift’ related to support… Is this what Ha Yoori possesses?
 </p>
 <p>
  “However, isn’t this ability a bit vague?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Emotions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought of it as an ability that merely showed hidden item descriptions. Compared to Lee Hayeon’s ‘Nurturing’ or Shizuru’s ‘Edit’, its value seemed significantly lower.
 </p>
 <p>
  But…
 </p>
 <p>
  “With this ability, I can also gauge a player’s potential to some extent!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ha Yoori claimed that with her Emotion ability, she could see a player’s potential.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought to himself, ‘It has to be B-Grade at least.’
 </p>
 <p>
  B-grade support gifts were rare on Earth. Seong Jihan’s eyes gleamed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It seems that people should go with their gut feeling.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Wasn’t that the reason they found such talents? Seong Jihan considered that he had made a wise decision by visiting the hospital and stared intently at Ha Yoori.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehe…”
 </p>
 <p>
  She laughed, seemingly unaware of Seong Jihan’s quick assessment, just giggling at his expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Are you an idiot?”
 </p>
 <p>
  She didn’t even notice her older sister’s reaction, to the point that she couldn’t bear to look at her.

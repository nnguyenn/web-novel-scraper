  Chapter 143
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jihan-nim!! You were so amazing today!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as Seong Jihan logged out, he couldn’t help but smile at Ha Yoori’s enthusiastic welcome.
 </p>
 <p>
  Was there a cool scene today?
 </p>
 <p>
  In fact, today’s broadcast probably had the most intense moments among all the broadcasts so far.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan wondered if his thoughts were correct, as the expressions of others, including Yoon Seah and Ha Yeonjoo, didn’t seem very pleasant.
 </p>
 <p>
  The high tension was all thanks to Ha Yoori.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Today’s broadcast must have been tough to watch. Are you okay?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh no~ I was so thrilled when Jihan-nim effortlessly took down the elf with a single blow!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  You liked that scene?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even such a beautiful elf being cut down with a single strike… that determination is something else! I suddenly remembered what happened at the last welcome party.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You mean the welcome party I didn’t attend?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, that’s the one. Honestly, I felt relieved inside because you weren’t there, Jihan-nim.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why is that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This person is a bit strange…?’ Seah thought while looking at Yoori.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I hoped you, my idol, wouldn’t come to the pre-game drinking party, seeing regular folks like us. So, when you didn’t show up for the first round and broadcast the game, I was secretly happy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, I see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If that’s the case, why did you even come to the drinking party?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at Ha Yeonjoo with an indescribable expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re quite an unusual person,” Seah said it out loud this time.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh no, Yoori. Is something wrong with your head?” Yeonjoo looked incredulous.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you talking about? I’ve always thought this way! Right, Manager Sis~~?”
 </p>
 <p>
  For a moment, Seong Jihan considered hiding the World Tree Leaf, thinking he was in some strange situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, are you really okay?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes…? Yes! I’m perfectly fine!” Yoori said enthusiastically.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll believe you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan took out the World Tree Leaf from his inventory.
 </p>
 <p>
  [World Tree Leaf]
 </p>
 <p>
  Grade: S
 </p>
 <p>
  -A leaf from the World Tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  A one-line, extremely concise item description.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the item’s grade itself was by no means weak.
 </p>
 <p>
  But if it was around S-grade, she could easily discern more about this item with her emotional abilities.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can you appraise this item for me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, your physical condition…” Yeonjoo was about to stop her…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Emotion!”
 </p>
 <p>
  After receiving the leaf from Seong Jihan, Ha Yoori used the Gift immediately, without listening to her sister’s objections.
 </p>
 <p>
  And not long after that…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh…! This is an amazing item, isn’t it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Along with Ha Yoori’s admiration, the World Tree Leaf she received again had a considerably different description.
 </p>
 <p>
  [World Tree Leaf]
 </p>
 <p>
  Grade: S
 </p>
 <p>
  -A leaf from the World Tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Heals abnormalities and restores vitality.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Shows maximum effect when consumed without processing, and more than half of the leaf must be consumed to take effect.
 </p>
 <p>
  -When the entire leaf is consumed, the health stat increases by 3.
 </p>
 <p>
  -This effect does not stack.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Not only does it boost your health… But it works even if you eat just half?’ This item was so exceptional that it seemed like S-grade had been an understatement.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rare items permanently increasing stats to this extent were scarce.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is probably better than any potion in the world.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan gestured to Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Eat this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is this…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah received the leaf from Seong Jihan, looked at the description, and her eyes widened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No. Uncle, isn’t this… an item with effects for Dad? Why should I eat it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have one more.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan took another leaf out of his inventory and put it back.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You were charmed by Shizuru too, right? You didn’t resist it completely.” Seah still tried to deny it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah? I did resist… with the Lightning Mark.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, you should definitely eat this. Besides, look at the effect of this leaf. It increases your health by 3, right? Just eat it.” Seong Jihan still urged Seah to eat it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, I’m really fine. Uncle should eat it. It increases stats!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m fine too.”
 </p>

 <p>
  Yoon Seah, who had been about to vigorously applaud Seong Jihan’s words, glanced at Akari lying in the corner of the hospital room and cautiously spoke up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then… let’s cut it in half and share it with Akari.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What? Why her?” Seong Jihan questioned her.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If I wasn’t able to resist ‘Charm’ completely, then Akari is in the same boat, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Are you willing to give up 3 health points?” Seong Jihan asked Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. I’ll find another leaf for myself later. Hehe.”
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how much Akari had turned to their side, it was still a valuable item to share.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Surely, the remnants of Shizuru might still linger in her.”
 </p>
 <p>

  *****
 </p>
 <p>
  As much as it was regrettable to lose 3 health points, it was better than getting stabbed in the back later.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan approached Akari and released the acupuncture.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Uh… Mom?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  Akari, with the acupuncture released, had tears streaming down her cheeks with a puzzled expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, Mom. It wasn’t me. That wasn’t me…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you talking about?”
 </p>
 <p>
  It was an unexpected sight. As he looked at Akari with such watery eyes, Ariel heaved a sigh and explained the reason.
 </p>
 <p>
  [She had another nightmare, it seems. For the past few days, she’s hardly been able to sleep. Whenever she closes her eyes, she recalls the faces of her deceased parents, whom she believes she killed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It looks like she might even attempt suicide soon.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “If that happens, report it to me immediately.” Seong Jihan told Ariel.
 </p>
 <p>
  [She hasn’t attempted it yet.]
 </p>
 <p>
  With her current mental state, it’s definitely better to follow Seah’s advice and share the leaf. Akari will be a necessary presence when dealing with Shizuru later.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah, take half of the leaf and give it to her.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah approached Akari.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Um…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aaaah! Aaaah… Ah. Was it a dream?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Have this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Without warning, Seah tore off half of the leaf and handed it to Akari, then immediately put the remaining half in her own mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh… it tastes bad.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Zap! Zap!
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, a green light briefly flickered from her entire body. Above her head, a black smoke rose slightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh… it’s just as you said, uncle, Effects are real!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why? Did something come up in the system message?” Jihan asked Yoon Seah
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. It says the abnormal condition, ‘charm,’ has been completely removed… Wow, I was still under its influence. No wonder I kept thinking of Shizuru’s face before going to sleep.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You… should have told me about this sooner.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s just me! I thought it was because she’s so pretty… Hehe.” Seah said while laughing embarrassingly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘She was deeply rooted in that.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a stroke of luck that he gave it to her, just in case.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, Akari, who had been looking at the leaf, shook all over when she read the item description.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey… are you really giving such an incredible thing to me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, be grateful to Seah. She gave up 3 stat points.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really… Uncle brought it for me, and you act like it’s nothing. Akari, this is all thanks to Uncle.”𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  “Eating this will make me feel sorry…” Akari said with her head down
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s okay. Eat it. You need to get rid of the abnormal condition to take revenge on Shizuru, right?” Seah encouraged her to eat it.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Akari heard the word ‘revenge’ through Ariel’s translation, she lowered her gaze.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I see. I will be in your debt.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Crunch! Crunch!
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike the way Yoon Seah swallowed it, Akari chewed the leaf slowly, one bite at a time.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was truly a case of perseverance and determination.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crunch!, crunch!
 </p>
 <p>
  Chewing and grinding, how long had the sound filled the hospital room?
 </p>
 <p>
  Zap!
 </p>
 <p>
  Just like Yoon Seah a little while ago, a green light flickered over Akari’s entire body, and smoke rose above her head. However, the difference was that the amount of rising black smoke was much greater than Yoon Seah’s.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Shizuru’s traces were deeply ingrained like that.’
 </p>
 <p>
  At the same time, her face, which had been haggard from the lack of sleep, began to regain vitality.
 </p>
 <p>
  “My head… feels refreshed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She mumbled with a trembling voice and then knelt before Seong Jihan and Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You gave me such an item so readily… Thank you very much. I will repay this favor with my life.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, it’s okay…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you saying? She must repay it. Do you know how valuable this leaf is?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan said firmly. Giving up such a precious health status was not something to be taken lightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Help us with the NIS work in the future, besides that, please protect Seah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I understand! I will protect the young lady with my life!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Learn Korean quickly too. Translation is inconvenient.” Jihan sighed and spoke to her.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Akari, who had become much healthier, roared with enthusiasm, Yoon Seah had a somewhat touched expression on her face.
 </p>

 <p>
  ‘She’s 200% sincere.’
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow, Seah! Congratulations! You’ve got a Diamond-level bodyguard.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan played the game, Ha Yoori, who had decided to get along as sisters, was the first to applaud.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right. We had an incident like this before, so it’s best to be as cautious as possible. If she’s an assassin class, she’s perfect as a bodyguard.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ha Yeonjoo also nodded as if things were going well.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay… Akari, please take care of us.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Yoon Seah extended her hand for a handshake, Akari politely joined her hands and shook hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, she moved to her rear, already switching to bodyguard mode.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm, she’s more enthusiastic than I thought.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who initially felt reluctant to give the leaf, changed his mind when he saw this. Getting a Diamond-class ninja as a bodyguard with just half a leaf was a good deal.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well then…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan smiled as he looked at Ha Yoori.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Could you give me your number?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes! Here you go! I wrote it down in advance!” Yoori said while blushing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing her younger sister hand a note confidently, Ha Yeonjoo sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I didn’t expect her to be this competent… I shouldn’t have brought Seong Jihan for no reason.’
 </p>
 <p>
  She kinda regretted asking Seong Jihan to come for a visit after the national team’s match.
 </p>
 <p>
  *****
 </p>
 <p>
  -If you ever need to use my gift ‘Emotions’, feel free to contact me! I’ll run to you wherever you are! Oh, should I join your guild? After finishing filming this drama and shooting 10 CFs, I won’t have any schedules for a while~
 </p>
 <p>
  -Are you crazy? Absolutely not! Seong Jihan, please. A guild, really? You know how much she suffered to get this far in the entertainment industry! She won’t be able to handle a guild!
 </p>
 <p>
  -It’s okay! I’ve achieved my goal since I reached the top! I can retire after this!
 </p>
 <p>
  -Quiet!
 </p>
 <p>
  Due to Ha Yeonjoo’s desperate opposition, Ha Yoori’s guild membership was put on hold. Seong Jihan, while tempted by Ha Yoori’s emotional abilities, didn’t feel the need to have her join the guild. With someone this friendly, he could contact her when necessary.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll go teach Akari Korean!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ariel, too. We need an interpreter.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sure.” Jihan agreed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon arriving at the penthouse, Yoon Seah led the rest of the group to her room.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Today has been quite eventful.’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘From the Russian national team game to the closure of the survival map. Just the achievement points earned today added up to 370,000, and my level has risen by 9. Seong Jihan checked his level and remaining points.’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Level 89. I think I might be able to promote to Platinum this month.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was growing at an even faster pace than before, despite reaching Gold. This was possible because, unlike other players, being in the national team games was an opportunity for leveling up. Furthermore, he had gained a staggering 19 stat points throughout the day, all thanks to the Seed of Life.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘All right, I’m going all in on points.’
 </p>
 <p>
  There were rare stats like ‘Shadow Sword’ or ‘Thunder Seal,’ but Seong Jihan didn’t hesitate and invested all his remaining points in ‘Martial Soul.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [Martial Soul has grown to a value of 110.]
 </p>
 <p>
  {TL/N: As his martial arts prowess grew, he was able to invest some points in martial soul after it got stuck in chapter 131}
 </p>
 <p>
  [Martial Soul’s growth limit has increased to 130.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Exchange/Practice your martial arts to suit yourself and enhance Martial Soul.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You cannot invest any more points until martial soul reaches 130.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘In the end, there’s a limit to point investment. I’ll have to start modifying my martial arts.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan began reviewing his possessed martial arts.
 </p>
 <p>
  First, the basic skill, ‘Triad of martial mastery,’ remained untouched.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I use Striking Thunderbolt mixed with Pheonix Fire. It’ll significantly enhance its power.’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘‘The dark shadow technique: Dark soul vertex still lacks modification clues, and total annihilation has reached its limit at this level.’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘‘I’d like to use only the Blood Cross’s ‘Instant Death’, but it’s not possible at this level.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In summary, the only martial art he could modify right now was the ‘Striking Thunderbolt.’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should give it a try.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan headed to the training room.
 </p>
 <p>
  It hadn’t even been 10 minutes since he had returned home.
 </p>
 <p>
  ***
 </p>
 <p>
  Chinese BattleNet Center’s operations room.
 </p>
 <p>
  “A significant variable has emerged in the upcoming league match against Korea.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Everyone was looking at the screen with serious faces.
 </p>
 <p>
  The variable in question was Seong Jihan, the weakest member of the Korean national team.
 </p>
 <p>
  [TL/N: They’re calling him Weakest because he’s in Gold.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The screen displayed footage of him annihilating the Russian national team.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even though he’s a Gold rank, he defeated Vladimir in Berserker Mode. There isn’t a warrior in our country who can go one-on-one with Vladimir in that state.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t Shinsong Il-ryong capable?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Shinsong Il-ryong, currently China’s top warrior, was a master martial artist who used the martial arts of the Shaolin Temple through his SS-grade gift, ‘Master of Shaolin.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He ranked fourth in the global warrior rankings, two places higher than Vladimir. However, competing with a berserk Vladimir in his frenzied state was still challenging.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Indeed. Shin Seung Il-ryong falls behind Vladimir in Berserker Mode as well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Facing a berserk Vladimir in equal combat was indeed difficult.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why do we have so few outstanding warriors in this small country!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Furthermore, I don’t want to trust it… but his skills apparently have an ‘Instant death’ effect.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Haha! That’s a real headache.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, to prepare for the Sword King… we planned to activate the contingency formation, ‘108 Arhats.'”
 </p>
 <p>
  When they mentioned ‘108 Arhats.’
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait , what?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re going to use ‘108 Arhats’ formation… on a mere Gold player?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The strategy room buzzed with commotion.

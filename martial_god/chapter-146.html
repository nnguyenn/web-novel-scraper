  Chapter 146
 </p>
 <p>
  The day before, the true nature of the “method” that Lim Gayeong had mentioned in the Daegi Guild was to trigger a dating scandal.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s make a scandal between Miss and Seong Jihan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey! What are you talking about?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan, why do you think they sent Miss to the Daegi Guild from her family?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They wanted to seduce you with Miss and recruit you to the Lee family. But now, your status has risen too much, and…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lim Gayeong’s expression hardened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Miss, who became the Guild Master, is doing too well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t it a good thing when family members do well?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The mistress doesn’t like it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan had an idea about the Lee family’s mistress’s story.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Lee Hayeon is an illegitimate kid.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, Chairman Lee, who is receiving treatment for severe dementia and not active in public, was known to have a reputation for liking women (too much) when he was healthy. He had a child outside of his marriage, Lee Hayeon, who was brought into the main family because she was special.
 </p>
 <p>
  The mistress of the family was said to have welcomed Lee Hayeon, who was an illegitimate child, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The actual situation must have been different.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering that she only matched strange guys with Hayeon, it didn’t look like she loved Lee Hayeon as portrayed on the outside.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Gayeong, is it okay for you to say that? If you go against Mom…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I became independent thanks to the young lady. It’s fine.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh? Because of me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You made money, didn’t you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That… yes?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Haah. How much did you earn, for heaven’s sake?” Hayeon asked with a little annoyance.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thanks to Miss, I could invest with confidence in different things!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Freed from her dependence on the Divergent Guild, Lim Gayeong now had the opportunity to speak.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If dating rumors with Seong Jihan emerge, even if it’s the Lee family, they won’t be able to force you to get married to another guy. Then Miss can continue as the Guild Master. And…”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Lim Gayeong added a few more words in an attempt to persuade Seong Jihan, he responded as if there was no need to listen further.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s fine. Let’s spread the dating rumors.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “And… Uh, yes?”
 </p>
 <p>
  With the presence of Lee Hayeon, who possessed S-rank gift, it was as simple as that.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s spread it today. What’s the most effective way?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, then…”
 </p>
 <p>
  ***
 </p>
 <p>
  Late at night, Han River Park.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Gayeong unnie, turn the lights up a bit! Alright, this should do it…! Now, both of you, please sit together! Get cozy!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, who had taken on the role of a photojournalist to stir up a dating rumor for the day, gave various instructions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s fine if you take pictures casually.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, come on, Uncle! It’s your first dating rumor photo; it has to come out well! It’s good if Hayeon unnie looks pretty, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the four gathered here, Yoon Seah was the most excited. She gestured with her hands, giving instructions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You look too distant; get closer!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swiftly, as Seong Jihan approached, Hayeon looked at him apologetically.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I… I’m really sorry. But are you okay with the dating rumor?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s okay. I’m not a celebrity. If you feel sorry, please continue as the Guild Master for a long time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll devote myself to the Guild!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s the right attitude.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, who was watching their conversation, gave them some guidance.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Get a bit more intimate! You still look like strangers.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do we need some physical contact? Are we in the Joseon era or something?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle, let’s put our arms around unnie’s shoulders a bit. It’s a dating rumor photo; we need something more concrete!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Click! Click!
 </p>
 <p>
  While taking pictures from different angles, Yoon Seah seemed somewhat dissatisfied.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… the pictures came out nicely, but I feel slightly disappointed. It would be better with more physical contact. Should we try a staged kiss?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why would we do a staged kiss for a dating rumor? This should be enough!” Hayeon was blushing very hard.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Unnie, we should make it clear! Let’s mimic it. Or you can just kiss for real?”
 </p>
 <p>
  On the way here, Yoon Seah had learned about Hayeon’s weakness and now pressured her.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh…”
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  “Let’s do it just once and then we’re done. We just need to kiss, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan casually asked and leaned forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Hayeon blushed and quickly moved away from him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What, how can you do that!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Miss has never done such an act in her entire life. The threshold is too high.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon hearing the lighting director Lim Gayeong’s words, Hayeon glanced at her from behind.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s because of you! You’ve been monitoring who I’m dating all the time!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now you can date freely. Thanks to Miss, I’m independent now. We’ll strictly protect your privacy~” Gayeong said with a glint in her eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sis, I made a mistake. Just hold hands, okay? I can take pictures of you both holding hands, right? It’s cute and nice!”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Yoon Seah suddenly spoke in a sweet tone, Hayeon, grinding her teeth, shouted, “Oh, just do it, the kiss!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Unnie, it’s okay, you don’t have to force yourself,” Seah said with a small smirk.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m fine too! Just do it now!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Saying so, Hayeon approached Seong Jihan and extended her lips.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, come on, not like a duck…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even when she extended her lips, it was almost comically exaggerated.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Put your lips together, relax.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swiftly, Seong Jihan wrapped his arms around Hayeon’s shoulders and swept her hair back.
 </p>
 <p>
  While holding the camera, he leaned in with their faces still close.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What… why is he so skilled at this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  While Hayeon was taken aback, their lips were getting incredibly close.
 </p>
 <p>
  Click! Click!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay, that’s enough!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah quickly finished the shoot, and Seong Jihan returned to his spot.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Take a look at this. The photos turned out well, didn’t they?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, they’re fine.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Hayeon still had a blushing face as she looked at the photo.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a picture that unmistakably showed Seong Jihan and Hayeon, their lips just about to touch.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh…”

 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan in the photo was leaning in casually, Hayeon, with her eyes tightly closed and feeling embarrassed, blushed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You seem more nervous than me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll send this to DAPatch. Hehe.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “R-really? You’re going to send this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, this should be a real attention-grabber, right? But sis… Are you really okay with this? If this leaks, it might mean the end of your popularity and your marriage prospects.” Seah asked Hayeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hayeon hesitated briefly at Yoon Seah’s question but thought, ‘…It’s better than being with those people.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Once she steps into the limelight, even if she doesn’t like them, her family will push her into a hasty marriage.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather than living like that, it’s a hundred times better to create a dating scandal.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is Boss really okay with this?” Hayeon asked Seong Jihan with a genuine expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m fine with it. It’s just a dating scandal. Stay in the business for a long time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay, let’s send it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sure, I’ll send it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah sent the photo to an investigative journalism outlet, claiming it was a special scoop.
 </p>
 <p>
  The next day, as expected, all hell broke loose.
 </p>
 <p>
  ***
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehe… So, you leaked it yourself.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. We can’t let the rumors persist.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I worried for nothing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Director Noh Youngjun breathed a sigh of relief internally as Seong Jihan seemed perfectly composed. Seong Jihan had become the key player of the Korean team, and if he wavered, their already challenging match against China would become even more improbable.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Director, I have a question.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ask me anything.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If player Akari were to naturalize, could she represent the national team?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… It’s possible, but isn’t she an assassin?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, that’s correct.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Assassins belong to the Archer class, so there might not be a place for her. Our archers are already oversaturated. In principle, you should have a level over 225.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In Korea, the most competitive position was the Archer. With a level of 211, Akari didn’t meet the basic criteria.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There are countless tactical possibilities with an assassin, but first, we need to level her up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With this thought in mind, Seong Jihan left the director’s office. This time, Ha Yeonjoo, the leader of the Archer team, approached him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan, are you okay? I saw the news this morning…”
 </p>

 <p>
  “I’m fine. I leaked it myself.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, I see. So, you two are really dating?”
 </p>
 <p>
  At first, she seemed concerned, but when Seong Jihan mentioned that he had leaked it himself, she quickly asked with curiosity.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, that’s right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I see… Yoori has been saying since this morning that her fan feelings are still strong, repeating, ‘My fandom is unshaken.'”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I got some messages too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What did they say?”Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan manipulated his phone and showed her a text message.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Jihan! Please let me join the guild too! I’m ready to team up anytime and defeat anyone with you! I think people need to be in the same space for bonds to form, hehe…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh! This girl really should stop messing with someone who has a girlfriend now. Please tell her it’s absolutely not allowed. Please.” Ha Yeonjoo begged Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh, Sure…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sigh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  While Ha Yeonjoo heaved a sigh of relief, the players from Warrior’s Team approached again. They were the main players who returned to the first team due to the coach’s decision.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, we’re really sorry. Last time, we didn’t even know you had a girlfriend and invited people.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right. Jihan, we truly apologize.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Kim Dongwoo and Lee Yoongi approached, Ha Yeonjoo glanced at them briefly and then spoke to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll go in first. They are people I don’t want to see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay, go ahead.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks to Coach Noh Youngjun’s persuasive efforts, Ha Yeonjoo wasn’t as opposed to their return to the first team as before, but she still felt uncomfortable seeing them, whether it was last time or now.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh, she’s always like this…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We did it with good intentions. It’s unfair. Really.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s the matter?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan stared expressionlessly, making Kim Dongwoo nervous despite having spoken informally just a while ago. The atmosphere made it strangely uncomfortable to speak casually.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Haha… Now that we’ve returned, we need to get along again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Get along…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the returning first-team Warriors. The ones who had caused trouble by having a party before the game. While he understood Coach Noh Youngjun’s decision to bring them back to the first team, he didn’t particularly want to socialize with them.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You watched the Russia match, right? For the China match, we should focus on my play, just like last time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, right. So, we’ll use the Triangle Formation…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, and then, you figure it out yourselves,” Jihan said strictly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, okay.” Lee Yoongi and Kim Dongwoo nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan stepped away, and Lee Yoongi let out a deep sigh.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh, he’s way more prickly than last time. I can’t even call him ‘hyung’ now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come on, that’s enough. Just being back in the team is a big deal.” Dongwoo said with a little optimism.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We should give him some space for a while.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah… Let’s not call girls for now. If we want to have fun, we can go out.” Yoongi said to Dongwoo.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right, right. Jin-hyung, we should use the Triangle Formation, shouldn’t we?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Dong-woo nodded as if things were finally going well.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. We probably won’t win the China match anyway. If we use the Triangle Formation, he’ll be responsible for turning things around, won’t he? It might even be better.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The leader of the Warriors was already filled with a sense of defeat. In fact, he wasn’t the only one with that mindset. When the national team players gathered in the strategy room after their training and analyzed the enemy’s power videos, sighs echoed from all sides.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh… China…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a top-tier team, really.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How can we beat that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  China, the second-best team in the world, possessed formidable power.
 </p>
 <p>
  “China is a flawless team. Especially, the strength of their mages and supporters is top-notch worldwide. If there’s one weakness, it might be the Warriors who are relatively weaker compared to their class.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking at the despondent players, Coach Noh Youngjun managed his expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  In fact, the coach was well aware that they had a shortage of power. But he believed that if he succumbed to despair, it would be the end. Instead, he focused on hopeful elements.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Luckily, the first two games are on the same South Gate map as the previous Russia match. In the first game, we’ll be on the attack.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But in long-range matches, won’t we fall behind?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why play a long-range match when we have Seong Jihan? We’ll use his Instant Death skill aggressively if we have to, but we must secure the first game.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s marksmanship was unparalleled in maps with specific points to defend, like South Gate. Noh Youngjun, the coach, believed in that for the first game, or rather, he had no other option.
 </p>
 <p>
  “And in the next game…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Coach Noh Youngjun briefed the players on the strategies from the second to the fifth game. The expressions of the players changed subtly as they listened to the coach’s explanations.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This… Is this a strategy focused on Seong Jihan?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is a strategy similar to when we had the Sword King.”
 </p>
 <p>
  For the China match, Seong Jihan was the linchpin in every game. Based on his outstanding performance in the Russia match, the tactics of the Korean national team gradually shifted to revolve around Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If he crumbles, it’s over.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Excluding Seong Jihan, the Korean team’s strategies for the China match were virtually non-existent.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If it’s not Seong Jihan, there’s no chance of winning.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This might be the better way…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s focus on support like we did during the Sword King era.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, the Korean national team prepared their tactics with Seong Jihan at the center.
 </p>
 <p>
  And time passed quickly. The day of the China match had arrived.

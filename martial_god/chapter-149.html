  <strong>
   Chapter 149
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  [The map for the 5th game is the ‘Invasion: Capture the Flag.’]
 </p>
 <p>
  [75 players will be participating.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a team match!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Cheers erupted from the Chinese national team.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well… it’s a Capture the Flag map.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I guess it’s tough to have two individual matches in a row…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Conversely, the atmosphere among the Korean national team was subdued. They expected the 5th game to be challenging, especially after suffering consecutive defeats in the team matches, except for the first one.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The map size… with 75 players, it’s considered a small map, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, that’s correct.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This doesn’t look good.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Coach Noh Youngjun let out a sigh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Capture the Flag, as the name suggests, is a game where players compete to capture more randomly generated flags at key points on the map. The game’s outcome is typically decided 30 minutes later based on the number of flags stored in each team’s main base. However, this map had several different victory conditions, such as eliminating all players from the opposing team or destroying the enemy’s main base.
 </p>
 <p>
  The reason for Noh Youngjun’s dark expression was precisely these victory conditions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…In small maps, China has a 100% win rate.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, of all things, it had to be a small map! If it were a 100-player map, we would have had a chance!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Although it was called a small map, the size of the Capture the Flag map was substantial. However, the problem was that Je Galheon, China’s Grand Mage, had a spell range that matched it, even from his main base, sometimes to the point of using super spells.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes… in small maps, even if Je Galheon draws a bad card, the meteor strike spell will reach the target due to the Joo-Ryung’s buff.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How long did the games take for China?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “On average, they took about 20 to 30 minutes. If Je Galheon drew a good card, it could end in 15 minutes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehe… this is just unbelievable!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Contrary to the original game mode of Capture the Flag, when China played the map, they unilaterally bombarded the enemy’s main base, and the game ended. No matter how many flags the opposing team secured, they couldn’t win because the place where flags should be stored was blown up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even if they try to disrupt our ability to use magic…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s because of that damn Golden Dragon. Only Seong Jihan can deal a proper blow.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not easy because of 108 Arhat Formation”
 </p>
 <p>
  Noh Youngjun let out a sigh. China, already a strong team, became even more formidable with 108 Arhat Formation. Of course, the formation itself had many weaknesses, so the side that received the blow could gain an overwhelming numerical advantage.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even if it’s 74 to 57, can we win… it’s quite daunting.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With only one player missing from the team, Noh Youngjun couldn’t see a winning scenario. This was because the synergy between China’s mages and support players was overwhelming. The mood among the coaching staff seemed to have infected the national team players, as they all had dark expressions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Except for one person. Excluding Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Coach, I think we can defeat 108 Arhat Formation this time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In the first, second, and third games, 108 Arhat Formation had been a formidable opponent. In the second and third games, they were even more powerful due to the suppression by the enhanced Jin. But Seong Jihan now had confidence. He had the conviction that he could defeat it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really? You think so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, so please bear with it for just 20 minutes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “20 minutes…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Surely, they could endure for about 20 minutes. Noh Youngjun nodded with a glimmer of hope in his heart.
 </p>
 <p>
  ***
 </p>
 <p>
  Capture the Flag map, China’s main base.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan walked there alone. Even without forming a triangle formation, he approached alone.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That Korean is so arrogant.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why not just kill him instead of using 108 Arhat Formation?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where’s that confidence coming from?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Chinese players seemed to take it as an insult and complained, but those who had been defeated by Seong Jihan in the fourth game urged Il-ryong to cast his spell.
 </p>
 <p>
  Il-ryong started the process to cast 108 Arhat Formation again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shinsong Il-ryong, the most influential warrior on the Chinese national team had a dark expression due to the ties score.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s time for 108 Arhat Formation to test Seong Jihan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how far Seong Jihan was, as long as he was within the field of vision of Shinsong Il-ryong, 108 Arhat Formation’s suppression effect was applied.
 </p>

 <p>
  Once inside the vortex created by Shinsong Il-ryong.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Magic cannot overcome destiny. The Shaolin always stood at the forefront under the banner of Heaven”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  Shinsong Il-ryong struck the ground with his staff. A system message appeared in front of Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  [108 Arhat Formation forms a formation specialized for martial arts.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The power of Martial Arts magic from the orthodox faction is restricted.]
 </p>
 <p>
  After the formation was disrupted by the Eclipse in the first game, Shinsong Il-ryong continued to use martial arts formations.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a result, the shadow energy of Seong Jihan’s Sword Eclipse drained away and he stored it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh, still annoying!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anyway, let’s go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With just the Pheonix Spear in hand, Seong Ji-han waited. The warriors holding clubs all charged toward him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just like the first match, there were no standout players; everyone looked like regular warriors from Shaolin.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Ji-han swung his spear horizontally.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nameless Divine Art, Triad of Martial Mastery – Total Annihilation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Kie]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Lucky]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s spear divided the ranks of the Shaolin warriors.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, not everyone fell before Seong Jihan’s strikes. About half of them raised their staff to block Seong Jihan’s attack. Normally, he would have cut through all of them easily.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘His power is only about 20% of its usual strength.’
 </p>
 <p>
  108 Arhat Formation’s suppression, even with only half its strength, was quite formidable. Even half of the strong martial artists were suppressed. In this state, even the use of other martial arts that are not part of the Martial God system was difficult.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition, the fallen martial artists were quickly replaced by new ones, and the living ones swung their staff forcefully.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s spear moved gracefully, blocking all attacks and overwhelming the surroundings. However, the martial artists’ tactics seemed endless.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh, Seong Jihan… the martial artists who have shaved their heads are constantly pressuring him!
 </p>
 <p>
  -No matter how many Shaolin martial artists he defeats, they keep coming. Isn’t this worse than zombies?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Hehe, they called it 108 Arhat Formation.. but how many of them are popping out?
 </p>
 <p>
  The commentators were exhausted by the relentless martial artists. If someone other than Seong Jihan were inside, they would have been overwhelmed by the staff.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, Seong Jihan, even with his strength suppressed, was parrying all the martial artists’ attacks and counter attacking.
 </p>
 <p>
  A smile appeared on Seong Jihan’s lips.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This kind of battle has its own taste. With power restrained, there are even some advantages.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Since gaining the ability of the star and the void after obtaining the Martial Soul, Seong Jihan couldn’t fully control his power. He felt like he was using his newfound strength rather than pushing the limits of his ability. But now, with his power restricted, he could truly appreciate how limitless the potential of the star’s ability was.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘My strength… I can pull out more here.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Whosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Total Annihilation was unleashed again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The monks were all split in two.
 </p>
 <p>
  The horizontal cut was much more powerful than a while ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  All the martial artists’ staff had strong energy, but this time, they couldn’t stop Seong Jihan’s strike.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This guy… he’s incredibly persistent!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Monks wore an exasperated expression. It seemed like Seong Jihan was getting stronger as time passed.
 </p>
 <p>
  He couldn’t unleash a powerful technique like in the first round, but his mastery of using the spear was exceptional, evoking both jealousy and awe in Shinsong Il-ryung. Seong Jihan wasn’t just a player who had been chosen to increase his stats. His martial skills were already complete, as if he were a finished martial artist.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Would you just die already…! Palm of the Golden Buddha!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Il-ryung’s hand gleamed with a golden light.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a completely different level from the first round, a golden ki that shone brilliantly flew toward Seong Jihan. Ignoring the surrounding martial artists, it drew a large golden hand shape as it fiercely rushed toward Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  The level of skill contained within was far from being considered sophisticated, but with the assistance of 108 Arhat Formation, the power was quite restrained.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can’t block it with my basic skills.’
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s why, during the second and third rounds, Seong Jihan avoided the attacks and looked for openings. At that time, he thought there would be plenty of time.
 </p>
 <p>
  But after losing the second and third rounds, he realized.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There’s no room for error on the national team.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The national team was as fragile as a sandcastle, and there was no room to drag out the time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recalled a skill to deal with this situation. While the three divine techniques were unavailable due to power constraints, there was one skill he could use.

 <p>
  “My own martial art, a fusion of Striking Thunderbolt and Phoenix’s Flames. This martial art was modified from the Divine Thunder Decree, and had a low success rate.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m
 </p>
 <p>
  Thunderbolt’s thunderous power was significantly stronger than the mere flickering flames of Phoenix.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Restricting one’s power might actually allow for a proper fusion,’ Seong Jihan thought about the arhat formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  The excessive power it had was suppressed within 108 Arhat Formation. It was clear that the path to unveiling the initial enlightenment had become apparent.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nameless divine art, Fusion of Divine thunder and phoenix: Crimson Thunder cannon
 </p>
 <p>
  At the tip of the spear, a flash of red lightning occurred, and a single stream of electricity extended. The energy emitted by this red lightning seemed much smaller and weaker compared to the Divine Thunder Decree martial arts Seong Jihan was using…
 </p>
 <p>
  While the intensity of the crimson lightning may have appeared weak and feeble compared to the Celestial Thunder Divine Technique Seong Jihan had been using until now, it had an entirely different nature.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What…?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack!
 </p>
 <p>
  In an instant, the surroundings were torn apart like a scroll.
 </p>
 <p>
  The gathered energy remained a fiery red, and a single strand of Red Thunder did not stop its movement.
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzzt!
 </p>
 <p>
  Without any chance to react, Shinsong Il-ryung was pierced by the red lightning, creating a gaping hole in his chest. Flames erupted through the crack.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the blink of an eye, it seemed like his body would be consumed by the flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  “B-But we’re inside 108 Arhat formation…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside 108 Arhat Formation, Shinsong Il-ryung, was immortal. Even if the crimson lightning possessed extraordinary destructive power, his body would regenerate quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  That was how it should be…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why… Why is this happening…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Strangely, the crack was expanding, and the flames that erupted from his chest showed no signs of extinguishing.
 </p>
 <p>
  The regenerative abilities of the Chinese warrior struggled to contain these flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shinsong Il-ryong couldn’t stand against the overwhelming feeling of his strength dissipating.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  He fell to his knees, and not long after that, the Red Thunder that had pierced his chest extended even further.
 </p>
 <p>
  Towards the temple with the inscription “Shaolin.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Before reaching the temple, a thick protective barrier blocked the Red Thunder’s path. However, the crimson lightning tore through it, piercing the building.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rumbling flames erupted from all directions, consuming the structure.
 </p>
 <p>
  The plaque bearing the characters ‘Shaolin Temple’ turned to dust instantly, vanishing.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Shaolin monk avatars surrounding Seong Jihan halted their movements and gradually became transparent.
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, a system message appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The core of 108 Arhat Formation has collapsed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [108 Arhat Formation is disbanding.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Huh, Shaolin temple was really the core…’ Seong Jihan thought with a smirk on his face.
 </p>
 <p>
  Originally, he had only intended to rip through monk avatars with the Red Thunderball and inflict some damage on Shinsong Il-ryong.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The power of Crimson Thunder Cannon… It’s far superior to my expectations.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Krrrr…
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan gazed at the crumbling temple and smiled slightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  108 Arhat Formation
 </p>
 <p>
  Throughout this match, he had been biding his time, and thanks to that, he had found an opportunity to enhance his martial arts further.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps that was why.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve slightly modified the martial arts to better suit me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “My Martial Soul increased by 5.”
 </p>
 <p>
  For the first time, his Martial Soul increased by five points in one go, despite allocating stat points in the past without any increase.
 </p>
 <p>
  Furthermore,
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Thundercloud Spear’ which was integrated into the Phoenix Spear has fully acknowledged you as the player.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’ve acquired the skill ‘Summon Lightning Cloud.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The thundercloud spear, previously combined with the Phoenix Spear, seemed to have recognized him as its rightful owner after experiencing the power of the Red Thunderball.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Now, I just need to win this match.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He had said 20 minutes, but it felt like it had ended in about 15 minutes. Returning to the game map, he could sweep through the enemy base and secure the victory.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s what Seong Jihan thought as he left 108 Arhat Formation
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your base has been destroyed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’ve lost the game.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A system message announcing his defeat in the game instead of one from the enemy’s base appeared in front of him.

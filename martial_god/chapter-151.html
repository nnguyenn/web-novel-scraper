  <strong>
   Chapter 151
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow, Uncle! Earlier in the car, I couldn’t speak, so I was getting really antsy… But they said they’re giving you a 10 percent share in the guild!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Arriving at the penthouse, Yoon Seah excitedly showed the messages exchanged with Sofia to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They’re giving 10 percent?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was equally surprised by the generous deal. He had suspected that Robert Gates, besides appointing him as the guild master, might come up with an appealing proposal, but he never expected a 10 percent share.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. Isn’t this… heckin’ amazing? If it’s American First, it’s the world’s top guild. Considering the value of this share… Wow, this is incredible.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah looked up the current value of American First on the internet and was thrilled.
 </p>
 <p>
  How many zeros are there at the end?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Still, I won’t go to the United States.”
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Seong Jihan was momentarily surprised by the fact that they were offering a share but still had no intention of going to the United States.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle, even though it’s 10 percent?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. I have to feed the World tree’s Leaf to the Sword King. If I go to the United States, the chances of matching with Japan will be almost gone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The regional leagues were different for the United States and Japan. For the two countries to face each other, they had to meet in the World Champions League.
 </p>
 <p>
  In that case, it made more sense for Seong Jihan, who was part of Korea in the same regional league.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh… Am I crazy? Uncle, thinking about dad like that while I’m here getting lost in the share…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “10 percent is quite a lot.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you… Uncle. To give that up for Dad…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah seemed deeply moved, but Seong Jihan just smiled bitterly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, it was originally because of the nationality bonus.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Initially, he had intended to stay here due to the nationality bonus that could only be obtained in Korea.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, after obtaining the martial soul, he no longer needed to rely heavily on the nationality bonus. He was confident that he could reach the top of the player world rankings without the nationality bonus, as long as he properly developed his martial skills and raised the martial soul stat.
 </p>
 <p>
  But there was a catch.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘After all, I’ll just be a foreigner there.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Through his experience of exile, Seong Jihan had personally felt how difficult it was to fully assimilate into American society as a foreigner.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I already have a solid foundation in Korea; there’s really no need to go abroad. The only issue might be at the national team level, but… if Seah continues to grow and reaches Sword King’s level, the situation will improve. But, That’s only when we solve Ito Shizuru’s scandals.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Regarding the national team level, there won’t be any more concerns. So, his decision was not to go to the United States.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah, would you really feel okay just passing up on this offer?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why? Do you have a good reason?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Before, when you looked at this house, Did it stress you out… Does it still bother you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  In response to Seong Jihan’s question, Yoon Seah looked around the house and slowly shook her head. While in the past, the traces of her dad’s abandonment had made her feel suffocated and melancholic just by staying in the house, it was no longer the case.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, it doesn’t. I mean, now I know why my dad did that…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “In that case, you can regain the building.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Regain it? Don’t you mean the building you donated back then?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, exactly. The situation is different from back then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Back when the Sword King abandoned his family to go to Japan, Yoon Seah faced baseless criticism and condemnation. But now, with Seong Jihan emerging as the only hope for the Korean national team, the situation had completely turned around in just a few months.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was time to reclaim the Sword Palace.
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  -They’re trying to recruit Seong Jihan in the United States again?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yes, they’ve offered him the position of guild master.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Huh. Guild master of American First… that’s something.
 </p>
 <p>
  Oh Gyuseung, the Director of the BattleNet Administration, furrowed his brow. After Seong Jihan was selected for the national team, his performance was remarkable. Still, offering him the position of guild master seemed a bit excessive.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Currently, isn’t Oliver the guild master of American First and the world’s top-ranked player? Would he willingly give up that position?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “American First is a guild heavily influenced by the Gates family and the U.S. government. Even if he expresses his refusal, the guild master can be replaced at any time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, I see… But didn’t Seong Jihan refuse to go to the U.S. even when he was in Silver? He turned down their offer.”
 </p>

 </p>
 <p>
  When the United States got involved in a bidding war, which country could win? However, since Seong Jihan didn’t go to the U.S. even when he was in Silver, Oh Gyuseung had some expectations.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, should we just wait and see?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well… yes. That’s what the manager in charge of Seong Jihan suggested.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You mean Manager Park Yoonsik?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, exactly. I told him to find out Seong Jihan’s intentions.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But Manager Park is on vacation…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What could be more important than this right now? Tell him to come back right away. We’ll give him time off later!”
 </p>
 <p>
  And so, Park Yoonsik, who had left for a vacation to the Eastern Sea, had to return to Seoul on the same day and visit Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the response he received…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan said he hasn’t looked into the matter in detail yet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, Sophia hasn’t even arrived yet, right? Maybe we were too hasty.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. But… he suddenly asked me when he should leave Sword Palace.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why would he bring up Sword Palace at this point?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. He seemed curious about when the confirmed date would be.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Why would he suddenly mention Sword Palace?
 </p>
 <p>
  “And… he also asked if the donation process was finished or not…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Oh Gyuseung, the head of administration, began to have a rough idea.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, what do you think? Do you believe he wants to regain the Sword Palace?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Personally, I think that’s the case.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really? If it were up to me, I’d want to return it right away… But it’s not under our jurisdiction.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sword Palace was too large a building for the administration to return it unilaterally. This was an issue that had to be handled at the government level, not by the administration.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But… what if, hypothetically, the government’s handling is delayed, and Seong Jihan ends up going to the U.S.? Would I even keep this position?”
 </p>
 <p>
  In response to Oh Gyuseung’s question, Park Yoon-sik remained silent. Not saying no essentially meant saying yes. If Seong Jihan were to emigrate to the United States based on their proposal, the administration would resign and a national uproar was almost certain.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Honestly, players like Seong Jihan, even if you gave them a dozen Sword Palaces, couldn’t be bought. And his current rank is Gold, Gold! When he becomes Diamond later… he’ll probably surpass the world’s best.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I agree with that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Should we let a player like that go to the U.S.?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s spread some rumors to get public opinion moving.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you mean to spread rumors from our administration?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Make it seem like information leaked due to an employee’s negligence.”
 </p>
 <p>
  How did he even get into the position as the Director? Shouldn’t he have to maintain the position for a long time? And furthermore, “This is something absolutely necessary for South Korea,” as the country needed Seong Jihan to stay in Korea.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If it’s known that Seong Jihan received an incredible offer in the United States, and is trying to reclaim Sword Palace… but the U.S. has made an offer that doesn’t even compare…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… I understand.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The director, having understood Seong Jihan’s intentions, decided to spread the rumors at the administrative level.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan is the talk of the town these days. The rumors will spread quickly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  But the Director was uncertain about how the aftermath of these rumors would play out.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What… What’s this? An article is already out?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Not even 30 minutes had passed since the directive was given, but looking at the front page of the portal site news plastered with headlines all about Seong Jihan, he couldn’t help but be shocked.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Seong Jihan. Transferring to American First!? Offered the Position of Guild Master!]
 </p>
 <p>
  As news articles began to break out with headlines like:
 </p>
 <p>
  [World Ranking 1st Place Oliver States, ‘I’ll Gladly Step Down if Seong Jihan Takes the Guild Master Position.’]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Robert Gates Remarks, ‘The Guild Master Position is Just the First Button of This Giant Offer.’]
 </p>
 <p>
  With comments from American officials added to the mix, chaos erupted instantly:𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  -WTF? AF Guild Master?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ah, so Gates was fond of him because he hasn’t been sponsoring anyone lately, and now suddenly…
 </p>
 <p>
  -WTF, WTF, WTF, WTF!
 </p>
 <p>
  -He was doing so well in the China match… he was too good, it made me nervous!
 </p>
 <p>
  -The American response is crazy. They’re welcoming him even though he’s replacing Oliver as the Guild Master. ‘Please come’, haha!

 <p>
  -He’s only Gold, and he’s wiping the floor with Diamond players. Moreover, he’s becoming the core position, which is insane!
 </p>
 <p>
  Right now, AF fans are challenging each other with ‘SUNG’ markings on their uniforms, haha!
 </p>
 <p>
  The world’s only Esports BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  The game was already highly popular, and the match between Korea and China yesterday was not only watched in both countries but also became a worldwide sensation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Particularly, Seong Jihan’s participation as a mage in the fourth game garnered the most attention, and all experts were praising his strategic potential:
 </p>
 <p>
  -No, seriously, it’s impossible. We watched the China match. If Seong Jihan goes, it’s our end!
 </p>
 <p>
  -The Americans, despite being the number one ranked country in the world, are pulling off a miracle. But the miracle is really huge…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yeah, seriously, the miracle is bigger than a flea’s liver!
 </p>
 <p>
  -For real, the miracle’s liver is bigger than a flea’s, haha!
 </p>
 <p>
  As news of Seong Jihan’s transfer was flooding the portal sites:
 </p>
 <p>
  [The United States Proposing a Guild Master, South Korea Trying to Reclaim Sword Palace.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Daegi Guild Temporarily Suspending Player Acquisition. Will the Guild leave for the United States?]
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment, a guest was being received in the waiting guild. It was Sophia, the one who had sent the message that had turned Korea upside down.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hayeon, look into my eyes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia rushed to find Hayeon as soon as she arrived, her expression starkly different from her usual cheerful demeanor.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you really dating Jihan?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Blink! Blink!
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia’s eyes sparkled with gold.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hayeon, looking at her serious expression, responded as if in disbelief, “No… What’s with those eyes? Are you using a skill or something?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehe. They’re eyes that reveal only the truth. So! What’s your answer?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well… Of course, we are!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Hayeon tried to speak as naturally as possible while looking at her, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  “As expected, you’re not dating.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia’s expression brightened. The golden glow vanished from her eyes, and they returned to their original blue color.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why did you even equip the ‘Eyes of Truth’?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jihan!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud! Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan and Yoon Seah entered the guild master’s office, Sophia approached Jihan with a cheerful smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I knew you weren’t dating! I can’t imagine you with anyone else but me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I-Is that why you equipped the eyes of truth?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, anything certain is good, you know?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s the ‘Eyes of Truth’?”
 </p>
 <p>
  In response to Yoon Seah’s question, Sophia took out a lens from her eye and showed it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s an item that allows you to determine the truth and falsehood in what others say. It’s a one-time use only.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That sounds pretty expensive, doesn’t it…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “About 5 million GP?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah looked at Sophia in disbelief. She had spent 500 million to get a lie detector.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jihan, I saw the news when I came to Korea. There was quite a rumor, wasn’t there?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You mean the AF transfer rumors?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Would you consider joining our guild as the guild master? We’ll even share 10 percent of AF’s ownership with you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, I won’t be going.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even if we offer more ownership?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Too bad…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon hearing Seong Jihan’s firm response, Sophia gave up on further persuasion.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You gave up quickly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I had a feeling he wouldn’t come. If he were really coming, he wouldn’t have spread rumors like this. He’d have negotiated quietly behind the scenes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She had some insight into Seong Jihan’s personality and could deduce the outcome of this situation by the loudness of the rumors.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is there anything I can do to help?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon hearing Sophia’s offer, Seong Jihan smiled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you’re offering to help, should I consider expanding my business?”
 </p>

  Chapter 157
 </h3>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chapter 157
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Mother?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was puzzled, but he didn’t show it on his face and observed the situation with a calm expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Tsk… Can’t you see with your eyes? How is our boss your mother!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Note: Changing the way Karlein addresses Seong Jihan from ‘Head’ to ‘Boss’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite having his chest pierced, Karlein spoke as if nothing had happened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “He’s a male! So I’m trying to merge with him!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re quite the noisy one.”
 </p>
 <p>
  From the Eclipse, a green light flashed and strands of light spread out towards Karlein’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  The robe, which disappeared in an instant when touched by the green light.
 </p>
 <p>
  From within, the King’s spirits poured out, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ohh. This power!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Finally, rest is upon us!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Purified…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The spirits were swiftly annihilated by the green energy from the Eclipse.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Tch, that damn sword… How annoying!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  As Karlein’s robe exploded and the spirits poured out, the high elf nimbly moved her body back.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ve stuffed so many restless souls in there!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  With the robe completely gone, the spirits came together to form one being.
 </p>
 <p>
  The gathered ghosts formed the shape of a giant, and explosive dark magic energy burst forth, truly befitting an avatar of the Constellations.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Restless souls!? They’re all kings who voluntarily help me out!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the overwhelming presence, his playful voice remained the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Elf doll. I’ll rip you apart first and then merge with the Boss!”
 </p>
 <p>
  On the other hand, the high elf didn’t even bother to listen to Karlein’s words and knelt on one knee, bowing her head towards Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mother… I’m sorry! I’ve failed to subdue the enemy!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even in this urgent situation, the high elf was being overly courteous.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Why is she calling me mother?’
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hmm… it seems that high elf has mistaken you for the ‘Root of the World Tree’. Only the root of the World Tree is called Mother by elves.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Root?’
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s like the king who controls the elven organizations of each planet. They communicate directly with the World Tree and lead the World Tree Alliance in their respective planets.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So quite an important existence.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yet I don’t know why she’s mistaking you for the root…]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm… Could it be because of the essence I got from the Seed of Life?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan slowly released the energy he had kept sealed in a corner of his body.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ah! You’ve only kept the essence of life within you. A high elf would instinctively know this much, so with just this much, it’s enough for her to mistake you for the root. Wait, sorry… you’re not actually the root, right?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel also seemed conflicted by how pure the sealed energy was, doubting if Seong Jihan was actually himself and asking for confirmation.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘The World Tree is space trash and should be thrown into the sun.’ Say that.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “The World Tree is space trash and should be thrown into the sun.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hmm… you’re right, master. Sorry about that. It’s just that the aura is so similar to the root’s.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan replied without hesitation. Hearing this, Ariel’s wariness disappeared from her voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Let me give you a tip… If you’re going to pretend to be the root in front of the high elf, don’t speak awkwardly and just nod. Then they’ll interpret it on their own.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Got it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [Even if your attitude is a bit awkward, slowly releasing the essence of life will prevent any doubts.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “To destroy that thing, it seems I’ll have to root out the sword. Mother, please permit it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the high elf asked for permission to attack Karlein, Seong Jihan silently nodded as Ariel had coached.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he subtly released the essence of life into his right hand, the impassive high elf’s face brightened immediately.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh! To grant permission like this… I am truly grateful!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Stab!
 </p>
 <p>
  The high elf then broke her sword in half and stabbed one of the broken halves into the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sword fragment seemed to be absorbed into the earth, and then…
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle!
 </p>
 <p>
  Green vines burst out from the ground, and countless green flowers bloomed.
 </p>
 <p>
  While it appeared to be a beautifully blossoming flower garden,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Garden of the Sun, Bloom!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud! Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the high elf finished speaking, cracks appeared at the center of the flowers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then…
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  A powerful suction force emerged from between the flowers, pulling in Karlein’s ghostly giant form bit by bit.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Rest! Finally rest…!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Eat me too!
 </p>
 <p>
  The king’s spirits happily welcomed being absorbed by the flowers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Karlein’s physical body was helpless against the blossoming flowers sucking him in from all directions.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  The giant form rapidly decreased in size.
 </p>
 <p>
  In particular, the spirits making up Karlein’s left arm disappeared in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What? That easily?’
 </p>
 <p>
  From what he had seen of their fight so far, Seong Jihan was ready to jump in at any moment, but the avatar of the Constellation of the Dead Star was pathetically crumbling away.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Are those flowers that strong?’
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Garden of the Sun is the strongest power an elf can wield. It’s only because you have the essence of life that she’s not revealing her hostility.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s ending quite lamely.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hmm… However strong a Constellation avatar is, he’s being overwhelmed quite poorly. Among the Constellations, the Dead Star is known as one of the strongest existences.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  With Karlein’s limbs completely swallowed up by the flowers…
 </p>
 <p>
  Only his torso and head fell to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the connecting spirits were absorbed as well, his oversized torso and head fell to the ground and rolled around.
 </p>
 <p>
  “….Boss, it’s you. You…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  From Karlein’s head that rolled near Seong Jihan, a red light flashed within the darkness shrouding his face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You… got eaten by that hag too…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The light that moved around like an eyeball eventually fixed onto the essence of life in Seong Jihan’s right hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How could I have found the Boss’s head… You wouldn’t have used your own power like this if you were the boss!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The red light gradually turned black.
 </p>
 <p>
  Karlein’s voice, with only his head remaining, grew lower and lower.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…..If I can’t have it, I won’t let anyone else have it either.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Scritch! scratch!
 </p>
 <p>
  Light seeped out from the darkness shrouding Karlein’s face.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then…
 </p>
 <p>
  [Die.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Constellation commanded death.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Plop! Plop!
 </p>
 <p>
  The green flowers all lost their vitality and began to wilt.
 </p>
 <p>
  From the shattered darkness, the aura of death spread out in all directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  The crimson aura, exceeding the original dark magic energy, was now stretching towards Seong Jihan as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is no joke.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Until now, Karlein had shown only a frivolous side unbecoming of a Constellation, but the power he was exhibiting now proved why he was called the Constellation of the Dead Star.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Eek! M-Mother, run away…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The high elf couldn’t even finish speaking before collapsing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite her regeneration surpassing that of a cockroach, it seemed she couldn’t resist the power of death.
 </p>
 <p>
  The high elf, who had reached the TOP 25, died so easily.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, the power of death exceeds all expectations! Even the high elf died, so why not reveal your true identity?]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What would revealing it achieve? Should I have my head cut off?’
 </p>
 <p>
  [Isn’t having your head cut off better than dying?]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No, dying is a hundred times better.’ Seong Jihan distanced himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  The direction he aimed for was behind him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What… What is this? What’s going on?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I survived the Thunder God… No!”
 </p>
 <p>
  It was where the rest of the players who had been summoned recently were.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, if one more person dies, it’s over.’
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no need to engage with that dangerous power of death’s authority.
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the goals of this game was for five to survive.
 </p>
 <p>
  Would the other players endure facing that power that killed the high elf?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Those guys definitely can’t withstand that disgusting thing’s power, can they?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking this, Seong Jihan flew towards the players as if telling them to try getting hit by Karlein’s power too, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  [World Tree. Do you think such tricks will work?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m
 </p>
 <p>
  The crimson-black light, the power of death, passed right through the five players.
 </p>
 <p>
  They sighed in relief but couldn’t help feeling thrilled, indirectly experiencing the power.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What… What is this? Is this the power of death? How do we stop it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is he an Avatar of the Constellation of the Dead Star !”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……I heard the Dead Star is the next disaster in the universe after the Wandering Martial God. How can his avatar use such power? Filthy bastard probably wants it to become a Constellation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Feeling the difference in power through Karlein’s Death Command, the Constellation avatars reaffirmed the gap compared to themselves.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, since it was just the avatar using the power of death, they could have blocked it if the real Dead Star had come out, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  They couldn’t think of any way to stop it if the real Karlein used that power.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If that guy’s real body uses that, I’d die instantly.’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Things were better when he was just a star fragment making noise…’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So many freaks since coming to the Space League.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The avatars of the Constellations, who had warily decided not to even glance at the Dead Star’s side, now looked longingly at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘We need him to die quickly so the game ends with 5 of us!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the power of death had not yet reached him due to his unexpectedly fast speed, it was ultimately a matter of time.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hurry up and die!’
 </p>

 <p>
  As the five avatars of the constellations fervently wished for Seong Jihan’s death…
 </p>
 <p>
  “This won’t work.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan gave up the escape. After all, there was no chance of the other players dying even if he delayed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No point in fighting against that dangerous power of death either.’
 </p>
 <p>
  So the best choice was to stake his life here.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Are you going to reveal your identity?]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No, it won’t make a difference. Rather than living with that filthy head, it’s better to settle things here.’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s not fully developed yet…’
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the martial arts that allowed his Martial Soul to surge during the Promotion Match, thanks to the Warrior’s inspiration.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the time, it was questionable whether it could be called an adaptation, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  Now that the Warrior’s inspiration exploded once more, things were different.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Alright. Let’s try it out.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan smiled mockingly and switched out his spear and Eclipse.
 </p>
 <p>
  He held the Eclipse in the right hand containing the essence of life.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master? I’m incompatible with that aura. It’s the power of our nemesis, the World Tree…]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Just bear with it for a moment.’
 </p>
 <p>
  […I warned you in advance.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan ignored that warning and filled Eclipse with the essence of life. The dark sword emitted a green light, reducing its size. Nevertheless, both powers coexisted in the same space. In that state, Seong Jihan crossed the sword and spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan swung the sword and spear in an X-shape with the two forces combined.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nameless Divine Arts, Annihilation God’s Secret – Blood Cross.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish! swish! swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  The marble wall of the temple was instantly torn apart, forming a massive cross. In the center, a hole was pierced, creating a pure white cross. Originally carved into the ground, the Blood Cross was now created in mid-air, shielding Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  When the essence of life adhered to the white cross…
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  A green protective barrier enveloped Seong Ji-Han.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Isn’t this supposed to be an instant death skill?]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Trying to use it defensively for once.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [Just deciding that and making it work… is possible?]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It works for me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  […Wow.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  In an instant, the crimson light of death reached the cross. Karlein, however, believed that no matter how much Seong Jihan struggled, it would be futile. The power of death was not bound by any restraints, so blocking it was a pointless endeavor.
 </p>
 <p>
  However…
 </p>
 <p>
  [No…! Death….]
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  The power of death couldn’t penetrate through and bounced off.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Blood Cross was an instant death skill, extremely potent but not easily usable in mobile situations. Seong Jihan had tried to modify it in some way, and that’s how he succeeded in raising the cross into the air. But once it was floating in mid-air, he couldn’t pierce it with his spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike the ground, the cross was incredibly sturdy, making it difficult to break. Even though it still needed further research and development, in this situation, the unbreakable cross actually worked in his favor.
 </p>
 <p>
  The unbreakable nature of the Blood Cross provided strong resistance against the power of death.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom! Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the light of death kept bouncing off…
 </p>
 <p>
  [Wait. Wait a moment! This is… you… could it be!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Karlein’s voice, which had sunk low, gradually grew brighter.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the end, he even tried to go into his high-pitched tone.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite his command being blocked, he seemed happy about it.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You! You! It’s you, boss, right!? That hag wouldn’t have used her own power like that! It’s you, right!? Boss, boss!!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan didn’t bother responding to Karlein’s crazed shouting.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead, he threw the Phoenix flag above his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nameless Divine Arts, Heavenly Thunder Decree – Celestial Judgment
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash flash flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  An enormous spear of light struck down upon Karlein’s head.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike usual, the Celestial Judgment carrying Striking Thunderbolt completely pierced Karlein’s head, setting it ablaze.
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s the boss, I knew it, I believed in youuu!!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, damn it. So noisy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [More, insult me moreee!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Even as he disappeared, Karlein was jumping around happily.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then…
 </p>
 <p>
  [See you next time, boss! Teeheehee…….]
 </p>
 <p>
  Leaving those words as his will, Karlein disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  And with that…
 </p>
 <p>
  [There are only 5 players remaining.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Promotion Test has ended.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Promotion Match was over.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Phew.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Somehow, Seong Jihan has survived. As he let out a sigh of relief, a message appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment…
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Ruler of the Divine Throne, ‘Brahma’ has taken an interest in you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [He wishes to become your sponsoring Constellation. Will you accept?]
 </p>
 <p>
  An unexpected offer arrived.

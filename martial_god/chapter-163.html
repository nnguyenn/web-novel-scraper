  Chapter 163

  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  Chapter 163
 </p>
 <p>
  =Well, it’s almost the end of the BattleNet second half season in 2020, and the East Asia League is wrapping up too. Although South Korea won’t make it to the Champions League this season, we hope they can finish with a positive note.
 </p>
 <p>
  =The South Korean national team had a tough year, especially with the Sword King dominating in Japan, leading to a continuous losing streak. It seemed hopeless until the emergence of Seong Jihan, like a comet.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Yes, fortunately, thanks to Seong Jijan, we secured one victory, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  =Since then, facing both China and Japan, it’s been challenging for BattleNet powerhouses. Especially in Japan… with the presence of the Sword King.
 </p>
 <p>
  -The second Korea-Japan match of this season is near too.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the second South Korea-Japan match of the second half season, although the situation wasn’t as bleak as on August 15th, the overall expectation leaned towards a possible defeat.
 </p>
 <p>
  =In a clash between Seong Jihan and the sword king, who would have the advantage on the battlefield?
 </p>
 <p>
  =Well… the Japanese national team is a well-balanced team. Rather than having a specific strong position, they are all rated at least A level. However, their ranged firepower is definitely superior, so the outcome may depend on the map.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the South Korean national team is evaluated with S in ranged firepower, C in warriors, and A to B in support, Japan has a stable A to A+ level in all aspects. Therefore, on a typical map, Japan has the advantage. But on a map where the battle is determined at range, like the Train map, South Korea has the upper hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, this discussion is based on the assumption that the clash between Seong Jihan and the Sword King doesn’t decide the outcome.
 </p>
 <p>
  =If Seong Jihan and the Sword King’s battle determines the victory…
 </p>
 <p>
  =Then, naturally, the winner would take the game!
 </p>
 <p>
  If one of them wins, the game’s outcome will be settled there. The commentators discussed it as if everything was fine.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Seong Jihan… the opponent is the world’s strongest warrior. As a challenger, we hope you approach it with ease!
 </p>
 <p>
  =That’s right! Seong Jihan is still a Platinum player. If he grows to Diamond, eventually, he will be the world’s strongest. So, viewers, please support him regardless of the outcome!
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wait, why are the commentators talking like he already lost? Did they guys bet on the Sword King winning?
 </p>
 <p>
  -What are you saying? Though the objective data shows he’s at a disadvantage, I’ve never seen Jihan Oppa lose… He didn’t even lose to China, He’ll probably not lose this time too!
 </p>
 <p>
  Not just the commentators, but the viewers also had different opinions on Seong Jihan’s chances of winning.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan, don’t feel too burdened. I’ll support you with all my might.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, take it easy. The outcome isn’t the most important thing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Lee Hayeon and Coach Noh tried to alleviate the pressure on Seong Jihan, he was already full of thoughts about landing effective hits on the Sword King.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, I have to land a solid hit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Contrary to what they were thinking, Seong Jihan was determined to land a decisive blow on the Sword King.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, are you really going to… do ‘that’?]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Oh, the resistance has lessened up quite a bit now.’ Seong Jihan thought, recalling what happened 5 days ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  When he was debating whether to construct a wooden sword with the Branch of the World Tree or to complete the Crimson Thunder. An idea finally struck his mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s actualize the wooden sword.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if he completed the Crimson Thunder now, it would be hard to suppress the Sword King and feed him the leaves at the same time when there was still a slight gap between their powers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather than doing that, his goal was to mimic the wooden sword the High elf used and land a strong hit on the Sword King.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because the next Korea-Japan match will take place after this year.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, rather than clinging to complete Crimson Thunder, decided to focus on constructing the wooden sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  He first tried fusing the Power of life of the World Tree and the shadow energy, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  [Uh… Please stop, Master, every time the power of life enters.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Every time the power of life entered, Ariel’s resistance was palpable.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This… really doesn’t seem right. It feels like the foundation of the Shadow Elf is shaking. How about just manipulating the power of life? Yeah. How about experimenting with just one wooden sword?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel, wanting to do nothing with the vitality, suggested various ideas.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan did try obtaining a wooden sword once and imbuing it with the power of life as she said, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No, it doesn’t resemble the Branch of the World Tree. The wooden sword is not going to work.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [Th-Then how about growing seeds that come out when you emit the power of life? Let’s try cultivating that!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel tried various methods to avoid the power of life, but Seong Jihan’s determination remained unshaken.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Maybe because it’s inside the game, it’s not growing well,” he said as he tried various methods, but the green seeds grown with the help of the power of life showed no signs of germination. In addition, all the other methods tried did not disrupt Seong Jihan’s power.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It won’t work. Endure a bit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In the end, Seong Jihan threw a word at Ariel and continued the fusion.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ugh….]
 </p>
 <p>
  After 5 days of countless attempts, he succeeded in blending them to some extent
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Even though it still doesn’t look like the Wooden Sword… Let’s fight with this for now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  […Didn’t the Sword King say he’s the best warrior on this planet? When the power of life enters, the power of the Eclipse weakens. Since it’s not properly completed yet, how about saving it for the next opportunity?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Half conceding, Ariel responded as such, clearly not wanting the power of life .
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s fine. I only need to imbue it at the pivotal moment.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s mind was set on utilising it this time.
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  =The first map is South Gate.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Viewers are probably quite familiar with it now. It’s the map we’ve been in charge of for the first and second games in the second half of this season. We’re attacking.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Yes, Japanese team warriors. They’re blocking the castle gate. They don’t seem to be properly forming a formation.
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  =Uh… But the front-row warriors are each holding long nails instead of weapons…
 </p>
 <p>
  In front of the open castle gate of South Gate.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  When the ten Japanese warriors simultaneously pulled out the Sacrificial Nails they received from Shizuru.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t do that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sword King, who was standing at the front, stopped them with an unpleasant expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, Sword King…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Leave this game to me. Shouldn’t I be able to trample over him without any buffs?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Although he agreed to follow her words in front of Shizuru, He had the pride of being the world’s top warrior.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Even without that plan, I can easily win against him.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Using Sacrifice against a Platinum opponent?
 </p>
 <p>
  What would happen to the Sword King’s dignity?
 </p>
 <p>
  Although he was ‘obsessed’ with Shizuru, ‘submission’ had not yet taken hold of the Sword King.
 </p>
 <p>
  He would occasionally act impulsively like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The warriors also understood the Sword King’s feelings and held back from driving in the nails.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then step back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish! Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  The twin crimson and azure swords, Ganjang and Makya, rose behind Sword King’s back.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Split.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Sword King stretched his hand back…
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  The appearances of the azure sword Ganjang and crimson sword Makya faded, and in their place, spheres of azure and crimson light floated before the Sword King’s hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hundred Swords.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When the Sword King grasped the spheres of light with his hand…
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom! Boom! Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  Azure and crimson lights exploded in all directions, and one by one, swords began to take shape around him.
 </p>
 <p>
  100 swords of azure and crimson light.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah, that’s Hundred Swords! Seeing this I’m reminded of the Sword King’s MVP interview earlier this year!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Yes, I remember it too. He said he would dominate the battlefield alone by actualizing his twin swords, Ganjang and Makya, into a hundred swords. Even though he was on the Korean team back then…
 </p>
 <p>
  =Hahaha… He didn’t reveal Hundred Swords even in October’s match. To think he’s showing it to us now that we’re his opponent!
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish! Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  The hundred swords simultaneously flew towards the Korean team, and the Sword King followed behind them.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Absolute Barrier!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Korean supporters had cast a protective shield spell in advance, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  Crash!
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite its name, the absolute barrier tore apart like a paper scroll.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Hundred Swords, each possessing absolute power, were a force to be reckoned with.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘We’ll be swept away if I stay here.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Korean side, originally on the offensive, was now in a defensive stance. To face the Sword King, Seong Jihan stepped forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nameless divine art, Fusion of Divine thunder and phoenix: Crimson Thunder cannon
 </p>
 <p>
  A flashing crimson lightning bolt aimed at the Sword King.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmph.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The widely spread Hundred Swords quickly gathered and blocked the attack in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzt!
 </p>
 <p>
  Half of the hundred swords instantly lost their form and disappeared into light.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s quite powerful.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sword King raised his brows and waved his hand once again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish! Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  The swords that had melted away and scattered…
 </p>
 <p>
  Began to slowly regain their shape one by one.
 </p>
 <p>
  Blocking and regenerating no matter how many times the Crimson Lightning destroyed them, the hundred swords blocked Seong Jihan’s path.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red King rode on one of the light swords and flew towards Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Following closely behind were 99 other swords.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Hundred Swords moved freely under the Sword King’s control as if they were a part of his body.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s Phoenix flag flashed, firing the Crimson Thunder Cannon a few more times, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sword King alternated between blocking and dodging, closing the distance between him and Seong Jihan.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  ‘Thanks to the Hundred Swords, he’s much stronger than the data I’ve seen before.’
 </p>
 <p>
  While he was undoubtedly growing, the Sword King wasn’t just idling.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking that it wouldn’t be as easy as he expected, Seong Jihan tossed his Phoenix flag into the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nameless Divine Arts, Divine Thunder Decree – Celestial Judgment.
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzzt!
 </p>
 <p>
  A giant spear of light descended from the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  The point of the spear precisely aimed at the spot where the Sword King was advancing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What a trick.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Sword King raised his finger, the majority of the Hundred Swords flew towards the spear of light.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Sword King’s Hundred Swords… The transition between offence and defence is perfect.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Yes, and the pillar of light Seong Jihan revealed is also tremendously powerful! Sword King’s swords are being ripped apart!
 </p>
 <p>
  =However, is he momentarily held back by the swords? The falling speed seems to be decreasing…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The spear that seemed to land precisely on the Sword King’s path…
 </p>
 <p>
  While it did tear apart numerous swords of the Sword King, it couldn’t block his advance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  The spear of light pierced the ground only after the Sword King had already passed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Prepare for your first defeat.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Closing the distance, the Sword King spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  The hundred swords that had reformed after being destroyed unanimously flew at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching this, Seong Jihan casually raised a finger in the middle.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sword King’s eyebrows twitched.
 </p>
 <p>
  “A man who couldn’t even look me in the eye…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A father who went mad for a woman and abandoned his daughter has a lot to say.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have no daughter.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, while nonchalantly listening to the Sword King’s grumbling, sincerely contemplated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Was it right to heal this guy with the leaf of the World Tree?
 </p>
 <p>
  Would he even be healed?
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you want to be acknowledged as a father someday, cut off Shizuru’s head and come back. Otherwise, I won’t acknowledge you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan tried to compromise, saying he would consider accepting him back if he did this much.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This brat…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  At that statement, the Sword King’s eyes completely changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was indifferent to the story of abandoning his daughter, but the provocation related to Shizuru hit a nerve.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I guess I’ll have to go to Korea and kill you myself.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You talk big. Why not come for real if you’re so annoyed?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s mocking laughter triggered a fierce glint in the Sword King’s eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sword Sea.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The sword energy of the Hundred Swords overwhelmed the world like a tidal wave.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Phoenix Flag had already left, and Seong Jihan was left with only Eclipse in his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  To anyone watching, Seong Jihan was overwhelmingly at a disadvantage.
 </p>
 <p>
  However…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s weaker than I thought…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan blinked as he looked at the sea of swords.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sword King’s hundred swords.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There are lots of gaps between them.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The power was overwhelming, but it wasn’t flawless.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Get ready, Ariel.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [No. In this situation? Mixing power now would weaken the Eclipse’s power. Then I’d be buried in that sea of swords.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Certainly, the gaps in the Sword Sea were so fine that even the Shadow Elf Ariel couldn’t see them.
 </p>
 <p>
  But Seong Jihan, possessing the Martial Soul, had the eyes to perceive those gaps and the ability to penetrate them.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There’s a way. Let’s go give that bastard a blow he will remember for life.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [……If that is what you want, Master.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel responded in a somewhat resigned tone.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan chuckled and infused the sword with his energy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then…
 </p>
 <p>
  Nameless Divine Arts, Footwork Technique – Flashing Sky Thunder Steps
 </p>
 <p>
  “….!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan used the full force of the Thunder Steps, entering the Sword Sea.

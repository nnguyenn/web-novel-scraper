  Chapter 167
 </h3>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  Chapter 167
 </p>
 <p>
  A little while ago, after using teleportation to escape, Shizuru received a call from the Prime Minister while observing the Sword King’s hostage situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Miss Shizuru, how will you proceed now? If you provide your opinion, I will follow it accordingly.]
 </p>
 <p>
  With charm and obedience, the polite Prime Minister spoke. Shizuru sighed and replied.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, just wait a moment. I’ll prepare and go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you go yourself, it will be dangerous…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “There are other ways. Just give me some time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Understood!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Click.
 </p>
 <p>
  After hanging up the phone, Shizuru thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Enchantment is impossible now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Shizuru heavily relied on vision for her ‘Enchantment.’ If the Sword King hadn’t stabbed his own eyes, she would have tried various methods. But now, with his eyes gone, using enchantment was impossible.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I have to give up on the Sword King.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Shizuru quickly discarded any lingering attachment to the Sword King. While he was an exceptional player, the world was vast, and players with SSS-level gifts continued to emerge. Despite the intense competition between the Sword King and Seong Jihan, there were still many top-tier players globally.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aside from the Sword King and Seong Jihan who would be vigilant of her,
 </p>
 <p>
  There were still top-tier targets like Barren Williams of America with his two status windows, or China’s Wang Lin with the Heavenly Demon Body.
 </p>
 <p>
  She just had to keep a low profile for a while, then enchant those kinds of people again.
 </p>
 <p>
  However…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The problem is the immediate situation.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The fact that the Sword King was holding Japanese national team members hostage was a problem. Judging by his demeanor, if the real she didn’t show up, he might start killing the players.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the national team players were not particularly important to her, their deaths or survival influenced the country’s BattleNet rankings.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If they die, our country won’t maintain its BattleNet ranking…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Shizuru furrowed her brows.
 </p>
 <p>
  What a bunch of useless things.
 </p>
 <p>
  To all become hostages because of one Sword King.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should have built my power base in America.’
 </p>
 <p>
  But it was easier in her own country Japan, so she had established her foothold here.
 </p>
 <p>
  If she had known the players’ abilities were so pathetic, she would have gone to America earlier, would’ve enchanted people there, and settled down.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shizuru bit her lip.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Anyway, let’s go and die for now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Shizuru went down to the basement of her mansion.
 </p>
 <p>
  Multiple layers of security devices were installed in the underground space.
 </p>
 <p>
  Beep! Beep!
 </p>
 <p>
  [Fingerprint recognized, success!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Facial recognition failed!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Her face was damaged by the Sword King.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shizuru took out a mirror from the bag she brought and looked at herself.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not beautiful, not ugly.
 </p>
 <p>
  A very ordinary and plain woman’s facial features were reflected in the mirror.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Shizuru evaluated her own face in the past,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Edit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She changed her face again.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Facial recognition successful.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The secret chamber she entered in the basement was equipped with dozens of monitors, and a massive supercomputer was running, resembling a control room for a giant server. In the central part of the underground space, there was a person who looked exactly like Shizuru lying inside a glass container.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Every time I create a clone… I die. It’s quite troublesome.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Shizuru sighed in regret and opened the upper part of the glass container.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You. Go die quickly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, with a swish sound.
 </p>
 <p>
  The clone of Shizuru in the container stood up.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Once she dies, I’ll immediately release obsession.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Then the Sword King would probably think she was dead. No, he might try to find Shizuru by attacking, but he wouldn’t be able to reach this underground space.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll hide out here for a while.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Monitoring the Sword King’s broadcast, Shizuru decided to go into hiding for a moment. And in the Sword King’s BattleTube, when the clone she sent was stabbed by the hundred swords.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That’s it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  She smiled.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Now, let’s release obsession.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Once Shizuru died, and the ‘obsession’ status she somewhat incurred was released, the Sword King would likely think she was dead. It was a flawless plan. While thinking this, she reached out to release the Sword King’s status from this side.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  She saw a completely unexpected message.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The special ability of Ganjang and Makya, ‘The Defiant One’, has been activated.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The target does not accept removal of the ‘Obsession’ status.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Obsession’ will be maintained.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…This can’t be.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Shizuru’s face stiffened, completely astonished.
 </p>
 <p>
  Stab! Stab!
 </p>
 <p>
  As if indicating that no approach would be tolerated, the Hundred Swords pierced through Shizuru’s entire body. The woman who was once the world’s most beautiful died, buried under the sword in a gruesome manner.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not enough.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The hundred swords did not stop at simply stabbing her.
 </p>
 <p>
  They continued moving, brutally shredding Shizuru’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ew this is gross;
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -I thought I was used to BattleNet stuff but this is…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -The Sword King killed a person! The BattleNet Administration should immediately revoke his player qualifications!
 </p>
 <br/>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  -What revocation! This is justified revenge!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Ah. But does this mean we can’t see Shizuru anymore… that’s a shame.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Shame my ass, this feels fucking great
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -But she died so meaninglessly.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -I thought she would try enchanting again
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Is that really her?
 </p>
 <p>
  Various reactions were posted on the Sword King’s BattleTube about Shizuru’s death, but
 </p>
 <p>
  The blind Sword King obviously couldn’t see these messages.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead.
 </p>
 <p>
  “To die so easily…I can’t believe it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sword King! Now release the hostages! Hasn’t your revenge ended?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even after shredding Shizuru, he didn’t readily believe in her death and continued to observe the situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Status condition ‘Obsession’ is being released.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Hearing the system message with his lost vision.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘She’s really… dead?’
 </p>
 <p>
  He only now began to wonder if Shizuru’s death was genuine.
 </p>
 <p>
  Saving Japanese players as hostages and sacrificing herself in their place? It didn’t sound like her.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Could it be that I killed her before she tried anything…?’
 </p>
 <p>
  But since the system message had appeared,
 </p>
 <p>
  He had no choice but to believe she was dead.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The characteristic of ‘The Defiant One’ resists the release of the status condition ‘Obsession.’]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Will you resist?]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the trait of Ganjang and Makya, ‘The Defiant One’, activated.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sword King made an eerie smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yeah. You wouldn’t die so easily.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I resist.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The ‘Obsession’ status will be maintained.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The target of obsession is ‘Ito Shizuru’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  After hearing the message, the Sword King opened his mouth with conviction.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shizuru. Did you think it would be over by sending a clone and hiding? Your obsession with me… is still going strong.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is that supposed to mean…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A clone? Preposterous! Release the hostages immediately!”
 </p>
 <p>
  On the other side of the BattleNet Center.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Japanese side didn’t believe the Sword King’s words and protested, but
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehehe…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  Under the Sword King’s foot, swords gathered, and his body floated in the air. The signature skill, sword flight, of the Sword King. Along with that, the 20 imprisoned players also floated in the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where are you going?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why are you taking the hostages…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the leader of the JSDF special forces shouted, the Sword King spoke from atop the swords.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Release all except for the 20. I will take them with me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What… What?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s different from the promise!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If Shizuru dies, they will also be freed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You…! We can’t let you do that! We’ll open fire!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the special forces leader snarled,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then let them die.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Around the Sword King were 20 sword prisons, as if protecting him.
 </p>
 <p>
  If they fired, the hostages would die before the Sword King.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Tch…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  While grinding his teeth, the special forces leader could not stop the Sword King’s flight.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the swords flew, in an instant, the Sword King disappeared into the sky along with the 20 hostages.
 </p>
 <p>
  With that tremendous speed, the special forces leader twisted his expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That might actually be better…’
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how much they prepared special guns and ammo for top players.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the special forces clashed with such a monster, casualties would have been massive.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was fortunate that the situation did not escalate to such an extreme.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Enter the BattleNet Center.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The special forces leader turned his eyes away from the sky and, along with his team, entered the center to take care of the remaining hostages.
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  Haneda Airport, Japan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ve landed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…It’s the first time I’ve ridden in the cargo hold.”
 </p>
 <p>
  To secretly infiltrate Japan, Seong Jihan and Akari boarded the cargo hold together.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll explain the route from Haneda Airport. We’ll turn invisible here, and you’ll transform into a shadow to sneak out…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Before getting on the plane, she had done some research and was about to explain the route to Seong Jihan, but
 </p>
 <p>
  “No need. I’ll just go openly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “O-Openly?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. Once I meet up with my brother-in-law, people will know anyway.”
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  “But still…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The moment the cargo hold opened, Seong Jihan went out openly with her.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What, what is…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Se-Seong Jihan!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Airport staff were surprised to see them pop out of the cargo hold, but Seong Jihan ignored them and used a skill.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Summon Lightning Cloud.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A light yellow cloud appeared above Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzt. Zzzt.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackling sounds of intense electricity emanated from the surface of the cloud.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Get on.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan got on it and gestured to Akari.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Won’t I get electrocuted?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s okay for those I permit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jumping quickly onto the cloud, Akari looked down at her feet with wide eyes. As Seong Jihan had said, the electricity on the cloud did not affect her body.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where’s brother-in-law right now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He’s currently heading to Shizuru’s mansion.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s meet up with him there. Tell me the directions.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Go that way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Following Akari’s direction, the lightning cloud flew off swiftly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “H-He’s over there…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, he’s gone already…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The airport staff hastily called the airport police, but all they could see was Seong Jihan leaving.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then.
 </p>
 <p>
  The news that he had arrived in Japan quickly spread across both Korea and Japan.
 </p>
 <p>
  -I heard Seong Jihan went to Japan?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -OMG!! Did he skip the MVP interview and go secretly?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -They said he popped out of the cargo hold.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -He’s crazy, really. What kind of propulsion is that?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Uh, but isn’t it too dangerous?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Nah, If the Sword King and Seong Jihan join up, It’s Japan who will be in danger.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Koreans put aside their worries about the Sword King after hearing of Seong Jihan’s departure for Japan,
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wait, Seong Jihan… How long has it been since the game ended?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Let’s use this opportunity to wipe them all out! What are the special forces doing?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -The special forces might be overwhelmed…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -We should protest to the BattleNet management and suspend their player qualifications!!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Is protesting to the management the only hope for Japan?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Good. Send Seong Jihan to prison for illegal entry and execute the Sword King for murder.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -But who can catch them?
 </p>
 <p>
  Japanese people, despite their turmoil, realized the current situation was hopeless. If the Sword King joined forces with Seong Jihan, who could stop them? Even if the special forces were dispatched, the estimate didn’t look promising.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Just yesterday, we were celebrating being the top of the league and securing a spot in the championships…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Is this… a dream? Please tell me it’s a dream.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Shizuru’s mansion is collapsing!!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the situation escalated, some Japanese viewers found humor in the chaos, watching Shizuru’s mansion being bombarded on the Sword King’s channel.
 </p>
 <p>
  -What kind of enchantment did she use?Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -She should’ve brought Seong Jihan too!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Thanks to this, we’ve confirmed our lowest ranking in the league next season
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Around that time, the cloud carrying Seong Jihan and his party had already arrived at Shizuru’s mansion.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha… Haa… We’re here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh. I can see brother-in-law swinging his sword over there.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang! Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  As if declaring that not even pillars would be left, the Sword King bombarded Shizuru’s grand mansion with his swords.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, leading the cloud, approached the Sword King.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve come, Brother-in-law.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan respectfully greeted the Sword King like before. The Sword king was visibly surprised to hear that voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ji…Jihan? How did you get here so fast…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I just came quickly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Casually responding, Seong Jihan took out a leaf from the World Tree in his inventory.
 </p>
 <p>
  “For now, have this.

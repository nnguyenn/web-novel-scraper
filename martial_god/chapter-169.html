  Chapter 169

  <strong>
   Chapter 169
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  A remote island in the south of Japan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s group was looking at Shizuru who had washed up on the beach.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That was close, Shizuru. The effect of obsession almost disappeared, and I thought you might be dead.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That damned obsession…!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Shizuru’s expression twisted, instinctively reaching for her necklace. However, before her hand could touch the necklace, it stiffened and didn’t move.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ve finally entered my domain.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, blocking Shizuru’s movements, clenched his fist. Until now, due to her hurriedly teleporting every time he approached, he couldn’t confine her within his domain. Finally, reaching this uninhabited island, he could narrow the distance.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mmmph…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Attempting to say something, Shizuru…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Be quiet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a single word from Seong Jihan, she couldn’t even voice her thoughts.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan reached out in that state, the Aegis ring slid off Shizuru’s finger.
 </p>
 <p>
  He obtained the ring and checked the item description.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Aegis Ring]
 </p>
 <p>
  Grade: SSS
 </p>
 <p>
  -A ring that can summon the absolute shield, Aegis.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Enhanced by the power of the Akashic Page, the grade has increased by one level.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -The cooldown for summoning the shield is reduced from 1 day to 1 hour, and the defense of the shield is greatly enhanced.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Aegis. It was definitely SS-grade… did she enhance the item using the Akashic Page?’ Truly a tempting ability. However, he couldn’t afford to keep that dangerous woman alive.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The necklace is annoying too.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to take all the items she created.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The necklace can’t be used anymore…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The ‘Escape Necklace’ she had been wearing was SSS-rank, but
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps due to exceeding the base distance limit this time, it was damaged and could no longer be used.
 </p>
 <p>
  In case repairs might allow reuse, Seong Jihan put the necklace in a corner of his inventory before thoroughly searching Shizuru’s body using his domain control powers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon enough…
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  From her embrace, he could retrieve a single book.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Bringing a book while escaping hurriedly…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish! Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though it was in the water, the book remained completely dry. The faded pages flickered as they turned, and about ten sheets of golden shining paper remained at the end of the book.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Akashic Pages…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “She still had 10 pages left.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If he had caught her earlier, there would have been even more left.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan regretfully put the book into his inventory as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jihan, are you done?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. I’ve taken everything worth taking. It’s a shame about the GP that Shizuru owned, but there’s no need to leave any room for regret.”
 </p>
 <p>
  To receive GP transfer from Shizuru, Seong Jihan needed her to open the system and have the freedom to give items. However, granting such freedom meant not knowing what mischief she might cause. Seong Jihan decided to give up Shizuru’s GP to eliminate the afterglow definitively.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sure. You can earn GP on your own. Then… I’ll break our fate here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Having freed the remaining hostages in the sword prison before coming to this island, the Sword King fully summoned Hundred swords.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each sword emitted a powerful aura, seemingly ready to slay Shizuru on the spot.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, wait a moment. I’ll ask her one thing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Allowing Shizuru only to open her mouth, Seong Jihan questioned something he had been curious about.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you know about Succubus?”
 </p>
 <p>
  In his past life.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Apostle of the Apocalypse, Succubus Queen, who had descended on America looked extremely similar to Shizuru.
 </p>
 <p>
  Along with both using enchantment, he had guessed Shizuru must be connected to the Succubus Queen somehow, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh? Succubus? What kind of nonsense are you talking about?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Her response was a dismissive reaction.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why would I tell you if I knew?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, to die painlessly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you very much for your kindness sir. I wonder if I really do or don’t know?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Shizuru tauntingly asked Seong Jihan, but
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll find out about it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack! Crack!
 </p>

 <p>
  When Seong Jihan used the torture method, Peeling Tendons and Wrenching Bones, utilizing his internal energy.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aaargh! I don’t know! I really don’t know anything!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Unable to endure the pain for even a moment, she immediately answered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t know anything about Succubus! I know absolutely nothing about it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why does your edited face look so similar? Where did you get the image?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s a face I put my utmost efforts into creating!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Was your Editing Gift originally SSS-rank?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s…”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Shizuru hesitated for a moment in her response, her muscles twisted all at once. At the same time,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Heal.”
 </p>
 <p>
  To ensure she didn’t die yet, Seong Jihan applied healing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shizuru shed tears as she endured excruciating pain, and quickly answered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh…!! No. It was S-rank! I slowly raised the rank using Akashic Pages!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How did you know about the Akashic Page?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan asked about the Akashic Page, Shizuru couldn’t immediately respond. It seemed that she didn’t recall how she learned about the utility of the Akashic Page.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can’t remember that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It seems that way.’
 </p>
 <p>
  “I see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He hadn’t expected a candid answer, but she really doesn’t seem to know anything.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking she was useless to the very end, Seong Jihan spoke to the Sword King.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s enough.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wa-Wait a moment. Spare m…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Before she could finish asking for mercy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Stab! Stab!
 </p>
 <p>
  The hundred swords mercilessly pierced Shizuru’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  As swords pierced her from head to toe.
 </p>
 <p>
  Intense sword energy surged from all 100 swords.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shizuru’s entire body was instantly disassembled.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just a month ago, she had nothing to envy in the world. Now, not even her corpse remained intact.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The obsession has been removed. And the trait of Ganjang and Makya didn’t activate either.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The removal of the obsession completely verified Shizuru’s death.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hearing this through the system message, the Sword King collapsed on the beach, completely drained of strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Finally… she’s dead.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Akari, who had been watching from behind, spoke with a trembling voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Brother-in-law didn’t give you a chance to take your revenge.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… I’m sorry, Akari.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, just seeing her die is enough. But…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pointing to Shizuru’s fragments scattered on the beach, Akari said, “Can I burn those without leaving anything behind?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, Go ahead.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded. Venting her grudge against Shizuru like this might make Akari feel a bit better.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ninjutsu Red Flame.”
 </p>
 <p>
  While using the skill, Akari burned everything related to Shizuru.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  As she continued to watch the flames burning on the beach, her eyes widened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan-nim…! Shizuru’s blood isn’t burning. Rather…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Damn, why won’t she die nicely.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan promptly went over to take a look.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather than the blood disappearing amidst the flames, something seemed to be writhing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hellfire.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition to Akari’s flames, he used the Hellfire obtained from the Brahma God this time.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  Then, in the crimson flames, the blood that resisted began to burn slowly, and a red smoke rose into the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swooosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The smoke soon gathered and formed a single figure.
 </p>
 <p>
  The face of a beautiful woman, who had been edited by Shizuru all along, appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, there was a slight difference from her.
 </p>
 <p>
  The figure in the smoke had horns on both sides of her forehead.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking down on Seong Jihan’s group from the sky, she slowly opened her mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do not interfere.]
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That appearance. It’s exactly the same as the Succubus Queen. Indeed, Shizuru was related after all.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Given the identical appearance, there’s no way it’s not related to the Succubus Queen. As if Shizuru dying without knowing anything wasn’t unsettling enough, now that the Succubus Queen has appeared, Seong Jihan was somewhat pleased.

 <p>
  [I’m only here to take the soul of my contractor. I will not tolerate any further interference.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t want to.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He was glad to see her and all, but
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, it’s nice to see her, but Seong Jihan had to disrupt the Succubus Queen’s actions as much as possible. In the previous life, she charmed all of LA and manipulated America into nuclear bombing its own cities.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hmm… You all must have been her enemies. If I take her soul, she will suffer even in death. That would benefit you too, no?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who are you to say she’ll suffer?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I am the Apostle of Lust, Succubus Queen. This child will go to my palace and serve as my slave for eternity.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Answering Seong Jihan’s question obediently, the Succubus Queen readily revealed her identity.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Succubus Queen!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ito Shizuru made a contract with a being like that…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  While the Sword King and Akari were surprised by the mere existence of the Succubus Queen, Seong Jihan, nodding silently, continued to question.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But why, even though she made a contract with you, does she not know about Succubus?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [When the contractor made the contract, she wished for it. She said if she thought of me, she would willingly become my slave. She asked to erase her memory. It was a wise choice.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “But unconsciously, her appearance remained…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. She was a talented child. She skillfully crafted a similar appearance.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Though the Succubus Queen had obediently answered Seong Jihan’s questions so far, he continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why do you want to take her with you so badly?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I made a contract.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, it’s not just because of the contract. Is it because of the Gift ‘Edit’?”
 </p>
 <p>
  […Hm. Sharp. Yes, that’s right. The contractor possessed an extremely rare talent, even in the universe. It’s essential for my palace.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Gift ‘Edit’ A talent so rare even in the universe. Seong Jihan thought Shizuru did well to get rid of her.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swooosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  He drew the Phoenix Flag.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then I’ll do my utmost to interfere.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I don’t understand why you’re making such a reckless choice.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Because you said she’s indispensable to you, I really want to stop you somehow.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzzt…!
 </p>
 <p>
  As crimson lightning surged from the Phoenix Flag.
 </p>
 <p>
  For the first time, the previously composed Succubus Queen stiffened her expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  [What peculiar power… Indeed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, really? Have a taste of it then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Nameless divine art, Fusion of Divine thunder and phoenix – Crimson Thunder cannon
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan interrupted the conversation and initiated the attack. Roaring sounds echoed as crimson thunder poured out of the Phoenix Flag. It completely overwhelmed the Succubus Queen, who was nothing more than smoke, tearing her apart.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the crimson thunder passed, the face of the Succubus Queen, which had disappeared after being struck by the sword, reappeared, reshaping itself.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Brother-in-law, I’ll help too!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Following Seong Jihan, the Sword King simultaneously fired his hundred swords
 </p>
 <p>
  however…
 </p>
 <p>
  The Succubus Queen’s face disappeared when struck by the swords then regenerated again.
 </p>
 <p>
  [A demon’s contract is absolute… A powerful force indeed, but the task of guiding the soul cannot be stopped. Don’t bother me and leave.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite powerful attacks, the Succubus Queen quickly regenerated. She exhibited a tenacious vitality, even more so than when she descended upon LA.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Perhaps it’s because of her spectral form…? Even a crimson thunder should cause significant damage.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan furrowed his brow. Should he just let her take Shizuru’s soul? However, if the Succubus Queen took the soul and became stronger, she might return to Earth. Ultimately, humanity would suffer the consequences.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm…’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan contemplated how to prevent the soul from being taken, he suddenly recalled a certain martial art. In the Nameless Divine Arts, the most ambiguous technique, one that was most effective in capturing a spectral, formless entity.
 </p>
 <p>
  With his current level of power, it was still insufficient to use, but
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The target isn’t the Succubus Queen.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s target was the soul she had to retrieve.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Brother-in-law, lend me your swords for a moment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “S-Sure. Here it is.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He knelt on the ground, crossing the Ganjang-Makya and the Shadow Sword, plunging three of them into the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nameless Divine Arts, Annihilation God’s Secret – Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This is…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Whooooosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  As smoke rose from the swords, panic appeared in the Succubus Queen’s eyes for the first time.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Amidst the sea of stars.
 </p>
 <p>
  DongBang Sak was stroking his beard.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kirkk!
 </p>
 <p>
  Without realizing it, he flicked off a part of his beard.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Longinus. I understand your feelings.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hoho. You sensed it too?”Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes… It’s not pleasant at all. Is this the feeling of being robbed of karma……”
 </p>
 <p>
  Hoo!
 </p>
 <p>
  As DongBang Sak sighed, he looked up at the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Patience… is difficult indeed.”

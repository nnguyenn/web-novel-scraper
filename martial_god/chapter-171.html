  Chapter 171
 </h3>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  Chapter 171
 </p>
 <p>
  In front of the Sword Palace.
 </p>
 <p>
  Reporters were bustling, discussing the return.
 </p>
 <p>
  “He should be returning around now…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even if Seong Jihan uses force to paralyze us, we have to at least take photos no matter what.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Paralyze? It’d be an honor to be paralyzed by Seong Jihan-nim. Only then can we reporters say we’ve tasted some of his power.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, Reporter Kim. If it happens to me, please take a proof shot.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Not knowing about the existence of internal energy, they only knew Seong Jihan’s spatial control as “force”.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the reporters were annoyed every time their bodies were paralyzed by force, since Seong Jihan became a national representative, his popularity skyrocketed. Now, getting paralyzed by him was considered an honor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  And soon, a large limousine entered Sword Palace.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s the association’s car!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Click! Click! Click!
 </p>
 <p>
  The reporters completely swarmed around the car.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let me pass.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan came out of the car, he extended his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  As if Moses parted the Red Sea, the reporters’ bodies floated up on either side, creating a path.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was a method Seong Jihan commonly used when media coverage became too intense. He didn’t stop there; he even used force to subdue the reporters. However, the reporters’ reactions were odd this time.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Why do they seem to be liking it?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Their usual response was to frown or look scared before their bodies stiffened. But now, they were smiling and expressing joy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sunbae, please do it for me next time!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Click! Click!
 </p>
 <p>
  Junior reporters took pictures of the paralyzed ones.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  And following Seong Jihan, Sword King Yoon Sejin also got out of the car.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sound of flashes exploding from all directions intensified.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yoon Sejin-nim! Are you completely returning to Korea now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you have any intention of returning to the Korean national team?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How are your eyes?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Japanese BattleNet Association has suggested to the association that you committed murder! What do you think about this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Many questions were thrown at him, but the Sword King Yoon Sejin did not answer any other than saying,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Murder charge….”
 </p>
 <p>
  Slowly walking down the path opened by Seong Jihan, he opened his mouth towards the reporters.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I did not kill Ito Shizuru.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What…?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ito Shizuru isn’t dead?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. I just returned because I lost track of her. I failed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But the Prime Minister of Japan said that the enchantment was lifted, and Ito Shizuru was dead….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “She probably removed it to escape.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Speaking in a serious tone, Yoon Sejin recalled what had transpired just before.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  On the flight from Jeju Island to Gimpo Airport.
 </p>
 <p>
  Manager Park Yoonsik, assigned to Seong Jihan, had gone down to Jeju Island and briefed them on the recent situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Japan BattleNet Association is pushing for revocation of our qualifications?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Our representative is arguing vehemently that it’s nonsense, but public opinion isn’t positive. Especially the nations belonging to the Northeast Asia League are strongly claiming your qualifications should be revoked, so…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They’re just taking the chance.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin slowly opened his mouth. Although his beard was long, perhaps due to not shaving during the long chase, the eyes he had stabbed seemed fully healed. After eating the leaf of the World Tree given by Seong Jihan after Shizuru’s death, the originally gruesome appearance of his eyes had completely recovered. Of course, his vision hadn’t fully returned yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I killed her for my own survival… but it’s also true I committed murder. Punishment is unavoidable.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though players may kill enemies in games, committing murder in reality is an entirely different matter. Yoon Sejin, who had always emphasized the importance of law and regulations even from the early days of the BattleNet, seemed to acknowledge that he had committed murder and was ready to face the consequences.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Korean team will be fine with just Jihan. I was worried we might not win when I was enchanted in Japan because of Jihan. Whether I’m there or not, I believe the Korean national team will sail smoothly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Already anticipating that he won’t be part of the national team, Yoon Sejin was about to continue when, “Oh, no! I killed Shizuru…! Wouldn’t it be better if I did that instead?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll take the murder charges. I was useless in Japan anyway… So I want to do my part like this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a determined expression, Akari offered to take responsibility for the murder instead. Observing the atmosphere inside the upgraded airplane, Seong Jihan chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Brother-in-law, what are you saying? Ito Shizuru isn’t dead.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, that woman. She’s really persistent. After untying the enchantment, she disappeared. We searched all the way to the southern sea of Japan, but eventually, the Obsession was cut off, and we had to return home…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan snapped his fingers as he looked around at the people.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin and Akari.
 </p>
 <p>
  And Manager Park Yoonsik as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We failed. I lost track of Ito Shizuru, so we stopped pursuing her. You understand, right, Manager Park Yoonsik?”
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Park Yoonsik blinked blankly for a moment then quickly caught on to Seong Jihan’s words and answered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Y-yes! Ah, right. Ito Shizuru is tough, tough! It’s so regrettable. We should have completely uprooted her….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh… ‘Disappeared’ means she’s dead, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really, Akari. What are you talking about? We say she’s ‘missing.’ Your Korean is still a bit awkward.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah! I-I’m sorry….”
 </p>
 <p>
  Understanding Seong Jihan’s signal, Akari readily accepted it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing this, Yoon Sejin asked in disbelief.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jihan… Will that work?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If they’re already making baseless claims, we just have to respond in kind.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Forced situations call for forced measures, and Seong Jihan had plenty of experience dealing with dirty plays.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Besides, we have cards to play.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Cards?…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Soon, the Space League will begin.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “True.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The extensive tutorial was coming to an end, and the official opening of the Space League season was less than two months away.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even if Ito Shizuru didn’t die, if they continue to force issues from their side, we can issue a Space League boycott.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A boycott of the Space League… You won’t participate?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Park Yoonsik’s eyes widened.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Space League, the dream stage coveted by all players.
 </p>
 <p>
  To boycott that from the player’s side…
 </p>
 <p>
  “A player who was stripped of his national team status getting selected for the Space League? Does that make sense? According to their argument, it’s aiding and abetting murder. They need to reflect on their actions.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If… if they actually accept that and you change your mind…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I hope it comes to that. Playing matches without the world’s 1st and 2nd-ranked warriors will show how significant those vacancies are.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recalled the opening match of the Space League from his previous life. The overwhelming performance by the Sword King during the opening series. If he hadn’t been there, the battle against the World Tree Association would have ended in a mundane 3-game losing streak. If the side that won that game was Earth, the MVP would undoubtedly have gone to the Sword King.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I want to show clearly which side is more regrettable.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Although he had prepared a lot in this life to lead the opening match to victory, if the World BattleNet Association came out like that, Seong Jihan had no intention of being involved in the opening match.
 </p>
 <p>
  He wasn’t the type to just endure and let things pass.
 </p>
 <p>
  And according to the policy set during this time on the plane,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now, Japan, stop hiding Ito Shizuru and make her face the appropriate charges. If the BattleNet Association unreasonably listens to one side and issues an unfair punishment, I will boycott the Space League.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin threw a bomb in front of the journalists.
 </p>
 <p>
  “S-Space League…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A player boycotting the Space League…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A player without national team qualification, how will they represent Earth?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I also agree with that. According to the Japanese side’s argument, I’m also an accomplice to murder. It seems I don’t have the qualifications to represent Earth.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Those were Seong Jihan’s final words before entering the penthouse exclusive elevator with his group.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even Seong Jihan…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please tell us a little more!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The journalists who hadn’t stiffened up yet tried to approach, but blocked by the Force, they could no longer continue their reporting.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No… Shizuru didn’t die?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Boycotting the Space League…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The repercussions could be serious.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The reporters unaffected by paralysis began to release breaking news.
 </p>
 <p>
  [[Shizuru isn’t dead? The Sword King criticizes Japan for hiding her.]]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Sword King and Seong Jihan. They declare to boycott the Space League if their national player status is revoked!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The world once again began to stir with the news of the Sword King.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Damn, they’re going hard
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Boycotting the Space League?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Isn’t that obvious? If their national qualifications are revoked, telling them to play in the Space League is fucking nonsense
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -A while ago, there were unofficial reports from officials suggesting that if the Sword King performs well in the Space League, they might exempt him from losing his qualifications.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -So they were worried they might boycott huh
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -This kind of thing needs to be addressed firmly!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -If we lose in the Space League, we’ll be global outcasts, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  Koreans welcomed the news of the Space League boycott, however
 </p>
 <p>
  -Boycotting the Space League? No way!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -A BattleNet player not participating in the Space League…!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -It’s actually a relief. Even without Seong Jihan and the Sword King, Earth has plenty of talent!

 </div>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -No, the problem is that there’s no alternative for the Warrior class. You have to fully prepare and compete in the Space League!𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Have you not seen Seong Jihan and the Sword King fight? How do you expect to win in the league without those players?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Right! Isn’t it too hasty to revoke qualifications when it’s not even confirmed Shizuru has died?!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Do you believe that? If Shizuru hadn’t died, the Sword King wouldn’t have come to Korea!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Selfish Korean players! Refusing to do their job without thinking about paying for their sins…!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -As expected of the selfish murderer group, lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  While foreign reactions criticized the Sword King for declaring a boycott, there was also concern about losing the two strongest warriors on Earth from the Space League.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the impact of the Space League boycott declaration spread rapidly around the world, Yoon Sejin was meeting with his daughter.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah…”
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  The penthouse of Sword Palace.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin descended from the elevator with a trembling heart. What should he say in front of his daughter?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Do I even have the right to be here?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Feeling he had no face to see Yoon Seah, he thought it might be better that his eyes were gone for now.
 </p>
 <p>
  With those heavy thoughts, he moved his heavy footsteps.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Dad!”
 </p>
 <p>
  His unseen eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  But his daughter’s voice in his ears was still cheerful like in his memories.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Yoon Sejin, whose senses had become extremely heightened, could feel it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah taking deep breaths several times, composing herself and trying hard to sound cheerful.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How was… your trip?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Trip.
 </p>
 <p>
  She expressed the recent events with that single word while smiling.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah… I’m truly sorry…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why are you sorry! Don’t go getting enchanted on purpose!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Listening to that voice, Yoon Sejin lowered his head unconsciously.
 </p>
 <p>
  As if nothing had happened. As if nothing was different from usual. Seeing his daughter, who treated him, the father who had gone out and returned as if nothing had happened, he couldn’t raise his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking of the past when he was crazy about Shizuru and repeatedly said with his own mouth that he had no daughter, he couldn’t face her because he felt ashamed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah… it was an accident. And in the end, you came back! So it’s fine…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Forcing back tears, she looked at Yoon Sejin. Focusing her gaze on his eyes, she slowly approached him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your eyes… Are they okay?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No. Although I used the leaf of the World Tree for recovery, my vision hasn’t returned.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The leaves of the World Tree remove abnormalities and restore vitality. He consumed it on his way back, but his vision didn’t fully recover.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… If only you ate them a bit sooner…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah expressed her regret, but Yoon Sejin replied calmly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s okay. I deserved it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no regret at all in dealing with the consequences of piercing his own eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, really. How can it be okay…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry too much. There should be a way to restore his vision on the BattleNet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Re-really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If Uncle says that, there must really be a way!”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Yoon Sejin left Korea, in a desperate situation, her uncle resolved everything and even brought back her enchanted dad. Now, whatever Seong Jihan said, Yoon Seah trusted him absolutely.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But… Is that woman really not dead?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah cautiously asked, having watched the interview on TV on the first floor. Akari, who followed her, replied quietly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “She’s dead. She didn’t even leave a single drop of blood behind.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… as expected. I just wanted to make sure.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “She was a dangerous woman who, if left alive, could have caused trouble in the future.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right. Phew…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Only now did Yoon Seah breathe a sigh of relief. It was evident how much stress Shizuru had caused her.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, facing her, took out the Aegis Ring from his inventory and handed it to her.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh, this is…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Aegis ring. It’s noona’s keepsake. It’s a bit dirty because that woman used it, but let’s wash it clean and use it since it’s a SSS-rank item.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “SSS-rank?? Then I don’t need to wash it. Thanks, Uncle! Edit is useful at times like this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  While Yoon Seah was surprised reading the description of the modified Aegis Ring, Sword King, who had been silently listening, spoke up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah, do you need that right now by any chance?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, not really… I’m still ranked 1 anyway. Why, do you need it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Due to her Void Archer stats, she was still 1st place after promotion.
 </p>
 <p>
  When she blinked asking why, the Sword King slowly spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… I was thinking of using that ring to… look for your mother.”
 </p>

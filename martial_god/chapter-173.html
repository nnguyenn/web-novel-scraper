  <strong>
   Chapter 173
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  [Sword King joins expedition team for dungeon portal investigation! Effectively begins serving in the army.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Due to 6 months of suspended player qualifications, the combination of Seong Jihan and Sword King will be seen later than expected in the next season.]
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ah… He’s really unfairly treated… The World BattleNet Association didn’t do much when Shizuru was brainwashing people, but now they’re really harsh.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -But this should be enough to enter the Champions League next year.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Just entering the Champions League? We’re finally going to rank 1st in the league ahead of China! Hahaha!
 </p>
 <p>
  Koreans welcomed the news that the Sword King would still be able to participate, relieved that his qualifications weren’t permanently revoked.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh… He’s joining the expedition team? I hope we don’t get another Dungeon Break happening if they investigate North Korea again…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -The association’s satellite is supposed to identify the Abyss areas to avoid.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Satellites can see that?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Yup, the land turns purple apparently.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Eek, back then I thought the country was done for… I’ll never forget raiding the convenience store when that happened, haha!
 </p>
 <p>
  With expectations and worries intermingled, when the expedition team arrived in Korea and the Sword King departed with them,
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah smiled at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle~ You haven’t been playing much lately. At this rate, I’ll surpass your level!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What level are you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m 92.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…How are you leveling up so fast?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I think there’s a huge merit in being able to play two games a day.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It had only been 20 days since the promotion match, but Yoon Seah was growing rapidly.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  She was thoroughly enjoying the effects of her Late Bloomer gift.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your gift is C-rank now, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, the C rank effect is a bit disappointing, though….”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah showed her gift to Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  From F to D, the gift effects were so excellent that there was no room for complaints.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  But the C rank was a bit ambiguous.
 </p>
 <p>
  -C Rank Effect: Once a week, attempt to upgrade the skill grade.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike the previous ones, the C-rank effect has a very high level of randomness. Yoon Seah pointed at it with her finger, her lips protruding.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I tried it three times now, and it all failed! I don’t know if it’s actually upgrading.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re talking nonsense. In my opinion, that’s the most fraudulent thing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how random it is, the effect of upgrading the skill grade.
 </p>
 <p>
  Saying such an unreasonable effect existed, China’s Xin Youhwa once ranked 2nd in the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan scoffed at Yoon Seah’s complaining and looked at the Late Bloomer upgrade condition at the bottom of the gift explanation.
 </p>
 <p>
  B-rank upgrade conditions.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Available after tutorial completion.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can’t upgrade during the tutorial huh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, it’s a bit disappointing because it feels like my growth has stopped.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re growing at an incredibly fast pace… Don’t say that in front of others. You’ll get cursed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I know. I’m only saying this in front of Uncle, who is growing even faster than me. Of course, I’ll surpass you!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, you have to set high goals.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even if your level might actually be surpassed?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As time passed, the snowball rolled even bigger.
 </p>
 <p>
  With Void Archer, she was effortlessly securing first place.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it continued like this, she might actually catch up in levels.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, the actual skill level is still like heaven and earth. Hehe.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That… can’t be helped. Even if you try, you can’t catch up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re saying that very firmly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Because it’s the truth.”
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how good the Late Bloomer gift is.
 </p>
 <p>
  It couldn’t compare to Seong Jihan, who possessed the Martial Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Grow diligently and become a national representative next year.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it! Let’s go level up, Akari unnie.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, Miss Seah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Yoon Seah and Akari left the room.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No way I’ll let that punk surpass me so soon.’
 </p>

 <p>
  Seong Jihan checked his current status.
 </p>
 <p>
  His level was 124 now.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed destroying Shizuru’s soul with Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods and erasing the Succubus Queen’s remnant didn’t count towards leveling up requirements.
 </p>
 <p>
  After the promotion, he had leveled up 4 times during the Japan match, and had been stuck there since.
 </p>
 <p>
  Martial Soul naturally rose whenever he completed a martial art,
 </p>
 <p>
  And it had exploded from the stagnation, reaching 150 after using Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Still, I can’t be satisfied with this level.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan aimed to reach level 200 quickly. Thinking that he needed to resume his martial arts research, he logged into the BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was his first time logging in as a Platinum.
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as he entered, a new message appeared, different from usual.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have survived the Top 25 Promotion Match in the Space League.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The difficulty of NO.4212 ‘Humanity’ has decreased.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The player has fulfilled the opening conditions for the hidden option of the tutorial, ‘Rehearsal.’]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Rehearsal is a game where you can experience the maps used there before the opening of Space League.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Would you like to play Rehearsal?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [While Rehearsal is unlocked, the player ‘Seong Jihan’ cannot play regular maps.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Rehearsal?’
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like a rehearsal for a performance, just like its literal meaning. The BattleNet’s Rehearsal game appeared to be just that.
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s no need to skip this.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, I will.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan chose to unlock Rehearsal,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Player Seong Jihan is unlocking Rehearsal.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Only player ‘Seong Jihan’ can play Rehearsal maps.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Platinum-rank players may be randomly matched on Seong Jihan’s team to experience Rehearsal games.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A map only he could monopolize like the Throne of the Heavenly Emperor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet another one had appeared in BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The assigned map for the Rehearsal game is ‘Chaos Battlefield.’]
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking at the following message, he furrowed his brows slightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Of course, it had to be this map.’
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  The Chaos Battlefield, a map used in the Space League, was a map that humanity had never managed to win even once in Seong Jihan’s past life. And it made sense.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The map itself is too disadvantageous for humans.’
 </p>
 <p>
  True to its name, chaos reigned on this map. The terrain was constantly being destroyed. Enemies would pop out from all directions, and later on, the sky and ground would flip. Therefore, naturally, races capable of flight excelled here.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a battlefield where maintaining a formation was impossible. Seong Jihan recalled the human players scattering and getting annihilated each time. However, his perspective changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, it’s better this way.’
 </p>
 <p>
  After all, it was just a rehearsal. Losing wouldn’t affect Seong Jihan’s ranking in the Space League. It might be a good experience for people to realize how harsh the Space League was while playing this map.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Matchmaking for 500 Rehearsal participants on the Chaos Battlefield map has begun…….]
 </p>
 <p>
  And so, the matching process began. Seong Jihan stood on the black-stained ground, and in a flash, other human players were summoned near him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh… So it’s here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Rehearsal, how interesting.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan! It’s Seong Jihan again!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What did Seong do this time?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong! Can I get an autograph? SEONG? SUNG? How should I write it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Players rushed towards Seong Jihan, greeting him enthusiastically. The foreigners especially seemed more excited, asking for his autograph.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike usual matches where leagues differed, preventing them from playing together,
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed players were matched globally for this Rehearsal map since it recruited 500.
 </p>
 <p>
  “SEONG.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After reaching Platinum in the Space League, Seong Jihan was practically a global star akin to BattleNet Star. Used to such popularity even in his past life, he calmly signed autographs for the players flocking to him.
 </p>
 <p>
  While doing so, he surveyed the summoned players.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Not many are coming.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As the player recruitment for this map took longer than expected, Seong Jihan turned on BattleTube.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hello, everyone. It’s been a while.”
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh, BattleTube is finally on!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -It’s been days, seriously…I couldn’t watch the broadcast because of Shizuru… it was so empty .
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Seong Jihan!! If you headbang, I’ll sponsor you with the Sword King’s GP!!
 </p>
 <p>
  [SwordKingFan1 donated 100,000 GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Thanks to you, we can cheer for the Sword King again. Really grateful!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [SwordKingFan2 donated 100,000 GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [I was waiting to donate the moment you turned it on!!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Like that, SwordKingFan1 to 11 each donated 100 million.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Whoa, so many SwordKingFans lol
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -They are no longer the SwordKingFans
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -1.1 billion… Is this real?
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, looking at the massive donations, finally opened his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thanks for the donations. But SwordKingFans, I’m fine so please support my brother-in-law now. Shizuru took all his assets, he only has 1 million GP left.”
 </p>
 <p>
  -1 million GP is still a lot, no?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Considering the Sword King’s assets were in the trillions… Having that little left, the feeling of loss must be immense.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Ask him to turn on his broadcast!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -We want to donate but can’t…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… Why isn’t it turning on? I’ll ask him about it later.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the SwordKingFans’ donations ended,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh cool, Seong turned it on!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The players gathered around him noticed his BattleTube was on and cheered, making V-signs.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m appearing on Seong’s broadcast!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “My name’s Michael, remember me everyone!”
 </p>
 <p>
  On Seong Jihan’s channel, now firmly established as BattleNet’s hottest broadcast.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were elated to appear on it.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Uh, who’re these guys?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -So many foreigners??
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers were annoyed as the foreigners blocked the screen, causing a ruckus.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Um, we came to see oppa Seong Jihan -_- Move your ugly faces and piss off.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Michael? Why’s he acting so familiar lol
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -What is this, a fan meeting? What’s going on?
 </p>
 <p>
  To the confused viewers, Seong Jihan explained the current situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “When I logged in today, a new special map opened up. So I immediately tried it out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He then briefly explained the Rehearsal map, and said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Since there aren’t 500 yet, Platinum players who haven’t started the game, let’s play the rehearsal map together.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Through his broadcast, he sent out a global recruitment advertisement to Platinum players.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Whoa, a Rehearsal…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Seong Jihan’s channel really shows all kinds of things;;;
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Seriously, he plays a totally different game.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Then, like last time, will extraterrestrial races appear in this game?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -If those guys come out, we might get wiped out… wouldn’t the players actually needs to avoid it?
 </p>
 <p>
  Some viewers expressed concerns.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash! Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as Seong Jihan finished his story, the rate of Platinum players joining increased significantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “A rehearsal… it’s interesting.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Experiencing Space League before Diamond!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Some joined to experience the new map.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I came prepared for a level downgrade. Please give me an autograph to me too!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Some Platinum players joined one after another to see Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once 500 players were gathered,
 </p>
 <p>
  [500 players have been matched.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The game will start.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The assigned map is ‘Chaos Battlefield.’]
 </p>
 <p>
  The game began instantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Removing BattleNet’s shield.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Shhh…
 </p>
 <p>
  With that message, the wide-spread shield protecting the 500 humans on the black land was lifted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, we start here? I thought it was a waiting area.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Chaos Battlefield… the name sounds grand.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But it doesn’t look like much….”
 </p>
 <p>
  Under the sun in the sky, the endless black land stretched out. As players looked around to grasp the map, Seong Jihan gazed at the sky and furrowed his brow.
 </p>
 <p>
  This damn map, already…!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Everyone, prepare defenses!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Supporters, set up barriers, and warriors, block the sky. They’re coming soon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  What’s in the sky?
 </p>
 <p>
  As the players looked up confusedly at the clear sky,
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  Kaaaahhh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Along with a scream that seemed to tear their eardrums, Enormous flames poured down towards the 500 humans.

  [Epic Quest]
 </p>
 <p>
  -Find the ‘Fragment of the Fallen Star’ hidden within the Chaos Rift.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Reward: Achievement Points 1,000,000.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Extend the Level Cap by +50.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Additional rewards based on the discovered Fragment of the Star.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A Fragment of the Fallen Star, huh? A fallen star. I guess it refers to a planet that got eliminated in the Space League, just like Earth in my previous life.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The violet-hued crack in the ground, seemingly bottomless, indicated an atmosphere of forbidding. Moreover, the light emitted from the crack wasn’t ordinary, reminiscent of the deathly aura used by the Constellation of the Dead Star.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If it was a regular Platinum player, they wouldn’t even dare set foot inside.’
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the crack held a unique glow.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But compared to what Karlein spewed out, it’s nothing.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan lightly jumped into the rift.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kieeek, kieeek…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Then countless chimeras spewed out from inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Annoying.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom! Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  But Seong Jihan smashed the small fry without even swinging his weapon, just using his domain’s power.
 </p>
 <p>
  After ten minutes passed:
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh… I was wondering why he fell into the rift, it was just to raise his kill count more lol
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -He’s already at 2014 points. Crazy!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Seong Jihan is solo carrying humanity to 7th place already
 </p>
 <p>
  The kill points for humanity had reached 2014. Out of 500 members, only Seong Jihan had earned points.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Next time, should Seong Jihan just solo-hunt in that hole to reach 10,000 points?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -No, isn’t that too much of a burden on Seong Jihan-nim? The team members are just freeloading too much.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Jihan doesn’t seem bothered at all….
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -He’s just standing there while monsters keep spewing out
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers realistically said Seong Jihan should jump into the fissure alone now and score 10,000 points to clear the special mission, but
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have obtained the maximum points available from the Chaos Rift.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [No more kill points will be accrued.]
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ugh, can’t suck anymore honey.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -In the end, we’ll have to fight other species to reach 10,000.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Ah, that’s true. Just looking at the entire team, it’s not bad.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Only Seong Jihan worked hard and the team members got all the honey
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite gaining 2000 points from the chimeras, they felt disappointed when the system imposed limitations.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm, I guess I can’t end it all in one go with just one rift.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was disappointed as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan had hoped to complete both the rehearsal special mission and the epic quest at once. However, he hadn’t anticipated such constraints from the system.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, then I need to quickly find the Fragment of the Fallen Star now. In the next game, I’ll have to aim for 10,000 points.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With this thought in mind, Seong Jihan searched through the rift, but all he found was a violet glow with nothing else around.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There’s not much time left.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Summoning the Lightning cloud, he attempted to explore faster, but the landscape remained unchanged as he descended.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, there was one change: as he went deeper, the chimeras below started speaking.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Kill… me….]
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  [I don’t… know…]
 </p>
 <p>
  The chimeras, which had initially made animalistic sounds, began to articulate words as Seong Jihan descended further.
 </p>
 <p>
  And unlike the chimeras spewing out from above.
 </p>
 <p>
  These beings were like souls without forms.
 </p>
 <p>
  And going even deeper.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Please… don’t merge us… it hurts too much…]
 </p>

 </div>
 <br/>
 <p>
  [Please! Hasn’t it all ended… haven’t we perished? If we’ve perished, let us remain as we are…]
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  [Why do you keep asking about things we don’t know?]
 </p>
 <p>
  It was not the chaotic mix of chimeras from before. Instead, beings of different races spoke individually, each radiating light while emitting pained pleas.
 </p>
 <p>
  Listening to their words translated through BattleNet, Seong Jihan could confirm his guess was right.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘As expected, these are species relegated from the Space League….’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recalled the last day before his regression when humanity lost in the demotion match. He thought that everyone, except him, was literally “deleted.” However, it seemed that in places like this Chaos Rift, they continued to branch off.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But what are they asking that gets such a response?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Apart from the usual request for death, there were many responses of “I don’t know” to some specific questions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan tried to go deeper to hear what exactly they didn’t know, but
 </p>
 <p>
  [15 minutes have passed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [NO.4212 ‘Humans’ are being expelled from the Chaos Battlefield.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Time was already up.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Calculating the score for humans……]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The kill points have exceeded 2000.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Congratulations. You have earned the right to receive participation rewards!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Death penalties are waived for all participants.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [All participants are exempt from death penalties.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [All players’ levels increase by 1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [All players receive 100,000 GP..]
 </p>
 <p>
  If they achieved only 2000 points, they received a participation reward.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Isn’t that… lame??
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Well, those teammates who couldn’t kill enemies didn’t get level downs, right?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Oh, right. If you look at it as a team, it’s not bad.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Seong Jihan suffered, and his teammates took all the honey, haha!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Honestly, if you have a conscience, you should sponsor 100,000 GP to Seong Jihan right away.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Who saved them from de-leveling.
 </p>
 <p>
  The 500 team members, who couldn’t contribute much, not only gained a level but also acquired GP.
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers said they should donate to Seong Jihan out of conscience, but
 </p>
 <p>
  [Additional rewards are obtained based on contribution.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Player ‘Seong Jihan’ has achieved 100% contribution, the first in the rehearsal.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Level increased to 4.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Gained 4 million GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [As a one-time reward, receive 4 additional stat points.]
 </p>
 <p>
  -Whoa, additional stats given too?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -This reward is insane!
 </p>
 <p>
  Other rewards were not bad, but everyone’s attention was on the 4 additional stat points. Considering the nature of BattleNet games, it’s almost impossible to obtain this.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But achieving 100% contribution for the first time in the rehearsal, haha!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -No, isn’t that too much for the teammates!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -No, no, it turned out well encountering crap. Our bro gained additional stats, and viewers who like humanity just ankle-biting are happy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather than complaining, viewers were happy the useless team members allowed Seong Jihan to gain additional stats.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, Seong Jihan’s current emotions were useless due to his Soullessness, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have achieved the special accomplishment ‘100% Contribution’]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have earned 300,000 achievement points as a reward.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the achievement points reward that only he could see, Seong Jihan smiled. In times like these, teammates who seem unhelpful can turn out to be beneficial. Still…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Next time, I should be more careful in team selection through matchmaking.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He recalled the events from a while ago. Dozens of chimeras emerging, teammates perishing. Witnessing the collapse in such a desolate manner was not something he wanted to see again.
 </p>
 <p>
  He gained the most important one-time reward and additional stats. Now, he needed to prepare properly and assemble a team.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite leaving with such a light-hearted mood…
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, this can’t be…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A map where you can gain additional stats…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Moreover, it’s 7, 7!”
 </p>

 <p>
  The BattleNet industry began to buzz with excitement as they witnessed the rehearsal game.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  [Map exclusively opened for Seong Jihan, Rehearsal! What are the results of experiencing Space League indirectly?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tremendous rewards await on the Chaos Battlefield! But the enemies are equally challenging.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [A game where Seong Jihan shines alone with 100% contribution, is this okay? The fate of humanity is vividly revealed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do you become a chimera if you’re demoted in the Space League? The eerie cries of souls within the chaos of the rift reveal the horrifying truth.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now reporters just write articles directly based on uncle’s games.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah looked at the front page article on the portal site with eyes that were now accustomed to it. Although it had been a while since the lively BattleTube broadcast, Seong Jihan’s popularity stood out among all BattleTubers, especially during this time when curiosity about the main game of Space League was growing as the tutorial ended. When the rehearsal game opened, the attention of people worldwide was inevitable.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But if we really get demoted… Do we become chimeras?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is it because of the dialogue of souls within the rift?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, isn’t it intriguing? All sorts of speculations are rampant now. What does it mean not to know? Whether we really face destruction if we get demoted.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Among Yoon Seah’s questions, Seong Jihan knew the answer to the latter. While sipping his coffee, he casually replied, “Yes, it’s true that destruction awaits if you get demoted.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh… really? How does Uncle know that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just a hunch.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh… well, if you say so.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right. Should I ask Ariel?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel, who was almost like a BattleNet expert, shook her head when asked about it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have an idea, but… I’m not sure exactly what happens when you get demoted.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really? I thought you had information.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shadow Elves have never been demoted.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh, tough luck.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you see the game earlier? The importance of the race is significant.”
 </p>
 <p>
  To Yoon Seah’s jeers, Ariel shrugged her shoulders.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But isn’t it too much to play a game with the dragon race?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Players who play games with Uncle also talk about the same things. Aren’t you not doing well these days?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh… that’s true, but…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “In the first place, BattleNet is not a fair game. The basic purpose is to instigate fights between planets. You should consider yourselves lucky that there were only 500 dragons missing earlier.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel, standing in front of the computer, continued, “Can I replay the video?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle’s BattleTube? Yeah, go ahead.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, after quickly skipping through the playback screen, she stopped at the scene where Seong Jihan went deep into the chaos rift.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the scene of souls screaming before being fused into chimeras.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master, may I send this scene to the Queen?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Shadow Queen?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. The violet energy entangling that soul… it seems like it could be a clue for the Queen to advance her shadow energy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That thing resembles the death energy used by the Constellation of the Dead Star.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so? May I also send your comments along?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wouldn’t do it for free.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course. The Queen will pay an appropriate price.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though she could have sent it without saying anything, the fact that they were offering a reward made it hard to refuse.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright, send it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel spread the shadow energy on the monitor, absorbing it again.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, I’ll go to send it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel disappeared somewhere.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan grinned as he watched his video again. When he first experienced it, that was like a panel of escalating death energy. Was there something related to the shadow energy?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I was too focused on Shadow Eclipse.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Since Shadow Eclipse’s evolution had stalled,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to ponder over Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods’ evolution, which he had neglected until now.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he could develop this while raising his Martial soul,
 </p>
 <p>
  He could then upgrade Shadow Eclipse based on that strengthened ability.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Also, to break the Epic Quest, situations like today, where allies are slaughtered en masse, should not happen. It’s not just a small number, but 500 people. It’s a bit strange.’
 </p>
 <p>
  To select elite players from the 500 Platinum players who can withstand the Chaos Battlefield, it was impossible with only Korea’s player pool. He would have to select players from all over the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  While contemplating how to solve the recruitment problem, he received an urgent call from Lee Hayeon, the guild master.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Owner! The World BattleNet Alliance contacted me!]
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a hastily delivered call related to the Chaos Battlefield.
 </p>
 <p>
  [They said they had something to discuss regarding the Field of Chaos….]
 </p>
 <p>
  The World BattleNet Alliance they had an uncomfortable relationship with due to the Sword King issue.
 </p>
 <p>
  But perhaps because of the Chaos Battlefield’ too enticing rewards.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a matter of who gained the upper hand in such situations.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sure, let’s hear what they have to say.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The authority to open the Rehearsal Map alone – Seong Jihan decided to make good use of it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to make full use of the authority to open Rehearsal maps alone.

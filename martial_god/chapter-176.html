  Chapter 176

 <p>
  Chapter 176
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s channel broadcasted the rehearsal game live. The ripple it created continued to grow. Experiencing the Space League game that had been shrouded in secrecy captured the public’s interest, but what truly grabbed attention was the reward for achieving 10,000 kill points. It granted all participants a stat point increase of +7 and an immense reward of a growth bonus for Earth players for the next five years.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Growth bonus… That’s incredible!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Isn’t the immediate stat point +7 more valuable?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -No, in the long run, the 5-year growth bonus might be better.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -We need to build a proper team and somehow achieve 10,000 points!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -With Seong Jihan, humanity just needs to survive, right?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Seriously, let’s ride the bus properly. Fasten the seatbelt, at least.
 </p>
 <p>
  With rewards tantamount to global bonuses, viewers from all around the world united their voices, emphasizing the need to form a dream team. And in the midst of this public sentiment, the World BattleNet Association naturally caught wind.
 </p>
 <p>
  “For this game, the Association must take an active stance.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The rewards from the Rehearsal map were under heated discussion at the World BattleNet Association.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The rewards from the rehearsal map are enormous. For the sake of humanity, we must definitely achieve 10,000 points.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Since Seong Jihan is so powerful, the remaining 500 team members just need to stay alive. We should select players focused on warriors and supporters, ensuring we endure for good results, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We need to form a team in the Association that can synchronize with Seong Jihan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The selection should be entirely done by the association.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The main focus of the meeting was that the player selection should be handled by the association.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, it’s a bit awkward after the incident with Seong Jihan and the Sword King…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But we agreed to end that matter amicably, didn’t we?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes! How lenient was the punishment for the Sword King, ending with exploration in the North Korean dungeon?”
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  While some attendees were concerned about Seong Jihan’s relationship, the prevailing opinion was that the association had shown leniency, so there was nothing to worry about. Especially the countries in Northeast Asia that had tried to suspend the Sword King from participating by any means—China, Japan, and Russia—all argued that player selection should be strictly handled by the association.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If it’s left up to Seong Jihan alone, he could discriminate based on nationality when selecting players.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right! The Association must secure player selection authority!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, the World BattleNet association sent a representative to Korea to gain the authority for player selection in the rehearsal map. After three days, in the Daegi guild office of Sword Palace:
 </p>
 <p>
  “Pleasure to meet you. I’m Nicolas Joseph, Deputy Director of the World BattleNet Association Foreign Affairs Division.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Association representative had arrived.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Nicholas Joseph, a middle-aged African American man wearing glasses, extended a handshake to Seong Jihan in fluent Korean. Despite his position as deputy director, Nicholas’s substantial build made him seem more like a bodyguard than a department head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Association has great interest regarding this Rehearsal game. You’ve already played three games before I came to Korea… but didn’t achieve significant results.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You watched the matches?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What Earthling isn’t watching your matches these days, Seong Jihan-nim.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Nicholas chuckled, revealing his white teeth. As he mentioned, upon receiving the World BattleNet association’s contact at the Sword Palace, Seong Jihan had tried to gather a Platinum elite team from the guild within the three days before Nicholas’s arrival.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It wasn’t easy.’
 </p>
 <p>
  There were two ways to gather party members for the rehearsal game: either through random matchmaking or by Seong Jihan opening the team and selectively choosing players. Despite trying the latter for three days:
 </p>
 <p>
  [I may be only level 170, but… I can try my best! Please pick me!]Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  [Wow!! It’s Seong Jihan!! I have to take a picture! Hehehe!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Can I get an autograph?]
 </p>
 <p>
  There was chaos, and kicking out such people without hesitation and starting the game only with players above level 200 took quite a bit of time. And even then:
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’re not covering me with your shield?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You call yourself a Warrior and can’t even tank that?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Our coordination as a team is completely off…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Even with players approaching Platinum max level, the timing of the team’s annihilation didn’t differ much. The chimeras from the Chaos Rift were manageable, but during the confrontation:
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ah crap, the ground’s shaking…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  When an earthquake occurred, and rifts emerged from all sides, the formation broke, and they were slaughtered by the chimeras again.
 </p>
 <p>
  With Seong Jihan alone unable to completely block these situations arising for 3 straight days,
 </p>
 <p>
  -Damn, are we seeing humanity’s limits here?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Now I see why the 10,000 point reward is so good. It’s impossible huh?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Unfair that the dragon race gets points from their racial bonus while lower races suffer discrimination here too
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -World’s still the same even in space huh. Annoying.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Hey, don’t wanna end up as a chimera too huh?
 </p>
 <p>
  Expectations for the 10,000 points gradually faded away. Having witnessed the entire process, Nicholas, who came to the Daegi guild, could confidently open his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “At this rate, it’ll be difficult for you to obtain those 10,000 points.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “So?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Our Association will actively support you, Seong Jihan-nim. We will gather the elites among Platinums and thoroughly build teamwork before participating, to ensure success.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Many players ranked in November’s promotion match have expressed their willingness to forfeit and participate in Rehearsal instead. The players you’ve brought so far were certainly skilled, but as you know, in BattleNet… whether teamwork is built makes a huge difference. For the Association’s founding ideals and humanity’s sake, we will form a team capable of clearing the Rehearsal map.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The World BattleNet Association requested authority to select players themselves like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’d be convenient to hand it over.’
 </p>
 <p>
  After trying to recruit members himself these past 3 days,
 </p>
 <p>
  Frankly, handing it over was 100 times more convenient for Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, it’d be somewhat easier if the Daegi guild itself handled selections, but
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s challenging to add this on top of guild responsibilities…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, given the Association’s strong authority, trying to oppose them would be difficult. As an officially recognized organization in BattleNet, it was best to work together while respecting each other’s rights.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that all?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Pardon?”
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no need to go out of his way to accommodate them. Seong Jihan thought he should receive everything and deal on an equal footing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Since you asked for the authority to select the team, there should be something in return.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing he was speaking so openly, Nicolas subtly smiled.
 </p>
 <p>
  As expected of Seong Jihan, frank as ever.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had no hesitation bargaining even against an Association representative like himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, I didn’t mention that. The Association has decided to completely revoke the Sword King’s punishment from before. As long as he investigates North Korean dungeons until December, he can return to the national team anytime afterwards.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Their souring with Seong Jihan was due to the Sword King issue.
 </p>
 <p>
  So by rolling this back, they thought relations could improve again.
 </p>
 <p>
  While acting as if they were giving something incredible, the Association made this proposal to Seong Jihan, but
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I don’t need that.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In the first place, it was just lip service.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Association was already providing infrastructure for the Sword King’s desired northern investigations.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rolling this back would disadvantage them instead.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, the Sword King joining the national team earlier meant steadily ranking 1st from March onwards, but
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘One 1st place in March, one later. Making the Champions League is the same.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to take what he wanted from the Association instead.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s fine.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Pardon…? It’s fine?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Brother-in-law also said he wants to investigate dungeons a bit more. Instead, designate our guild as ‘World Guild of the Year’.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh… That’s…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Nicolas adjusted his glasses.
 </p>
 <p>
  World Guild of the Year.
 </p>
 <p>
  Being selected among the top 100 guilds worldwide gave +2 increases to all guild option levels.
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to Seong Jihan’s Phoenix Flag, the effect was only half, but
 </p>
 <p>
  Lobbies to obtain this spot flooded the World BattleNet Association.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The selections have already been decided…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Out of the 100 spots, exclude one from the Northeast Asian countries. Then I’ll accept players from that region into the team.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Uh… from Northeast Asia?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you think I’d just join without reason? Doing that kind of thing?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Nicolas couldn’t respond to Seong Jihan’s retort.
 </p>
 <p>
  China, Japan, Russia, even Taiwan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Everyone knew just how hard those Northeast Asian countries pushed to get both the Sword King and Seong Jihan banned from the national team.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood… We’ll include the Daegi guild in the ‘World Guild of the Year.'”
 </p>
 <p>
  Delegated with significant authority from the association, Nicholas confidently agreed on their behalf.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They really want those player selection rights.’
 </p>
 <p>
  7 stat points was enough to make your eyes pop out.
 </p>
 <p>
  He could have pushed for more concessions from the Northeast Asian countries, but Seong Jihan decided to let it go for now.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I try to completely exclude the Northeast Asian countries with this, I might face a backlash from public opinion. Winning over the global audience is more important.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With that thought, Seong Jihan requested a few more things from the Association representative.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, and we’ll select about 20 members from our guild as well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “And…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “And…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan’s requests continued, Nicholas wore an uneasy expression. However,
 </p>
 <p>
  “And make sure to put me in the lineup for the Space League opening match without fail.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Surprisingly, this last request was more in line with what the association desired. Who wouldn’t pick the warrior competing for the top spot globally in the world?
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll request that from our side.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I said ‘without fail.'”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking that this was the easiest demand among them all, Nicholas confidently responded.

  [World BattleNet Association announces formation of dream team for Rehearsal!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Platinum players over Level 200 forfeit the November 25th promotion match and begin challenging Rehearsal one after another.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Don’t attack, just endure! The classes the Association is selecting are focused on Warriors and Supporters.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [World BattleNet Association also announces inclusion of the ‘Daegi Guild’ among the ‘World Guilds of the Year’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  -So the Association is selecting players in the end.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -That’s for the best. When Seong Jihan selected, It was a mess. People asking for autographs left and right…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -But seems they made a deal, exchanging that for the World Guild of the Year spot?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Taiwan is going crazy now. The guild that was supposed to enter the World Guild of the Year got rejected.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Taiwan demanded Seong Jihan’s qualifications be revoked along with the Sword King. That’s what you get for flapping your mouth.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Ugh, unfortunately we can’t exclude Japan. Their lobby power is top-notch.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh… With all the articles about Uncle, my victory article is so short!”
 </p>
 <p>
  November 25th.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having finally reached Level 100, Yoon Seah pouted while looking at the portal site’s front page article after winning the TOP 100 Gold promotion match.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You have articles too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Heavenly Demon’ Wang Lin, ‘My Status Window’ Barren too couldn’t get 1st place! Upsets abound in this promotion match!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Game’s ruined! Yoon Seah, winner of the match, gets spammed with malice from across the globe on her BattleTube.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Gold Top 100 Promotion Match worldwide.
 </p>
 <p>
  This Promotion Match was highly anticipated with many candidates for victory.
 </p>
 <p>
  With Seong Jihan advancing first, and late bloomers Barren and Wang Lin.
 </p>
 <p>
  Plus rapidly leveling up soccer’s god Diego Masied.
 </p>
 <p>
  While many players were touted as potential winners,
 </p>
 <p>
  The actual winner was Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  She played so disgustingly, repeatedly hiding and shooting from the Veil of Void, making viewers hate her to the point of leaving nasty comments all over the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  [How…!! Even to his niece…!!]
 </p>
 <p>
  After hearing Barren’s scream last, she was able to seize the win.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a result, her BattleTube was being bombarded with negative comments from netizens worldwide, despite the usual opposition between China and the United States.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehe, negative comments… Isn’t that a compliment? Isn’t playing dirty in the game praiseworthy?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah chuckled while watching the worldwide terror of negative comments on her BattleTube.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, she was immune to mental damage from negative comments. Instead, she reached a point where she laughed while seeing them.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Compliments indeed. Especially when they’re cursing in a foreign language.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, yeah. It feels like I’ve accomplished something.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The uncle and niece shared a moment of understanding about negative comments.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, but it’s a shame~ They said they wouldn’t pick Archers for the rehearsal.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah expressed her disappointment while reading the article.
 </p>
 <p>
  She had rapidly climbed up to Platinum, but she couldn’t participate in the game due to the entry requirements.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Seong Jihan looked at her as if questioning what she just said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You have to come too. What are you talking about?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh… I can participate as an Archer? Isn’t that against fairness?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can pick 20 people as I please. Besides, your survival ability is top-notch.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, really? Are you really picking me?! But my level is too low, is that okay?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s okay. I’ll bring a few more people besides you. Even if they’re low level.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After playing Rehearsal these days, Seong Jihan became certain.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to train some useful players.’
 </p>
 <p>
  At this moment, Seong Jihan could carry the game by himself, but when they entered the main game of the Space League, he wouldn’t be able to finish everything alone.
 </p>
 <p>
  He needed SSS-ranked Gifted players from around the world to grow somehow and help him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really? Well, it’s good for me, but… I’m sorry because my level is too low.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Weren’t you fine with getting cursed?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Getting called a cheater is praise, but this feels a bit like nepotism, heh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then let’s level up a bit more.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can’t play games until the 30th, you know?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, we can do a special map together.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Special map?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recalled a map that he had obtained from the Brahma.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The special dungeon map, ‘Divine constellation – Brahma’, is unlocked for Player Seong Jihan.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The special dungeon can only be entered by the permitted player Seong Jihan and his party members.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The special dungeon can be entered once per week.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The special dungeon is not included in the 1 game per day limit.]
 </p>
 <p>
  I can raise my niece’s level some more here.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘And I have to hear Brahma’s answer too.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Brahma, who didn’t want to answer why he wanted Crimson Thunder back then, Seong Jihan decided to ask him after a month.

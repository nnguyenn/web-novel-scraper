  Chapter 177
 </h3>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chapter 177
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Special Dungeon Map, ‘Divine Constellation – Brahma.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The participating players include Yoon Seah, Sophia, and…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can I really join too?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course.”
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, it was Masied who participated in the Promotion Match.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m getting more and more indebted to the owner… I’ll dedicate my bones to Daegi guild. As long as I’m not kicked out that is.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who’d kick out an SSS-rank Mage?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Masied, possessing the Gift ‘God of Soccer’.
 </p>
 <p>
  He now had a completely different, neat appearance compared to before.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike during his Bronze and Silver days, he was now confidently recognized as one of the world’s most promising talents.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was also gaining popularity on BattleTube with his unique soccer ball concept.
 </p>
 <p>
  While his home country Argentina was now trying to bring him back by any means,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He doesn’t want to go himself.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan inadvertently felt apologetic towards Argentina.
 </p>
 <p>
  If things went as usual, the wandering Masied would’ve had his enlightenment in his hometown after a few more years of wandering, but
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps because Seong Jihan had told him about the Arachne Orb this time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even when administrators from Argentina came to persuade him to return.
 </p>
 <p>
  -I can’t go back. I have to repay Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Masied’s attitude was resolute.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t you miss your family? You said you’d reunite after becoming successful.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s why I’m trying to bring them to Korea.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… Is that so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Masied’s whole family, including his wife and children, were residing in Argentina. Even though Seong Jihan thought he would go back to see them, Masied seemed to be planning to bring his family to Korea instead.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He’d gain citizenship immediately if I told him to.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If even Masied gained Korean citizenship, they’d have the strongest lineup except for Supporters.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though it would be a complete dream team.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No, even if Masied isn’t here, we’ll be number one anyway.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Adding Yoon Seah, who is growing rapidly, to the lineup of Seong Jihan and the Sword King in the upcoming season, Korea would be number one anyway.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this situation, there was no need to forcibly bring in foreign talents and cause innocent victims in Argentina due to his own actions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mr. Masied, sorry about the promotion match.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s there to be sorry about?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I shot you a few arrows while hiding. It was a bit fatal, wasn’t it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  During the promotion match, Barren, Wang Lin, and Masied were engaged in a fierce battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, who appeared from the veil of void, shot arrows annoyingly and eventually Masied fell for that tactic, finishing second in the promotion match.
 </p>
 <p>
  So her BattleTube was bombarded by American, Chinese, and Argentinian netizens.
 </p>
 <p>
  But Masied himself didn’t look bothered at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nothing nasty about BattleNet. It’s just efficient combat.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehehe, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah’s BattleTube received terrorism from three countries: America, China, and Argentina.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the party with Seong Jihan, including Masied, faced a hurdle as soon as they entered the map.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is there nothing here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Except for Seong Jihan, the three came here to level up. But there were no monsters to defeat.
 </p>
 <p>
  The only thing there was
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, that’s the thing from Uncle’s broadcast.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The path illuminated the dim floor, reminiscent of the Thunder Path from the Divine Constellation’s Throne map. During the promotion match on that map, the endless Thunder Path was a challenge. When they failed to reach the Divine Throne , the remaining 7 survivors fell into the temple, and the game ended after the chaotic rampage of the Constellation of the Dead Star.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that the Throne of the Divine Constellation? It’s magnificent.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite looking reachable with Thunder Steps from afar,
 </p>
 <p>
  He failed to close the distance until the game’s end.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do we have to walk that path?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It won’t be easy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  While the other party members, excluding Seong Jihan, were contemplating how to break through the Thunder Path,
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzz…
 </p>
 <p>
  The floor’s current flashed intensely.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’ve arrived faster than expected.]
 </p>
 <p>
  From the current, a dignified voice flowed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps for reaching the Throne of the Divine Constellation, instead of sending a system message, Brahma directly conveyed his message.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Who are these three beggars?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, we just came to level up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ha, how ridiculous. Leveling up at the Throne of the Divine Constellation…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a special dungeon. Is that not allowed?”
 </p>
 <p>
  […….]
 </p>
 <p>
  In response to Seong Jihan’s words, the current crackled.
 </p>
 <p>
  Something slowly rose from the Thunder Path.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Get rid of these beggars. You come quickly. Turn off BattleTube before you come.]
 </p>
 <p>
  What Brahma summoned was a massive humanoid form made of the Thunder.
 </p>
 <p>
  In appearance, it was plain, with only the currents sparking.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  “What is this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s the remnant of the vanished Thunder God.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “The vanished Thunder God?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’ve seen it right in front of your eyes.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, Zeus.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Listening and watching, it did resemble Zeus in size, but only in body size.
 </p>
 <p>
  In terms of lightning power, it looked much weaker than the original god.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, it might be challenging for the three who had just become Platinum.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is there something weaker?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s the weakest.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Should they fight it together?
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan was contemplating for a moment, Yoon Seah spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle, you go first. We’ll try to take it down ourselves.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right. We can’t rely on care forever. Let’s challenge it ourselves.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, Jihan. Just give us the Phoenix Flag buff.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded as he looked at the three who were ready to fight.
 </p>
 <p>
  Right, I can’t keep spoon feeding them forever.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan planted the Phoenix Flag to give the buff then
 </p>
 <p>
  Used Thunder Steps to follow the Thunder path.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Since he personally invited me this time, following the path should lead me to the throne.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a completely different situation from the promotion match. Seong Jihan’s thought was reasonable.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, after running for 30 minutes like that,
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What the heck?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Thunder Path seemed endless, and the end was not in sight, unlike last time.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  “The path is same?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan asked, thinking Brahma was listening, but
 </p>
 <p>
  […….]
 </p>
 <p>
  No response came from him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hey, why’s he being like this when he was urging me to come quickly earlier?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is he telling me to figure it out on my own?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan stopped using the skill and pondered. Continuing to run like this was a pointless situation. He needed to find a way to reach the Divine Throne somehow.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Should I go towards that darkness?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Next to the Thunder path, there was a dim space. As Seong Jihan approached, it repelled him like a solid wall. An impassable darkness.
 </p>
 <p>
  But Seong Jihan, realizing that following the Thunder path wouldn’t lead to a solution, took out his spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nameless divine art, Fusion of Divine thunder and phoenix – Crimson Thunder cannon
 </p>
 <p>
  Zi-zi-zik…!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the crimson lightning pierced through, the darkness began to crumble bit by bit. However, as soon as one hole appeared, the darkness wall instantly restored its original form.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Geu-eu-eu……
 </p>
 <p>
  Occasionally, eerie sounds that sent shivers down the spine echoed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm…’
 </p>
 <p>
  If following the Thunder path wasn’t the answer, he had to find a way through this wall. Thinking so, Seong Jihan took out his spear and walked along the wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  After about fifteen minutes of walking,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This place is a bit different.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike just before, he could find a slightly indented wall. And this place,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Especially strong currents in the Thunder path.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It also emitted a powerful aura from the Thunder path.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan fired another Crimson Thunder Cannon towards this place.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Geu-eu-eu……
 </p>
 <p>
  A massive groaning sound echoed, and the sky and the ground shook.
 </p>
 <p>
  And when the vibration stopped,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Oh, the distance to the throne…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The distance to the throne had shrunk a bit.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hitting the wall where the electricity is strong narrowed the distance.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Having found the method, Seong Jihan continued searching for dented areas of the wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rumble…!
 </p>
 <p>
  And so, after the earth shook over ten times,
 </p>
 <p>
  It gradually narrowed the distance to the throne.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But it’s still not the end.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The narrowing distance was still too short. At this rate, it would take a hundred or even a thousand times to completely close the gap.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can’t keep wasting time here.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead of the pathbreaking method, Seong Jihan sought a new approach.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The things making up this wall, they seem like resentful spirits…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The wailing sounds when striking the wall were like vengeful spirits’ shrieks.
 </p>
 <p>
  And if these were really spirits.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had the optimal martial art for that, Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Inventory.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He took out two swords from his inventory.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  S-rank swords bought to use Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods.
 </p>
 <p>
  He crossed the two swords and Eclipse before stabbing them into the wall of darkness.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nameless Divine Arts, Annihilation God’s Secret – Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  A small pattern was drawn on the wall of darkness.
 </p>
 <p>
  The pattern of Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods, slightly bigger than when confining Shizuru’s soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  But compared to the giant wall of darkness, it was only the size of a fingernail.
 </p>
 <p>
  To anyone looking, it seemed like a pattern that could be swallowed by darkness.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack!
 </p>
 <p>
  Even the two S-rank swords stabbed for Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods broke.
 </p>
 <p>
  This attempt at the martial art seemed to have failed.
 </p>
 <p>
  But as the pattern of Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods slowly spun,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It seems more complete than last time.’ ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m
 </p>
 <p>
  A smile appeared on Seong Jihan’s face.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Geu-eu-eu……
 </p>
 <p>
  -Liberation… is it…
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather than the darkness devouring, it was the pattern of Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods.
 </p>
 <p>
  The massive wall of darkness was sucked into Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods instantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike when using the Crimson Thunder Cannon where it quickly regenerated,
 </p>
 <p>
  The collapsed wall remained collapsed this time.
 </p>
 <p>
  And
 </p>
 <p>
  Rumble…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The distance to the throne shrank tremendously, incomparable to earlier.
 </p>
 <p>
  [As expected…….]
 </p>
 <p>
  And
 </p>
 <p>
  Brahma, who had been silent since walking the path of the Thunder Waves, opened his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Truly a fearsome sealing formation. To be able to destroy part of the spirit wall with that level of power. If your strength was greater, perhaps all the spirits could’ve been sucked in.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you have any information about this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Rumors…… I’ve heard The Constellation that hunts Constellations, The ‘Wandering Martial God’, has an absolute sealing formation that can even bind souls. Isn’t that what you just used?]
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no Constellation who didn’t know about the Wandering Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan slowly nodded,
 </p>
 <p>
  [I’ll definitely need The Crimson Thunder ….]
 </p>
 <p>
  A golden portal opened in front of the Thunder path.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Come. Any more tests are meaningless now.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ***
 </p>
 <p>
  Entering the portal Brahma personally opened,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan could finally get close to the Divine Constellation’s Throne he saw from afar.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That’s Brahma…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Brahma, fitting of the massive Constellation, was so huge that Seong Jihan was only the size of his toenail in comparison.
 </p>
 <p>
  But what grabbed his gaze wasn’t Brahma’s enormous size,
 </p>
 <p>
  But his body’s composition itself.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘All sorts of things gathered…’
 </p>
 <p>
  On Brahma’s body made of electricity, all kinds of faces were congregated.
 </p>
 <p>
  From humanoid appearances to all sorts of beast faces.
 </p>
 <p>
  Tens of thousands of faces were gazing at Seong Jihan together.
 </p>
 <p>
  The chimeras from before were purity itself compared to this.
 </p>
 <p>
  The body of the Brahma was chaos itself.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why’s there so many?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I am the composite of Thunder Gods. Some of your planet’s gods are included among the 77,000 Thunder Gods.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Like Zeus?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes… Zeus, who was absorbed recently, was also part of me.]
 </p>
 <p>
  All gods bearing the concept of ‘Thunder God’ gathered together.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No wonder he’s so powerful.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Brahma, possessing an intense presence beyond any other existence he had seen so far.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan could instantly grasp why he received special treatment among the Constellations the moment he saw him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even one Zeus was formidable, let alone 77,000 combined.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan gazed at Brahma then brought up the main topic.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, why do you need the Crimson Thunder?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s…….]
 </p>
 <p>
  Tzitzizi…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Electricity erupted around Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lightning blocking the gazes of the 77,000 Thunder gods.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then amidst the wall of electricity, the face of a lion suddenly popped out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan instinctively knew this was his conversation partner until now.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He’s the leader among the 77,000 Thunder Gods.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The blue lightning’s lion, seemingly the most powerful among the countless Thunder Gods.
 </p>
 <p>
  Didn’t know why he had to make a wall to talk when he could just speak openly, but
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan waited for his response.
 </p>
 <p>
  And
 </p>
 <p>
  [To escape from here, to live.]
 </p>
 <p>
  From the majestic lion, he heard an unexpected answer.

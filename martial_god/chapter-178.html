  Chapter 178
 </h3>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  Chapter 178
 </p>
 <p>
  “Escape? Why?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s because of the Wandering Martial God I mentioned earlier.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The blue lion in the electric wall frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  [He’s targeting me, us.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Martial God?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Externally, Seong Jihan reacted as if surprised, but
 </p>
 <p>
  He had predicted the Wandering Martial God would target Brahma someday.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Among the three divine arts that appeared in the future, The Divine Thunder Decree resembled Brahma’s powers.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Divine Decree of Heavenly Thunder that encompassed all lightning martial arts.
 </p>
 <p>
  That was originally based on the powers held by Brahma.
 </p>
 <p>
  This must be around the time the Martial God subjugated Brahma and created The Divine Decree of the Nameless Arts
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s right. The constellation that has never been defeated once. The monster that grows stronger by devouring other constellations. He’s flying here towards the Constellation’s with his own star in tow… Saying he’ll destroy the Divine Constellation’s Throne to examine something inside.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the electric-walled Divine Constellation’s Throne and wondered.
 </p>
 <p>
  What was there to examine inside that massive chair?
 </p>
 <p>
  But from his words, the Martial God’s goal seemed to be the throne itself rather than Brahma.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If his target is the throne, can’t you just flee if you know you can’t win?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Although I’m Brahma’s representative, I can’t completely go against the will of the 77,000 Thunder gods. And, every Thunder god was one of the most powerful gods in their own worlds. To them, avoiding a challenger is unimaginable.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Many Thunder gods had reigned as god-kings in various mythologies.
 </p>
 <p>
  To them, a challenger was something to naturally be trampled and driven off.
 </p>
 <p>
  Abandoning the throne and fleeing from the enemy went against the Thunder god’s pride.
 </p>
 <p>
  So most of the Thunder gods readily decided to face the Wandering Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re a Thunder god too, how did you think to flee then?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I have seen…… the Martial God’s power from beyond the universe.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Brahma’s voice, though dignified, slightly shook when talking about the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  [That pattern you used earlier, sucking in souls… Even at a tiny grain size, it considerably destroyed the spirit wall…]
 </p>
 <p>
  He’s talking about Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods?
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan nodded, the blue lion shook his head furiously.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Wandering Martial God used that on an entire planet.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That pattern completely covered a planet…! No one could escape from there. Even the planet’s owner’s throne was no exception.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Martial God is that powerful…’ He expected The Martial God would be strong.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s why he had the reputation of a constellation-hunting Constellation.
 </p>
 <p>
  But to blanket Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods over an entire planet?
 </p>
 <p>
  Having personally used it himself, Seong Jihan knew how preposterous that was.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Even using it as a skill in my past life, a few meters was the limit…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, he could expand the range much further now with Spirit Embodiment.
 </p>
 <p>
  But still, to blanket Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods over a whole planet?
 </p>
 <p>
  It was unthinkable no matter how he thought about it.
 </p>
 <p>
  [That being… is an unstoppable, disastrous existence. I persuaded the other Brahmas as hard as I could, but they wouldn’t listen. Rather, they threatened to pull me from my position of representative if I kept saying such things.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “So you want to escape.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s right. I can’t just wait here to die…! For now, my body is bound as a part of Brahma. I need to transform into a new ‘concept’ to separate from here.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “A new concept…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The crimson electricity you used… I saw hope in that. It bears the attribute of thunder, yet is clearly distinguished power. Usually impossible to mix, two powers fused, so it’s a power not bound by Brahma’s concept. I desperately need that.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Crimson Thunder Cannon was that amazing?
 </p>
 <p>
  It was just mixing the Phoenix’s fire powers and the Divine thunder…
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan couldn’t understand why the Brahma leader was overvaluing his Crimson Thunder Cannon so much, but
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, no harm in accepting if he’s willing to pay a lot.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He was determined to squeeze out as much compensation as possible from this blue lion bearing his abdomen.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then I’ll do everything reasonable.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes! What do you need? Just say it! I’m Brahma’s representative. I can give you anything you desire!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Brahma says he can do anything, but
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can you remove BattleNet from Earth then? I want it to return to how the past world was.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Removing BattleNet… That’s impossible. Even the Martial God couldn’t do that.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s impossible huh. Then can you strengthen my abilities? I have this thing called Spirit Embodiment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s impossible too. Strengthening a star’s abilities… How could I do that?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then what can you do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing Brahma’s unsatisfactory gaze, he indignantly justified himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  [In the first place, aren’t you demanding preposterous things…! Infinite GP, SSS-rank skills, SSS-rank Gifts…! Don’t you need things like that?\
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  “Hmm… SSS doesn’t do much, EX-rank would be nice.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Right now, completing the Nameless Divine Arts was more important.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having one or two more SSS-ranks added wouldn’t make him feel much stronger.
 </p>
 <p>
  EX-rank, a step above SSS, would make him feel like he gained something.
 </p>
 <p>
  [EX-rank…….]
 </p>
 <p>
  And hearing Seong Jihan’s words, Brahma fell deep in thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  [That might be possible…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. But I can’t give it immediately. Even gods need preparation for EX-rank, so….]
 </p>
 <p>
  Brahma then offered a contract.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Thunder God’s Leader is requesting a contract.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Thunder God’s Leader will provide player ‘Seong Jihan’ with an EX-rank Gift or skill.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [In return, Player Seong Jihan will teach the concept of the ‘Completed Crimson Thunder’ to the Thunder God’s Leader.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do you accept this contract?]
 </p>
 <p>
  * Note – This is a contract with a god. Strong divine punishment will follow if promises are broken.
 </p>
 <p>
  A contract where Thunder God’s Leader provides the EX-rank first, then Seong Jihan teaches the concept later.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Getting an EX-rank is a sweet deal.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan formed a contract with Thunder God’s Leader.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Good… I will notify you when preparations are complete. So hurry and perfect that Crimson Thunder cannon.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Relieved after forming the contract, Thunder God’s Leader heaved a sigh.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll try my best. Time is tight.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s right…We don’t know when the Wandering Martial God will strike. Oh right. I will prepare a training area here for you. Time will flow slower in the training room within the special dungeon.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps since they were in a hurry,
 </p>
 <p>
  Brahma provided all kinds of conveniences for Seong Jihan to complete the Crimson Thunder cannon, aside from the promised reward.
 </p>
 <p>
  He even considered his party members.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ah, and those specks of dust you brought… didn’t they say they needed to level up? I’ll keep summoning Zeus’s Husk. Seems like your team got wiped out this time, so come a bit more prepared next time.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, they got wiped out?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Even a god’s husk was too much for those who just became Platinum, huh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Send me to the training area then. I’ll start right away.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Good mindset. Wait a moment.]
 </p>
 <p>
  After waiting about 10 minutes,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  A blue portal was created before Seong Jihan’s eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  [10 days inside here equals 1 day in reality.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Being able to train 10 days for every 1 day.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s eyes shined as he asked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a shame we can only enter the special dungeon once a week. Can’t we come more for the training room?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s in BattleNet’s domain so it’s impossible. This is already pushing it.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seemed all-powerful at first glance, but quite a few things he can’t do huh.
 </p>
 <p>
  With that thought, Seong Jihan stepped into the portal.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  The next day.
 </p>
 <p>
  Returning home, Seong Jihan asked Yoon Seah in the living room.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah-ya, how long has it been since I entered?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “One day?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Brahma’s training room, splendid effects.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought the training room might be the most cost-efficient gain from the special dungeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Could you match up against Zeus’s husk?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh…. it was tough. Fortunately it’s a special dungeon so I didn’t delevel after dying but…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah shook her head with a tired expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Felt like I was properly educated after always attacking under the Veil.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Brahma said he’d summon it again. Wanna challenge it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh really? I’m so down! Gotta get revenge!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Wanting another challenge upon hearing it was possible again, her competitive spirit seemed to have awakened after dying for the first time in a while.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But I didn’t level up this time, so participating in the Chaos Battlefield might be….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, it’s fine. Picking the 20 is completely my right. Your spot is reserved.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, who had just advanced to Platinum.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Compared to other Platinums nearing Level 200, her level was far too low.
 </p>
 <p>
  Picking her would surely draw backlash, but
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I have to pick her even if it was someone else with those results.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The current talent pool of Earth’s Platinum players was ambiguous compared to Diamond and below.
 </p>
 <p>
  Those gifted with SSS-ranks had already ascended to Diamond.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even SS-ranks were hard to find.
 </p>
 <p>
  The talent pool was in quite a poor state compared to Diamond and Gold.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The 20 I have the right to select will be promising talents to become pillars of the future.’
 </p>
 <p>
  And Yoon Seah perfectly met that criteria.
 </p>
 <p>
  “First, I’ll include you, Masied, and Sophia, and give opportunities to other promising talents too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, really? Who?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “People you know well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan went down to the guild and relayed the people he had in mind to Lee Hayeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  Receiving the list from him, Lee Hayeon’s eyes widened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re selecting from these people…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s list totaled 30 people.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some belonged to the Daegi guild, some didn’t.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking over the list carefully, Lee Hayeon spoke up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “May I contact the guild members first? I think there should still be some guild benefits.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Go ahead.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes! I will contact them right away!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon contacted the Daegi guild members first.
 </p>
 <p>
  And this matter swiftly spread big rumors in the industry.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  “That damn bitch… Hiding like a turtle…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren, who lost to Yoon Seah in the previous promotion match, completely sank into despair after losing to both uncle and niece and drowned himself in alcohol.
 </p>
 <p>
  “SHIT!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Crash!
 </p>
 <p>
  Continuously rewatching promotion match videos and seeing Yoon Seah hiding in the veil,
 </p>
 <p>
  He smashed the liquor bottles.
 </p>
 <p>
  Buzz buzz..
 </p>
 <p>
  His face was hazy when he received a call on his vibrating phone.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Barren-nim. The Daegi guild contacted me.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Whaddya want? Hehe… Are they kicking me out? To restrain me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [No. Seong Jihan-nim is asking if you want to participate in the Chaos Battlefield.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What…? Me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren was flabbergasted, his eyes shooting wide open.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Chaos Battlefield..
 </p>
 <p>
  He badly wanted to participate, craving those 7 stat points, but didn’t even dream of it due to his recent trouble with Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really…? It’s not him messing with me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [He says if you show no interest, he’ll move on to the next person. Do you not want to do it?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do, I wanna do it! I’ll do it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  7 stat points.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om
 </p>
 <p>
  No players’ eyes wouldn’t spin at that.
 </p>
 <p>
  And
 </p>
 <p>
  “What… Barren got contacted too? That Barren who was cursing at Seong Jihan-nim?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, Barren has already posted on StarBook, ‘Seong Jihan, acknowledge me just this once’….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm, to think he got contacted….”
 </p>
 <p>
  China’s Heavenly Demon,
 </p>
 <p>
  Wang Lin clicked his tongue upon hearing Barren would participate in the Chaos Battlefield
 </p>
 <p>
  “How about… me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They say they’re primarily contacting Daegi guild members… But….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, right….”
 </p>
 <p>
  Wang Lin, who left his guild after the match between Korea and China.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was on better terms with Seong Jihan than Barren, but not being a Daegi guild member,
 </p>
 <p>
  He didn’t receive contact this time.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can’t you… do something about it? Like rejoining or….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll… relay it to my superiors.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s 7 stats, 7. This is a really important issue!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I knew it was a bad sign when I left the guild that time……!
 </p>
 <p>
  Wang Lin grew very impatient.

  Chapter 179
 </h3>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  Chapter 179
 </p>
 <p>
  “Miss, there’s a guest from the People’s Guild.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Again?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon furrowed her eyebrows.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since the decision to select the 20 players who would stand on the chaotic battlefield was made within the major guilds in China, people from the People’s Guild had been continuously visiting.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Guild Master, nice to see you again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A middle-aged man with a greasy face entered the guild master’s office with a slick smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  Zhang Shuzhong.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan obtained the Phoenix Flag, he was one of the top officials of the People’s Guild who competed in sponsorship with Robert Gates.
 </p>
 <p>
  Originally, he wasn’t supposed to come all the way to Korea himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You still look beautiful today…! You’re even more beautiful in person than in videos.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Saying he was supposedly her fan, he came in person rather than sending an underling.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a shame that you’re dating Mr. Seong Jihan. Really disappointing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  While saying that, Zhang Shuzhong glanced at Lee Hayeon with a greedy gaze.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon’s expression turned cold at the sight of the covetous gaze.
 </p>
 <p>
  An annoying guy pretending to be a fan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s get to the point.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Haha, it’s the same as I mentioned yesterday. I want to bring in five players, including Wang Lin, back into the Daegi guild.”
 </p>
 <p>
  They leave whenever they want, then try to naturally slither back in once the situation changes due to the Chaos Battlefield.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon shook her head left and right.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll have to give you the same answer as yesterday. I’m sorry, but there’s no vacancy. Please apply when there’s an opening next time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Spots can be made if needed, no? Just make other country’s players leave.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s contractually impossible.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you release the lease contracts with other players, we’ll cover all the penalties. We’ll also pay double the usual lease fee. Consider it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  So the People’s Guild is that financially affluent.
 </p>
 <p>
  Zhang tried to sway her with money, but Lee Hayeon flatly refused.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you for the offer, but I have to consider relationships with other guilds as well. It would be difficult to accept.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… You should also consider the relationship with our guild. Wouldn’t it be nice for neighbors to get along well?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Weren’t you the one who left first?”
 </p>
 <p>
  No apology whatsoever, just arrogantly demanding they make room as if money could solve everything.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon found the People’s Guild’s attitude preposterous.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Neighbors can have minor quarrels for a bit. But since we’ll keep seeing each other, ultimately being on good terms benefits both sides, no? I heard players rented from Italian and Australian guilds signed early, so their rental fees are cheap. Terminate contracts with them and sign with us instead.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even specifying which rental player’s contracts to terminate.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon sighed and looked at Lim Gayeong.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m afraid that offer is unacceptable. Gayeong, please escort him out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This way, please.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehe… What a waste. It’s a chance for mutual gain. How regrettable, how unfortunate. I will visit again tomorrow.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Zhang Shuzhong left the Guild Master’s Office still smiling slyly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not long after, Lim Gayeong came back inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Was there any trouble?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He asked if I have a boyfriend. He said he has three hotels in downtown Seoul and asked if I wanted to stay with him. Nonsense like that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh, that crazy guy. I don’t know why he speaks Korean so well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “His ex-wife was Korean.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He had four kids with her?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, he had one child with her.”
 </p>
 <p>
  How many wives did he have then? Lee Hayeon said with frustration, “I don’t want to meet that guy again tomorrow… Shall we go on a business trip?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I strongly agree.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s finalize the list of 20 members and then go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was selecting 20 members to take to the chaotic battlefield. Originally, the list included Wang Lin’s name. Regardless of nationality, he selected players with the highest growth potential. Besides Wang Lin, there were a few more players selected by Seong Jihan who were not from the Daegi guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should have just chosen according to the list given at that time…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon regretted suggesting prioritizing guild members to give them merit. However, regret started to creep in when Zhang Shuzhong visited the guild again.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No, even so, he came this far… I should stick to choosing guild members until the end!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Encouraged by the interest from the People’s Guild, Lee Hayeon confirmed the list of guild members that day. Due to the limit on Daegi guild members, the list ended with 10 Platinum-level talents.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Boss, the guild member list is confirmed!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, I’ll come to see it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded as he looked at the confirmed list provided by Lee Hayeon.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  “Is this our guild member list?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, please select the remaining 10 from the list you provided. Shouldn’t it be easy to choose by deducing from that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The list included 10 individuals with talents ranging from SSS to SS gifts. It seemed colorful, probably because promising individuals from all over the world were sent to the Daegi guild. Now, with 10 more members to select from the remaining talents, they had to consider wisely.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Should I choose based on gifts?” Seong Jihan took out a pen and started circling names. Hearing this, Lee Hayeon cautiously spoke up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Boss… Are you planning to choose Wang Lin?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, I thought of choosing based on gifts. It’s better to take talent with us.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, I see…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is there a problem?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, no. Boss, can I take a few days off then?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Vacation?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, not going far, just resting at my house in Sword Palace.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon, who hadn’t taken a break while coming to the guild every day, asking for a vacation was surprising. Seeing Seong Jihan’s curious eyes, Lim Gayeong supplemented the explanation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Lately, a persistent middle-aged man kept assigning tasks to her. She seems to need some rest.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Middle-aged man? Who is that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The People’s Guild’s Zhang Shuzhong.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “People came from the People’s Guild?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, he’s asking to join the guild again, saying they want their people back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After arrogantly leaving when they demanded he divulge the origins of his martial arts, now they’re asking to rejoin the guild to participate in the Chaos Battlefield?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did they even apologize to me or the guild side?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Apologize? What apology? They just confidently told me to kick out other guild members and make space for them, offering more money. It seems like they believe money can solve everything.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking everything can be solved with money without the slightest apology.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That won’t do.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He was just going to pick by ability but if they’re gonna act like that, he has no choice.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan originally intended to select based on abilities, but if they insist, there’s no choice.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t accept even if they offer 10 times more money.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “And when that man comes, just kick him out. Don’t bother dealing with him individually. Hayeon is the superior, and they are just subordinates.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, from now on, I’ll do just that!”
 </p>
 <p>
  After Seong Jihan regulated them like so, Lee Hayeon’s eyes lit up.
 </p>
 <p>
  As expected, he didn’t care one bit about them being China’s top guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  She had to follow that stance.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, then I guess I don’t need a vacation!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You should take a vacation. People need to rest a bit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, I want to kick him out myself. Hehe….”
 </p>
 <p>
  Having endured a lot of stress from Zhang Shuzhong, Lee Hayeon smiled. And the next day,
 </p>
 <p>
  “G-Guild Master! What is the meaning of this? Chasing away the representative of the People’s Guild who came…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The list has been announced. Don’t come again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “H-How dare a mere Korean guild disregard the People’s Guild’s offer like this?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, we’re disregarding it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aside from Lee Gayeong, Lee Hayeon also brought several bodyguards.
 </p>
 <p>
  She promptly ordered Zhang Shuzhong to be removed from the premises.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Especially from someone like you, Zhang Shuzhong, I have no thoughts of negotiating. How many times do you have to ogle someone? You even sexually harassed Gayeong.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Cough…! When did I ever do that…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  He coughed awkwardly, looking around at the mention of sexual harassment.
 </p>
 <p>
  The burly bodyguards were all glaring at him.
 </p>
 <p>
  They didn’t look inclined to negotiate at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…You will regret this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Unable to do anything, he could only spit out that one line before leaving the Daegi guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Phew, that middle-aged man finally left.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He said we’ll regret it. What do you think he’ll try?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t know, let him try whatever.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Returning to the Guild Master’s Office, Lee Hayeon smiled refreshingly as she swiftly scrolled her mouse wheel.
 </p>
 <p>
  “As the Boss said, we’re the boss here, right?”
 </p>
 <p>

 <p>
  [The Chaos Battlefield participation list finalized!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Were they selected by Gift rank? The 20 chosen by Seong Jihan are all outstanding talents.]

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  [Barren, who had trouble with Seong Jihan, is also included, earning praise for the fair list.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Why was SSS-grade Wang Lin excluded? Chinese netizens vigorously protest against Seong Jihan!]
 </p>
 <p>
  -These guys, who the hell do they think they are to come crawling back in?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Right, remember how they tried all kinds of dirty tricks to see if Seong Jihan favored martial arts principles or results?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -And the Chinese guys, they were spewing foam at the mouth with Japan saying Seong Jihan’s national qualifications should be revoked.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Then they dare to say ‘Pick me’ now…
 </p>
 <p>
  The list for the Chaos Battlefield has been announced. While the World BattleNet Association mainly recruited warriors and supporters with levels close to 200, the 20 players selected by Seong Jihan were all promising talents that any BattleNet fan would recognize. In addition to those from the Daegi guild, players were chosen based on gift grades, promising to become pillars of the future.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking at the list alone, it seemed fair, selecting purely based on abilities. However, there was one exception. The exclusion of Wang Lin, one of the top promising talents, stirred controversy.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Seong Jihan should not do this for the sake of humanity. Everyone should be given a fair chance!
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is he trying to restrict Wang Lin’s talent already? As expected, his worldview is narrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Replacing Wang Lin with a SS-rank Gift makes no sense!
 </p>
 <p>
  -Seong Jihan, quickly apologize and revise the list!
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially Chinese netizens, following Seong Jihan and the standby guild’s BattleTube, even invaded Yoon Seah’s BattleTube to leave all kinds of malicious comments.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ugh, why are shameless Chinese like this?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Would you pick them if you were in his shoes?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -And Seong Jihan gets to decide the list, who’re you to tell him this and that?
 </p>
 <p>
  Korean users countered these comments, creating a battlefield in the virtual world. Seong Jihan sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s starting again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After skimming through the protest comments, he simply turned off his attention. Now that the team was fully formed, he only focused on clearing the Chaos Battlefield.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, in the People’s Guild meeting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No…Why didn’t it work…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Wang Lin entered the conference room with a disappointed expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then Zhang Shuzhong, who led the negotiations, coughed and justified his failure.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Cough! Those bastards were unbelievably brazen. They outright kicked me, the People’s Guild’s representative out!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “To think a mere Korean guild would…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Utterly arrogant.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Believing Zhang Shuzhong and denouncing the Daegi guild,
 </p>
 <p>
  The People’s Guild started using connections to somehow secure a spot for top Chinese talent Wang Lin.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can’t you include Wang Lin’s spot by replacing one of the players selected by the World BattleNet Association?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They set clear level restrictions so that’s impossible. It might work if Wang Lin was Level 180 or higher but….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh, the Chaos Battlefield will have ended by then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Having just been promoted, there’s no way Wang Lin could reach level 180.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hearing this, Zhang Shuzhong spoke meaningfully.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How many of our players have been selected so far?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “About 60.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then… let’s make it deliberately difficult for them…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you mean…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Until Wang Lin is selected, intentionally make it tough for them.”Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  Those guys from the Daegi guild said they would make them regret, right? Zhang Shuzhong proposed such a risky gamble.
 </p>
 <p>
  “With 60 players, we can easily ruin the game progress. Use them for deliberate difficulties until they ask for Wang Lin.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t that too much of a risk?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, if this gets exposed, we’ll face worldwide criticism.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then will you just take this lying down? We need to show them their place.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps being driven out by Lee Hayeon was so humiliating that Zhang strongly advocated for deliberate difficulties. Wang Lin, listening to this, grimaced.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This might not work…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Given Seong Jihan’s personality, there’s no way he’d let this slide…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well… let’s give it a try.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. We can’t just let them off like this!”
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the People’s Guild, already of a firm nature, decided to pursue an absurd plan, believing that their representative had suffered disgrace at the hands of the Daegi guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  Wang Lin watched with an uneasy expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is going to be a disaster…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet the only thing he could do was only observe.

   Chapter 18
  </strong>

 </p>
 <p>
  2 days later, in the training room…
 </p>
 <p>
  [Failed the Three Dantian integration.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Attempt to integrate Three Dantian integration failed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I lack both, the power and experience.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The integration of the Three Dantian was not achieved through willpower alone. Even though I have Martial power, it is still insufficient.
 </p>
 <p>
  The experience from the previous life was abundant only in the Bottom dantian, the source of power, but it was lacking for the Middle and Top dantians.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan had a bright expression despite the failure.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was because he had gained something through this.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Divine Power and Magic Power have been integrated and replaced by the unique stat ‘Force’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Achievement unlocked: ‘Acquisition of Unique Stat.’]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’ve Earned 10,000 achievement points.]
 </p>
 <p>
  He had acquired his initial goal, the Unique Stat ‘Force.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [The connection link of the Three Dantians is maintained faintly.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The stats ‘Martial Power’ and ‘Force’ interact, sharing stats points.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The relatively low value of Force stat had risen to match Martial Power.
 </p>
 <p>
  Name: Seong Jihan
 </p>
 <p>
  Level: 10
 </p>
 <p>
  Affiliation: Bronze League – Gangnam 1 Area
 </p>
 <p>
  Martial Power: 12
 </p>
 <p>
  Force: 12
 </p>
 <p>
  Class: Support
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  Class: Mage
 </p>
 <p>
  Gift: Wanderer’s Insight (Rank F)
 </p>
 <p>
  Title: Tutorial Conqueror – Bronze
 </p>
 <p>
  Achievement Points: 51,200
 </p>
 <p>
  Remaining Stats points: 2
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should allocate some points.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan cautiously increased Martial Power by 2 and as his Martial Power changed to 14, Force also rose to 14 accordingly.
 </p>
 <p>
  He clenched his fist involuntarily.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This… is as if I gained the effects of Baron’s Gift, ‘Two Status Windows’.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He could solve most things through the Achievement Shop, but obtaining two stat points at once was out of the question.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the connection link of the Three Dantians maintained and Martial Power and Force linked, he was now able to receive 2 remaining points just like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he used one stat point, two stats would increase.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is a very good result.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, the best result would have been the successful integration of the Three Dantians. But based on his experience of attempting integration over the past two days, Seong Jihan knew that was an impossible task at the moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘My proficiency in the Top and Middle Dantians is too low. I need to increase the understanding of both Dantians while using Force.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Above all, he needed to increase his stats.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They should be 100 at least.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Both Strength and Force needed to be at 100 for the attempt at Three Dantian integration to be possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I have a goal now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With a smile on his lips, Seong Jihan finished his three days of secluded training and left the training room.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle! Are you done with training? Are you feeling okay?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, who had been waiting outside the training room, rushed over.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since he hadn’t come out for three days, she was wondering if something was wrong and was debating whether to go in or not. Just as she was thinking that, Seong Jihan came out.
 </p>
 <p>
  “As you can see, I’m doing great.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Looks like it. You seem to be in good condition.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I achieved something.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aren’t you feeling sleepy or anything?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nah, I’m fine. Why?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, who was observing Seong Jihan’s complexion, spoke cautiously.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well… you know that Manager Park Yoonsik who visited our house before, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  He had asked for the donation of the Sword Palace and relayed the government’s stance, asking to stay in the penthouse a bit longer.
 </p>
 <p>
  After requesting an auction for the items left by the Sword King, he had sent them back.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why? Did he mention anything about the auction?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. He said the higher-ups had accepted and asked if we could host the auction tomorrow, and I said yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Tomorrow? That’s tight on time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, he came the day before yesterday. From that perspective, it’s three days away.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I see. You did well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “And I looked through the items a bit…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan skimmed through the list of items to be auctioned and nodded his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  The items Yoon Seah had chosen weren’t the Sword King’s personal belongings.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were storage devices containing his Battle Net Connector and data, as well as analysis data of both himself and opponents—essentially, all data related to Battle Net play.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Putting items like the Sword King’s personal belongings in an auction like this could have a negative effect.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The reason for hosting the auction was to get as much money as possible from the Sword King, who’d left for Japan. It wasn’t to sell useless things to fans who couldn’t let go of him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘She must have handled everything alone to avoid disturbing my training.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With this much, there was no need to add more items to the auction.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ve chosen the items well. You’d have received backlash if you put up something like your father’s personal belongings.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle, there’s no way I’d auction off such things. Even as his daughter, I feel a bit weird when I see my dad’s stuff…” Saeah made an uncomfortable expression, then quickly changed it.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like she didn’t want to reveal the emotions she was feeling from looking at the things her father had left behind.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anyway… Uncle! I found a good Battle Tube channel.” Her voice sounded brighter than before.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah’s expression shifted from gloomy to bright as she spoke, her voice now sounding even more cheerful than before.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah? What is it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  And Seong Jihan, pretending not to notice her change in demeanor, responded naturally.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Remember when you mentioned the request to find the Shadow Queen before?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Not having much to do by himself, he hadn’t placed high expectations on that task and had left it to her.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Could it be… you’ve found some leads?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehe. Uncle, you know there are all sorts of people in the world, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah gestured for him to follow her.
 </p>
 <p>
  She led him to the home theater room located on one side of the penthouse.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">

 <p>
  And on the wall of the dimly lit room was a screen displaying something.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s eyes widened.
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the screen, the elves in the Colosseum’s stands were greatly magnified.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Among the Battle Tubers, there are content creators from different races.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Different races… content creators?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. Mainly archers with Scoping-type gifts. Among these people, there are those who specialize in recording content of their own race.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Scoping-type gifts allowed a broader field of view and were not very useful at lower levels but became quite valuable in higher leagues.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘To use such a good ability to record first-person videos…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan found it absurd.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nevertheless, the Battle Tubers were looking at each elf one by one, showering them with admiration.

   In response to his rough breathing, Yoon Seah frowned and muted the video.

   “Haha, okay.”

 </p>
 <p>

   Seong Jihan smirked and looked at the screen on the wall.

   Seong Jihan looked around for the remote control and pressed various buttons.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   This remote control from the past was quite different from the future’s, and he wasn’t sure which button did what.

   Seong Jihan realized something when he saw this.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   ‘This… seems to be videos from the past when she was a fan.’ Yoon Seah had become proficient in video editing, an idol of fandom.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   And the subject was none other than Sword King Yoon Sejin.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   ‘…It’s quite plausible. After all, Seah admired her father.’
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   He was ranked 3rd in the world and 1st in the Warrior class.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   The Sword King Yoon Sejin, a name known to everyone around the world.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   He had a gentle and harmonious personality and cherished his only daughter greatly.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   He was a father that any child would love and admire.

  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   Even though there was no correlation between the rank and inheritance of gifts…Still, people’s psychology led them to expect that if both parents had exceptional gifts, their child should too.

 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   “This country was no different.”
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   Even the nation wondered if Yoon Seah would receive a remarkable gift that would follow in the Sword King’s footsteps.

 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   Until just before her birthday, despite public criticism, they had taken a stance to protect her.

 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   But when her birthday arrived…The gift Yoon Seah received was shocking.

  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   “It was F-rank.”
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   An F-rank gift, which was considered not much better than having no gift at all.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   That birthday, Jihan saw despair on Saeah’s face for the first time. She’d even managed to remain calm when Sword King Yoon Saejin had left for Japan, but after receiving an F-rank Gift on her birthday, she couldn’t maintain her façade.

 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   ‘That Gift was Saeah’s last hope, after all…’

 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   When she was being criticized by the nation as the daughter of Sword King Yoon Sejin, The only thing that could potentially turn the situation around was receiving an exceptional gift but the gift she received was F-rank.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   The public responded by criticizing and ridiculing her, saying that her father had left her behind because of her talent
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   ‘But they didn’t know the value of that gift at that time.’

   When it was revealed that the world’s ranked 2nd, from China, had the same Gift as her, it was already too late… By that time, Yoon Saeah had already left the world.

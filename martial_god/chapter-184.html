  Chapter 184
 </h3>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  Chapter 184
 </p>
 <p>
  On December 15th, the day of the rehearsal game.
 </p>
 <p>
  The start of the game was similar as usual.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Crazy… What is this guy…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The species encountering humanity for the first time charged in after just looking at their appearance, only to be completely smashed by Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  [NO.4212…! That’s the race he’s in. Avoid them.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The species who met humanity early in the previous rehearsals fled with all their might just seeing them.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It feels even harder to raise points than before…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah looked at the escaping enemies with a regretful face.
 </p>
 <p>
  The race that had suffered a defeat from Seong Jihan never tried to fight.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just seeing humans from a distance, they would escape with all their might.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They run away as soon as they see Seong Jihan. There should be more races coming in.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right. Moreover, there are many enemies targeting us during the time the sky flips.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Waiting for the moment of the Reversal, when the sky and the earth are overturned. At the time when humanity was in chaos, more than one race carried out surprise attacks.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, Seong Jihan showed a powerful response even at this time.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No matter what, it’s too much for my uncle alone…”
 </p>
 <p>
  During the moment of the Reversal, it was impossible for Seong Jihan to take care of all the expedition teams.
 </p>
 <p>
  No, in fact.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Even though it’s possible to take care of everything…I’m pretending that it is impossible.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He had the ability, but wanted to make it look impossible since there were still things to gain from the chaotic rifts.
 </p>
 <p>
  So Seong Jihan decided they had to maintain this state for a while.
 </p>
 <p>
  “At this rate, we really might not clear it huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nah, we’ll definitely clear eventually.”
 </p>
 <p>
  So she was more at ease than Sophia who was genuinely worried about clearing, but
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If we keep this up, the enemies’ responses will get quicker I think….’
 </p>
 <p>
  Around the 15th, she was a bit worried.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I hope they respond well during the world flip.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, the game continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  When the points of the expedition team reached about 5,000.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The world is turning…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Everyone, get ready!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The time for the Reversal, which repeatedly tripped up the expedition team, was approaching.
 </p>
 <p>
  And, as usual.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Captain… shall we start again today…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, it seems like they are trying to negotiate. We shouldn’t clear the game before that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But will Seong Jihan accept the negotiation? If he knows what we did…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The moderates went. They won’t blatantly reveal it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The People’s guild players were about to attempt suicide again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Behind them.
 </p>
 <p>
  A small shadow in the shape of a sword rose and disappeared without them noticing.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Chaotic Rift has expanded, and the world is overturned.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Rumble…!
 </p>
 <p>
  When the heavens and earth flipped, sending the entire expedition team floating in the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, standing far away.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s time.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He tore the First-person perspective sensory sharing ticket purchased from the battle market.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then
 </p>
 <p>
  -Huh…?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -What’s this?
 </p>
 <p>
  Changes occurred in the live broadcast of Seong Jihan’s video broadcast worldwide on the BattleTube.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  The first thing viewers saw was a multi-viewpoint perspective.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wha…! Why are so many screens popping up suddenly?!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Looks like I’ll need 20 monitors set up.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -That’s not Oppa Seong Jihan’s screen, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead of one screen from Seong Jihan’s viewpoint, The screen was divided into 20.
 </p>
 <p>
  To allow ordinary people to fully feel Seong Jihan’s normal senses, Even this much was insufficient.
 </p>
 <p>
  But also capturing his five senses completely was impossible due to ordinary people’s limitations.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright, let’s start again. Fall to the ground.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Magicians, use gravity reinforcement instead of reverse gravity.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Supporters, use dispelling magic instead of barriers.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Quickly… Die!”
 </p>
 <p>
  -What? Fall to the ground he says…
 </p>

 <p>
  -Suicide? In this situation?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Who is this…?
 </p>
 <p>
  And as if to satisfy the viewers’ curiosity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The sword-shaped shadow abruptly sprouted from the People’s guild players’ backs.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, I just have to illuminate them, right?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan and Ariel’s voices were heard.
 </p>
 <p>
  The People’s guild players appeared on the 20 screens.
 </p>
 <p>
  As they each tried to attempt suicide while floating in the air, those players
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wha, what is this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The shadow sword…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  With surprised faces, they looked at the sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  As for who owned the Shadow Sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no one on Earth who didn’t know by now.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No way…’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘We’ve been caught…!’
 </p>
 <p>
  The faces of the People’s guild players turned contemplative.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, facing the viewers watching his broadcast, calmly opened his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The world flip. It’s been two weeks since this phenomenon occurred. The association has undergone sufficient training, and we all did well during practice. However.””
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  The Shadow Sword, which was initially as small as a fingernail, gradually grew.
 </p>
 <p>
  The blade reached the point of strangling the neck.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I wondered why only the actual games failed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I… This is…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “T-This is a personal mistake!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I-I actually wanted to level up more on this map…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Players desperately tried not to be associated with People’s guild, claiming it was a personal indulgence.
 </p>
 <p>
  But.
 </p>
 <p>
  Such excuses were in vain, as the mark of People’s guild was proudly attached to their armor and robe hems.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Intentional suicide…!
 </p>
 <p>
  -Whoa… so the People’s guild has been intentionally hindering the clear until now?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Why…? Are they crazy?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -How many people are dying in the clear right now… and there are so many People’s guild players in the expedition team, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  The rehearsal map that offered an incredible bonus of 7 stat points.
 </p>
 <p>
  All players were eager to clear it as soon as possible and invest in it.
 </p>
 <p>
  And now, these players intentionally hindered it until now?
 </p>
 <p>
  Even after watching the video, people couldn’t believe this event.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ah, don’t tell me it’s because they didn’t add Wang Lin last time?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -…Really? They ruined the expedition just because of that?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -There’s gotta be something else. Why would they die for no reason?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Seriously, it’s ridiculous! They’re all gaining stat +7 benefits anyway.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Preposterous accusations! Their actions have nothing to do with the People’s guild!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -But all 20 who tried to commit suicide are from the People’s guild, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  Recalling the recent conflicts between Seong Jihan and People’s guild, people were horrified.
 </p>
 <p>
  Could the People’s guild really have trolled by intentionally ruining the game just because they didn’t add Wang Lin to the party…?
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s no use now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan touched his neck with his fingers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, the shadow sword that had grown in front of the 20 people began to move simultaneously.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  The People’s guild players’ necks were severed simultaneously.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Whoa…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Seong Jihan killed them…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Ah, he’s killing his allies!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -What the hell is this?
 </p>
 <p>
  The Chinese viewers, who were quiet until a while ago, went wild as all the People’s guild players were executed.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a cold face, Seong Jihan, putting his weapons in the inventory and clenching his fist, closed his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Now is the time.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [We have to reduce numbers here!]
 </p>
 <p>
  When the world reversed and returned after the Earth had turned upside down, in the situation where the demon race was attacking the expedition team that had fallen to the ground.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})

 <p>
  Seong Jihan stood alone on the lightning cloud, quietly looking at the battlefield.
 </p>
 <p>
  When he finally stepped forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… uncle, thank you!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong! Thanks to you, I survived!”
 </p>
 <p>
  His close acquaintances like Yoon Seah and Sophia, who were in crisis, thanked him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey! What about me…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  He completely ignored others like Barren.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Team’s survival rate has dropped below 10%.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You will be expelled from the map in 15 minutes.]
 </p>
 <p>
  When the team annihilation message appeared with less than 10% expedition survivors remaining.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who had kept silent with eyes closed, opened his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “From now on, I will expel all People’s guild players from the expedition team. However, if the World BattleNet Association continues including People’s guild players on the roster…”
 </p>
 <p>
  He firmly finished speaking.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Rehearsal games will never open again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  And so, the game on that day came to an end.
 </p>
 <p>
  It caused a massive impact worldwide.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  [The reason why the rehearsal hasn’t been cleared until now… Shocking revelations unfold!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Why did the People’s guild commit such acts? Clues are found in Seong Jihan’s mention of Wang Lin at the beginning of the month.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Heavenly Demon Wang Lin says he is completely unaware of this and firmly declined interviews.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The People’s guild completely denies this, claiming it arose from individual’s deviations.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The World BattleNet Association expects agreement on expelling the problematic players.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As usual, Seong Jihan found himself at the center of numerous news reports. However, this time, the impact was significant.
 </p>
 <p>
  =It has already been a week since rehearsal games stopped opening. The World BattleNet Association tried mediating between player Seong Jihan and the People’s guild, but has repeatedly failed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then Daegi Guild representative Lee Hayeon appeared in the news.
 </p>
 <p>
  She answered the reporter’s questions with a cold expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Our side’s demand is simple. Please exclude all players from the People’s guild and related parties. We will not accept anything besides that.
 </p>
 <p>
  And next, the contrasting World BattleNet Association representative.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Attributing the mistakes of individuals to the entire People’s guild is disappointing. We cannot help but feel let down by player Seong Jihan. Excluding the entire People’s guild will also negatively impact clearing the rehearsal mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  We hope to resolve this by replacing the players who caused this irregular incident, and selecting proper elites. The People’s guild also acknowledges their insufficient player management, and has agreed to donate 500 flight magic items.
 </p>
 <p>
  =So does that mean the People’s guild won’t be excluded?
 </p>
 <p>
  =Yes… that is currently the case. We expect player Seong Jihan to make a generous decision for the greater good. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  The People’s guild occupied considerable influence within the Association.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus the Association could not accept Seong Jihan’s demand.
 </p>
 <p>
  And although Seong Jihan gained worldwide support after the People’s guild suicide attempts were exposed,
 </p>
 <p>
  One country was an exception.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, Uncle. Look at this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  =Meanwhile, public opinion is heated in China. Newspaper editorials are attacking him, saying Seong Jihan pinned crimes on the People’s guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  After the news anchor’s briefing,
 </p>
 <p>
  Scenes of people burning piles of things appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Seong Jihan’s fans in China also expressed huge disappointment, holding events burning Seong Jihan products after losing faith in him due to this incident.
 </p>
 <p>
  -I became his fan after seeing Seong Jihan’s activities, but completely lost interest after this. How can he blame the entire People’s guild for individuals’ mistakes?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -I agree. People shouldn’t do that!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -This broadcast insulted our country!
 </p>
 <p>
  The items for fans, including Seong Jihan’s pictures, were burning in heaps.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah watched with a look of disbelief and asked Seong Jihan, “Uncle, did you sell products too?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Would I do that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, are they burning what they made themselves?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s probably it. Well, let them burn.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching his own face burning, Seong Jihan smiled wryly.
 </p>
 <p>
  He never expected such a reaction from his fans.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But Uncle… are you really not doing the rehearsal?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why, do you want to?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, well. Hehe. Losing 7 stat points is a bit regrettable but your position takes priority!”
 </p>
 <p>
  But Yoon Seah still subtly glanced at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps because she became a seasoned player, she seemed to covet the stat +7.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The expedition won’t happen if the association doesn’t change the list.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right… that’s how it should be! We can’t yield here!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But I’ll still have to give you your stat bonus.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah… that means…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan pointed to himself with his finger.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I powered up recently.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ” ….. from there?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Since the association was urging them to reach an agreement.
 </p>
 <p>
  They thought that without them, the game would eventually not be cleared.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now I can clear the rehearsal through matchmaking.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As his Martial soul reached 200, the situation has completely changed.

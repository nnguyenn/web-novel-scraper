  Chapter 185

  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  Chapter 185
 </p>
 <p>
  “You can clear the rehearsal with matchmaking…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah asked in surprise.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, of course uncle can smash them all no matter what other races appear, but… we humans would get in the way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m at a level now where that won’t happen.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Martial Soul 200.
 </p>
 <p>
  This ability, completed through the fragments of a dead star, boasted overwhelming power.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Now I’m definitely stronger than my previous life.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Although he was 7th in the world rankings in his past life, in reality he was the strongest on Earth.
 </p>
 <p>
  He wondered when he would catch up to that level, and through this Chaotic Battlefield he was definitely able to surpass it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Level 183… With this I probably won’t become a Diamond even after clearing the Chaotic Battlefield.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The official opening match of the Space League on January 1st.
 </p>
 <p>
  There, Seong Jihan had to be ‘Platinum’.
 </p>
 <p>
  He could have gone up to Diamond and fought enemies as Earth’s representative, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There’s no way to deal huge damage to them.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Recalling the shocking incident that occurred in the opening match of his previous life.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan once again made up his mind to remain Platinum this year.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I do feel a bit sorry for the people who worked hard until now, they trained for a long time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The people from the expedition?”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Yoon Seah’s words, Seong Jihan recalled the expedition members who worked quite hard recently.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were probably grinding their teeth because they couldn’t clear early due to the People’s guild’s suicide chaos.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll have to take care of them.’
 </p>
 <p>
  They invested time and effort so he couldn’t just give the stat bonuses to some random matchmaking players instead of the expedition team.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll have to contact the expedition members. And ask if they’ll come for matchmaking.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, that’s possible with matchmaking?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. I decide the rehearsal game team composition.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So in the end, the expedition without the People’s guild?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’ll change more if some don’t come.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who wouldn’t come?”
 </p>
 <p>
  With the +7 stat points, they even gave up on the promotional matches.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Will they attend on Christmas Eve?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Christmas Eve… it’s already that time?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, the day after tomorrow.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded as if it worked out well.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay. Then let’s set it that day.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In order to remain Platinum in December,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to end the rehearsal on the 24th.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Christmas Eve of 2020.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the rehearsal game issues amid the approaching Space League opening,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Everyone, it’s been a while.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan turned on his BattleTube, countless viewers flocked in.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh….
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -The broadcast is on!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -It’s the rehearsal waiting room.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Did he finally reach an agreement with the Association?
 </p>
 <p>
  People wondered about the rehearsal game resuming like this, but
 </p>
 <p>
  “I haven’t reached any agreement with them. Today, I will end the rehearsal game with matchmaking.”
 </p>
 <p>
  -Th…through matching…?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -No way. Allies keep dying and the game ends every time.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -How can we break through with random matching?
 </p>
 <p>
  Most people reacted worriedly when Seong Jihan said matchmaking.
 </p>
 <p>
  With allies dropping below 10% survivors each time, ending around 6,000-7,000 points.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s possible now. Ah, and the original expedition members worked hard until now, so I plan to prioritize them for matchmaking. Excluding the People’s guild of course.”
 </p>
 <p>
  -Giving expedition priority is better I guess.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Yeah, lots of warriors and supporters.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Oh, but that leaves 60 spots from the People’s guild right…?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Getting in those 60 spots would be a jackpot for whoever’s picked!!
 </p>
 <p>
  -Right? Is this a Christmas present?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Is there a level limit?
 </p>
 <p>
  “No limits on level, class, anything. Anyone can join.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s leisurely declaration,
 </p>
 <p>
  The eyes of Platinum players worldwide flipped over.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Please start a bit later! I’ll wrap up my Christmas Eve date and drive over.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -For real, the +7 stats are way more precious than some date.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -You’re not even guaranteed to clear the game this time…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -No, no. Seeing Seong Jihan so confident, it seems like something’s going to happen..
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s how the team formation began.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m Dennis, a member of the expedition team from Ireland!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay, please wait.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As if they’d been waiting, expedition members started entering one by one, and
 </p>
 <p>
  “439 members of the expedition team have all participated. Now, let’s proceed with the random selection of 60 spots.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan started the game like this,
 </p>
 <p>
  -Seong Jihan! To proceed with the game like this…! The alliance will never overlook this!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -To proceed with the game excluding the People’s guild. Is it really going to be like this?
 </p>
 <p>
  The World BattleNet Association and People’s guild strongly protested through BattleTube, but
 </p>
 <p>
  He lightly ignored them and continued the random matching.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I… I’m very sorry about last time. But please, just once…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Leave.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan! I’m Wang Lin! Please give me one chance…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I won’t accept players from that guild. Go away.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Various happenings occurred, like problematic expedition members from the People’s Association trying to sneak in,
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  And Heavenly Demon Wang Lin attempting to cling on before being forcibly removed, but
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s everyone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He was eventually able to complete the 500 player composition.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The randomly added 60, didn’t even check their levels and accepted all besides that guild.’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Will we really be able to clear it..?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the completely randomly selected 60 were players who just reached Platinum at level 100-something.
 </p>
 <p>
  And many were Archer classes most useless for survival.
 </p>
 <p>
  With teamwork harder to coordinate than the original expedition, clearing the mission would be difficult right?
 </p>
 <p>
  The expedition’s worries weren’t unreasonable.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t defend from now on.”
 </p>
 <p>
  But Seong Jihan was nonchalant.
 </p>
 <p>
  [All players have gathered.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Commencing game.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Assigned map: Chaos Battlefield]
 </p>
 <p>
  And so the game began.
 </p>
 <p>
  As always, the moment the map opened,
 </p>
 <p>
  The concentrated attack of species waiting in ambush poured out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The attack this time was green smoke breathed out by massive snakes,
 </p>
 <p>
  Containing strong toxins that immediately threatened the expedition.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Cast Shield Binding…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  To block the powerful poison attack, the expedition team tried to establish defenses like before, however
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s fine.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, holding the eclipse shadow sword, took out two more swords from his inventory
 </p>
 <p>
  And stabbed them into the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nameless Divine Arts, Annihilation God’s Secret – Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Myriad Ghost Sealing God’s pattern was barely visible when Martial Soul was low.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the pattern Seong Jihan drew now was different.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods was large enough for 10 people to stand on densely covered ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  And unlike usual, the three swords didn’t break, remaining intact.
 </p>
 <p>
  After the patterns were all drawn with the swords.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan smiled slightly at the expedition.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Rest a bit, it’ll be over soon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Right after he finished speaking.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wha, what is this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The patterns shone and the entire 499 expedition members started getting sucked into them.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No need to only use Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods to confine souls.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Like how he also used Blood Cross as a shield.
 </p>
 <p>
  Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods didn’t have to only be used to dominate enemies’ souls.
 </p>
 <p>
  Using it like this to simply contain allies hindering them, blocking death penalties, was fine too.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I couldn’t have modified it without Martial Soul’s growth.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With Martial Soul at 150, Seong Jihan struggled just to draw the patterns.
 </p>
 <p>
  But now it has grown to 200, he clearly had leisure to use Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods for purposes besides its original use.
 </p>
 <p>
  Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods which should’ve confined souls and annihilated them
 </p>
 <p>
  Just quietly contained players now.
 </p>
 <p>
  That 50 point difference in Martial Soul made a tremendous difference.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uwaaaaah…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Before the toxic gas could reach them, Seong Jihan’s Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods sucked in the entire 499 expedition members.
 </p>
 <p>
  After tidying up the burdens together, Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  […What is this?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [An internal conflict?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The summoned race seems strange this time.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Faced the giant snake species looking at him strangely, and picked up his Phoenix Flag.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Give me your kill points.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In response to the words uttered by a lifeform that was less than 1/10 of its size, the giant snake swarm opened its mouth wide.
 </p>
 <p>
  [A madman it was.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Quickly take care of him. We need to move locations.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Got it.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the smoke was about to emerge again from the snake’s mouth, Seong Jihan’s figure disappeared in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  In the entire body of the snake that had opened its mouth, a red current surged.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The giant snake burst into flames and disappeared in an instant. The disappearance of one happened so quickly that there was no time to scream.
 </p>
 <p>
  [What… what is this?]
 </p>
 <p>
  When the giant snake, unable to comprehend the situation, momentarily shrank its body,
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  “You guys give 25 points per one, huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan appeared in front of them, extending his spear once again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nameless divine art, Fusion of Divine thunder and phoenix – Crimson Thunder cannon
 </p>
 <p>
  The crimson thunder released from the spear spread like a tidal wave, knocking down the entire group of giant snakes, numbering up to 19.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This power is…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Unbearable…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [We’ve lost this battlefield it seems…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [NO. 4212…! I’ll remember it….]
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan led the human expedition in the chaos battlefield for a while, many enemies knew about NO.4212. However, the snake species, unfamiliar with humans and coming after a long time, had no knowledge about it.
 </p>
 <p>
  After the snakes were annihilated by Crimson Thunder in an instant, Seong Jihan glanced at the Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please rest for a bit. I’ll quickly end this and come back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s figure disappeared, and soon after…
 </p>
 <p>
  [This guy! He’s still here…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [What, he got stronger!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [I-I can’t escape. He’s so fast…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Screams from members of other species echoed in the distance.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Chaos Battlefield.
 </p>
 <p>
  A map where species worth 500 points gathered for team play.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the game today completely differed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Is this guy… a boss monster?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [No! He’s from a race! NO.4212!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [At that level… he’s worth 500 points alone!!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Is humanity… a new divine existence?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Was it because Seong Jihan’s might was so overwhelming?
 </p>
 <p>
  The species facing him mistook Seong Jihan for a godly race.

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  -Whoa… this map was so easy?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Sealing the burdens makes it end in one go…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -But Seong Jihan seems stronger, right?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Yeah, he’s shooting crimson thunder in barrages now.
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers familiar with Seong Jihan’s broadcasts could sense that he had upgraded another level. Despite not playing games lately and being in a seclusion, how did he become even stronger?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Chaos Battlefield. It was indeed a grateful map.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Rumble…!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the ground vibrated, a chaos rift appeared. Seong Jihan gazed affectionately at it.
 </p>
 <p>
  The fragments of dead stars hidden within the Rifts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks to those, his Martial Soul which hadn’t been growing well had grown tremendously.
 </p>
 <p>
  He would’ve wanted to keep staying here mining star fragments if Martial Soul’s growth didn’t stop now.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But growth has ceased now, so I should end it now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  And the Space League opening match was approaching soon, so he had to prepare for that too.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the scoreboard.
 </p>
 <p>
  1st – NO.4212 Humanity – Kill Points 9994
 </p>
 <p>
  Just 6 more points to hit 1st place and end Chaos Battlefield.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan went around looking for prey and
 </p>
 <p>
  [Oh, run…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s him!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The gargoyle species he massacred before.
 </p>
 <p>
  The enemies who immediately turned away seeing him.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  “How many points were you guys again?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [What, how did he suddenly…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The ones who had only grown to platinum couldn’t escape from Seong Jihan, who had grown even stronger.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay. Just the six of you come out. I’ll spare the rest.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [What nonsense is that…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [We’re only 2 points! You just need to deal with the three of us!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hey! What are you saying!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Who are you to say we should die?! It’s just a game, we have to preserve our strength!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [This punk…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Snap!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan beheaded the gargoyle making a fuss alone and checked the scoreboard.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really 2 points each huh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […….]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then just 2 come out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I, I’ll go…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Again?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The gargoyle who talked realistically earlier volunteered, but with no other volunteers after,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked around at them before beheading the gargoyle most heavily injured.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Kuk…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’ll be better for you guys once we leave, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ye, yes! Let’s hurry!]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the realist gargoyle hurriedly rushed him,
 </p>
 <p>
  “You guys left your friend very well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan chuckled and moved towards where Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods was installed.
 </p>
 <p>
  And pulling out the Eclipse sword among the 3 swords stabbed into the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Smoke seeped from the ground and
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What, what is this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The players trapped in Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods began pouring out in bundles.
 </p>
 <p>
  With clueless expressions, they looked at each other then
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now, everyone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing Seong Jihan call them, they looked his way together.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ve worked hard. Here’s your Christmas present, now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  Once he finished speaking, the gargoyles’ bodies exploded.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’ve achieved 10,000 kill points.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’ve conquered Chaos Battlefield.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’ve cleared a special mission.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Entire race gains growth bonus for 5 years.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Additional 7 stat points given to participating players.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The same message popped up for all players who quietly remained trapped in Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We, we cleared it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “When?”Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  After first going blank from the message, just for a moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Whoa, crazy!!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “7 points…! They really came!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Whoa!!I got picked randomly today so I got in… jackpot!!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The players who gained additional points went nuts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just remaining docility trapped then released, yet
 </p>
 <p>
  What was this absurd reward?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow, this is amazing! lol
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -The expedition team was quite tough, but look at them!!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Those who got picked hit jackpot luck
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -People’s guild kept saying they’d struggle without their players
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Clearing it in just one day~
 </p>
 <p>
  And Seong Jihan’s reward message was similar to other players’,
 </p>
 <p>
  However
 </p>
 <p>
  There was an additional line at the end.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Selected as the race MVP, additional MVP rewards will be given!]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘MVP reward…,’ considering how much he gained on this map.
 </p>
 <p>
  They even gave a gift until the end.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan faintly smiled collecting his reward,
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, from the Star of the Wandering Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hmmm….]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the changed form of Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods Seong Jihan used, the star’s owner
 </p>
 <p>
  [As expected… It’s still useful.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Expressed satisfaction.

  Chapter 187

 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  Chapter 187
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mom… is alive? Really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah asked with an unbelieving expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jiah using sacrifice then turning to stone, consumed by darkness, was still vivid in her mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, when Yoon Sejin mentioned going to explore North Korea, Her expectations weren’t that high but…
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, it’s too early to conclude. The ring reacted slightly, that’s all.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How did it react?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “When clearing the fourth dungeon, the ring itself vibrated strongly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Saying that, Yoon Saejin took out the necklace with the ring hanging on it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It wasn’t the vibration felt when clearing dungeons. It was a movement originating from the ring itself.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh… the color of that ring changed a bit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right… I couldn’t tell since I cant see”
 </p>
 <p>
  Previously shining pure white, the ring now had traces of blackish purple.
 </p>
 <p>
  “May I see it for a moment?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Go ahead.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan received the ring and carefully observed traces of light.
 </p>
 <p>
  The aura was similar to dark magic power but felt slightly different somehow.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ariel. Do you know anything about this energy?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hmm… I can’t tell with just this much either. Doesn’t seem like shadow energy.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps because the remaining magic power on the ring was too little, even Ariel the shadow elf didn’t know.
 </p>
 <p>
  ”It seems different from the death aura I saw on the chaos battlefield…”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was unable to discern the energy, Yoon Seah who had been observing intently next to him swiftly snatched the ring.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, this… seems related to the Void?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Void?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, I’m a Void Archer. I’m familiar with the power of the Void.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Saying so, Yoon Seah drew her bow and released a Void Arrow. The purple light flickered for a moment, then the arrow disappeared, becoming transparent.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come out now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Yoon Seah swung her bow, the disappearing arrow reappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It really is huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed, the power felt from her arrow was similar to the ring’s energy. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  Now certain this energy was void,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  The light from the ring and the Void Arrow resonated.
 </p>
 <p>
  A brief sound emanated from the ring.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Yoon…
 </p>
 <p>
  Just saying ‘Yoon,’ the voice was cut off.
 </p>
 <p>
  With just that, it was possible to identify whose voice it was.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh!? This… Mom!?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Yes. It sounds like my sister’s voice.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Is my sister really somewhere in North Korean territory?
 </p>
 <p>
  After hearing the voice, Seong Jihan couldn’t stay still.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Brother-in-law, I’ll help with dungeon clearing too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No… it’s okay for now. We need to clear the dungeon with the ring, and it’s not a lack of force in clearing. We actually need more support for other things.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so? Is there a shortage of Exploration Gift players in the Alliance Investigation team?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The support from the investigation team is fine, but the problem is the players with the ‘Exploration’ supporting gift. It’s not as easy to find dungeon cores as I thought. Moreover, the exploration abilities of the players sent to Korea are at B to C levels.”
 </p>
 <p>
  On top of that, after finding one, it took time to organize dungeon-related information and upload it to the alliance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even when the Sword King personally swept away dungeon monsters, the progress didn’t seem to advance smoothly, and there was a reason for this.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you have a player with exploration… should I give it a try?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this voice… the guild master?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, that’s right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps because it was Christmas, Lee Hayeon came dressed more powerfully than usual. Listening quietly to the conversation, she decided to join in on the current topic.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I heard that Divergent Guild, which used to secure a lot of exploration abilities, is now making fun of them because they have nowhere to use them. I’ll borrow someone from there.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wouldn’t the Divergent guild pester you for that? Saying you should return to the guild and all.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s okay, Boss. If they bother us, we can contact other top guilds. Divergent guild is not the only guild that has secured people with exploration gifts.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon answered with a relaxed face. Being the guild master of a top guild and having dealt with world-class figures, she wasn’t particularly worried about Korean top guilds now.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, please do. Ah, and we will scout excellent exploration players from this side. You can use as much GP as you want.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, Boss. In Korea, B-rank is the highest, but…”
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  “B-rank is the highest? Didn’t the supporting gift grade increase last time? The difficulty was lowered.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, that’s why B-rank is the highest now. I’ll try to focus on scouting A-rank by turning our attention to overseas, as there may be more talented individuals there.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Since his sister Seong Jiah’s voice came out,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to organize an investigation team directly from the guild rather than just rely on the Association support team.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was a pile of GP that had accumulated because there was no place to use it at the moment, so it was time to use it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll also provide Akashic Pages to A-rank ability holders. That should be enticing enough.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, Akashic Pages…? The price of those has been skyrocketing lately…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I happen to have some.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to utilize the Akashic Pages obtained from Shizuru.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle, if you’ll use Akashic Pages can I ask someone I know to join too?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sofia’s brother. I heard he raised his exploration ability to A-rank due to the difficulty reduction.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If it was Sofia’s brother, it was Christoph, who frequently appeared as a commentator during international BattleNet matches. He held a firm position in the BattleNet industry globally, so whether he would accept the proposal was unknown.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sure. Let’s ask.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. With Akashic Pages as bait, he might be interested.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Thank you for the support.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s my sister’s issue, of course.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you really sure I can’t go?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Sweeping through the inside of the dungeon is easy for me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If there’s anything you need help with, feel free to contact me anytime.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s words, Yoon Saejin slowly nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course. I hope the opening match ends quickly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, the opening match…! I completely forgot because of mom’s issue. Ariel, do you know what games will unfold?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah asked Ariel who was well-versed in the BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the constraints of the tutorial, Ariel had tried to provide as much information as possible within her knowledge.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Opening match? That’s up to you guys to decide. Just think of it as a game where you fight and kill, like usual in BattleNet. True to the essence of BattleNet. However…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “However?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Now, you can really die.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Really die? In the game?”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Ariel’s words, Yoon Seah’s face stiffened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you mean like when Boss cleared the promotion match? Death as a penalty?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. To decisively lower the rank of the opponent’s race below yours, killing the enemy’s core player is the best way.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well that’s true but…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Dying in a game… It’s hard to believe.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps due to having been immersed in BattleNet as a game for ten years, despite Ariel’s words, those who heard them couldn’t truly grasp the reality. Except for Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Countless players died during the opening match…’
 </p>
 <p>
  To those who couldn’t believe it.
 </p>
 <p>
  The incident that truly made them realize that real players could die was the disaster of the Space League opening match.
 </p>
 <p>
  With traps set up from the first game, the World Tree Alliance was waiting. Humanity, caught off guard, faced great confusion from the beginning.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s time to return the favor this time.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With not much time left until the opening match.
 </p>
 <p>
  He intentionally remained in Platinum this year to grow for this day.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s eyes sank coldly as he thought about the opening match game.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  [Sword King joins the Daegi guild!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Daegi Guild is recruiting people with exploration gifts. The basic salary is 5-10 times the existing salary. Akashic Pages for A-ranks?]
 </p>
 <p>
  After the Christmas meeting, the Daegi Guild immediately began searching for exploration abilities. With a generous investment using the money they had saved up until now, they offered extraordinary conditions, attracting a flood of people to the guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow, these conditions are insane…?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -They’re giving an Akashic Page? Wow, I heard it’s worth more than 500 billion these days.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Yeah, nowadays, with the popularity of nurturing gifts, each guild is calling it a bargain to create a second team.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Giving that to exploration abilities… Isn’t there a significant reward for clearing dungeons?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Yeah, there might be something. The Sword King has been exploring dungeons a lot lately, so maybe that’s why they’re investing like this…
 </p>
 <p>
  People wondered what he saw in his dungeon explorations to make such an investment.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  -But what about the opening match lineup??
 </p>
 <br/>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  -The list of 2,000 people was released.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -What kind of game are they playing with so many people?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -When is it coming next year?
 </p>
 <p>
  The hottest issue still remained the Space League opening match drawing near.
 </p>
 <p>
  After a decade-long tutorial, Earth is finally entering the main game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Humanity is more optimistic than worried about the world after the tutorial.
 </p>
 <p>
  They couldn’t wait to watch the opening match.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Jihan! I heard from Seah!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was on a video call from Sophia.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, about the exploration issue?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yep~ Brother refused saying he would never do exploration work until now… But when I talked about the Akashic Page, he showed interest! Brother, come talk to Jihan!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Player Seong, nice to meet you. I’m Christopher.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As if waiting, commentator Christopher popped his face into the video call.
 </p>
 <p>
  He looked at Seong Jihan with twinkling eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  [As a fan, it’s an honor to meet you! My little sister said something about my exploration gift, and until now, you’ve kept the secret well. Thank you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You talk too much. You can tell Jihan anything! We’re going to be family soon anway.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [He has a girlfriend, Player Seong… sigh… My sister is too young. I’m sorry.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [No, that’s…! I can’t say that.]
 </p>
 <p>
  […Anyway, Player Seong. I heard from Sophie but still can’t believe it, so let me confirm. Do you really plan to provide Akashic Pages?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But it’s not for selling them off. It has to be used to strengthen your abilities.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Of course! I didn’t want to use my exploration ability until now because it looked dangerous. but using it under Sword King’s protection should be fine. I’ll have to take a break from commentary for a while.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Although firmly established as a commentator in BattleNet circles,
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed Christopher didn’t want his support gift going to waste, showing a positive attitude.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Will you come immediately then?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ah… I still want to finish commentary for this opening match. It’s something I really wanted to do as a commentator. Since the Sword King is also participating in the opening match, shouldn’t the schedule be fine even if I come after finishing?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, there’s sufficient time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [But it’s really a shame! If Player Seong had become a Diamond, you could have participated in all the matches…]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Space League opening match approached, information about the opening match began to be gradually released through the system.
 </p>
 <p>
  One noticeable thing was participation requirements for matches 1 to 5.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Only Diamonds or higher can participate in the Space League.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Among them, the noticeable condition was the participation requirement for matches 1 to 5.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ah damn, Platinum couldn’t participate huh.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Seong Jihan can’t participate in the opening match!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -This is like a boomerang for not leveling up because of Shizuru.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -What about not properly leveling up because of the People’s guild?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Anyway, It can’t be helped
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the most powerful players on Earth, Seong Jihan, couldn’t participate, and people expressed their regrets.
 </p>
 <p>
  [But there are still 100 Platinum players on the reserve lineup. Maybe there’s a chance?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia, standing beside him, also spoke with a disappointed expression. Seong Jihan smiled slightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have a good feeling.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [A… feeling?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. I feel like I’ll be the MVP of this opening match.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Wait, you can’t be MVP without participating in the game. You have to play to get MVP.
 </p>
 <p>
  Christopher looked puzzled, but Seong Jihan spoke confidently.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll give you a present when you come to Korea, so bet on me for MVP.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan spoke with a face full of confidence.
 </p>
 <p>
  [But you need to be able to participate to receive MVP…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Is it really ok going to Korea believing this guy?
 </p>
 <p>
  Christopher became anxious whether he made the right choice.
 </p>
 <p>
  And a few days later, on Channel 0.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Everyone! The day has finally arrived…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The day of the opening match has arrived.
 </p>

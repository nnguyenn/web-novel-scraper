  Chapter 188
 </p>
 <p>
  January 1st, 2021.
 </p>
 <p>
  [NO.4212 Humanity’s tutorial ends.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Humanity is now part of the Space League – Bronze League.]
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s been 10 years since the advent of BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  Humanity has completed the long tutorial and is now facing the main game.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Changes after entering main game are as follows]
 </p>
 <p>
  As if a game underwent massive updates with long patch notes.
 </p>
 <p>
  System messages endlessly explained the changes.
 </p>
 <p>
  -When will we finish reading this;;
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Why did so many things change, huh?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Wait. Someone will probably summarize it hehe
 </p>
 <p>
  At first, people were overwhelmed by the vast amount of information uploaded.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  However, soon BattleNet experts stepped forward to organize the complex patch notes.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  Most of the changes occurred in the in-game, taking up 70% of the content, while global changes accounted for 30%.
 </p>
 <p>
  But what caught the attention and concern of ordinary people was mostly the latter.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dungeon portals will now appear more frequently.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Depending on the ranking in the Space League, the range of countries where dungeon portals appear will expand.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [To avoid falling to the lower ranks, maintain your rank in the league!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Currently, dungeon portals are only created in the lower 10% of BattleNet rankings.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unless it’s a case like boycotting BattleNet participation completely like North Korea, resulting in penalties leading to destruction.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dungeon portals did not appear nationwide, allowing countries to somehow maintain their existence.
 </p>
 <p>
  But now, in the main game, the frequency of dungeon portal creation is determined by the ranking in the Space League.
 </p>
 <p>
  Certainly, the sense of crisis that the world has changed was palpable.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [GP is no longer linked to dollars and is subject to exchange rate fluctuations based on the ranking in the Space League. If the ranking drops to the demotion zone, there will be a significant penalty in the exchange rate.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Even the price that was fixed at 1 dollar per GP until now fluctuated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Reactions to this change were varied among those involved with GP.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow, GP skyrocketed lolololol. I bought a full load because I had a bad feeling about the tutorial ending!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Where did those guys who said GP would become worthless after the tutorial go??Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Fck I listened to those guys and exchanged all my GP yesterday… I wanna go back to yesterday
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -How much is GP now?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -1.4 dollars, It skyrocketed 40% right after the tutorial ended.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Why is it rising so much?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Check patch notes. Now, if you don’t have GP, it’s the era where players die.
 </p>
 <p>
  The factor that caused the GP exchange rate to skyrocket, in addition to the change in the fixed exchange rate system, was the changes in the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  [BattleNet game deaths will now deduct GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you don’t have GP, you will face death.]
 </p>
 <p>
  With this tremendous penalty, players were buying more GP in advance, causing the rate to steadily rise.
 </p>
 <p>
  The GP, which was 1.4 dollars since the changes, had already surpassed 2 dollars in less than a couple of hours.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow, this is no joke. From the first day…?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -We must win the opening match. Then the GP rate will stabilize, and dungeon portals won’t appear.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -So, who’s the opponent?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -20 teams in the Space League except us shown as ‘??’. It’s like the rehearsal.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan conducted rehearsal games,
 </p>
 <p>
  Enemy species faced were shown as ‘??’, never seen before.
 </p>
 <p>
  Current enemies in Space League Bronze League were invisible for now too.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this state, without any information, the humanity’s representative team that started the opening match.
 </p>
 <p>
  [In 3 hours, the opening match will begin.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Three hours before the opening match, they were racking their brains.
 </p>
 <p>

 <p>
  ‘Geez… what a headache…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Earth’s representative team coach Davis sighed deeply.
 </p>
 <p>
  Currently in charge at American First, he had been the coach since 2018 and had led the team to victory in the World Champions League for three consecutive years.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although it was good to be recognized for such achievements when he was appointed as the coach of the Earth’s representative team,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Didn’t expect this much trouble…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The opening match of BattleNet entering the main game required significant preparation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Who knew things like bans and select cards would be added….’
 </p>
 <p>
  Ban and select cards were added after entering the main game.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  The ban card prevented a powerful player from the opposing team from participating in the game, and the select card increased the chance of a designated map appearing in each match.
 </p>
 <p>
  Depending on how these two cards were strategically used, it was possible to defeat the opponent with a disadvantageous lineup or, conversely, lose with an advantageous lineup.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The options within the cards are diverse.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In a hurry, Davis summoned all the Association’s strategic analysts.
 </p>
 <p>
  They urgently discussed how to use these cards in the opening match.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We have too little information about the opponent.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The most versatile ban card would be this right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The chosen ban card held the option prohibiting 3 random players among the opposing race top 10 from participating.
 </p>
 <p>
  Completely uninformed about the enemy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather than guessing a specific #1, safely cutting out 3 to start was safest.
 </p>
 <p>
  And in the select cards choosing maps,
 </p>
 <p>
  All maps used in previous tutorial games appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I think it would be better to play the games we’ve been playing so far.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Despite gathering 2,000 players, we never fought large scale battles.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Recent maps we played like Southgate would be most effective right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The rehearsal showed many flying species too… would siege maps have meaning?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If we’re being picky, there aren’t many decent maps. Southgate is better than training maps.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. Let’s prioritize Southgate. Anyway, even if we choose it, the probability will increase, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s true.”
 </p>
 <p>
  And so Earth’s representative team decided to primarily use select cards for the Southgate map.
 </p>
 <p>
  While doing everything the representative team could,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait… why is Player Seong Jihan not on the reserve list and on the main?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Coach Davis frowned as he watched the player list, noticing Seong Jihan’s presence.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Seong Jihan’s skills were excellent, Space League matches were only open to Diamond and above.
 </p>
 <p>
  Putting him on the main list was pointless.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan is a Platinum! He should be on the reserve list!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, well…”
 </p>
 <p>
  In response to the coach’s protest, a BattleNet Association official spoke with a troubled expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We made a promise to include him in the list no matter what happens in the Association during the rehearsal game.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But he cleared the rehearsal game alone, right? Is there a need for the Association to honor that promise?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Still, except for the People’s guild, everyone benefited from the Association’s chosen list… and the Sword King insists on including Seong Jihan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What? Sword King?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Davis couldn’t believe it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, even he wanted to send a player like Seong Jihan to the front lines if he could.
 </p>
 <p>
  But from the beginning, the condition for participation was Diamond or higher. Why go through the trouble of putting his name on the list?
 </p>
 <p>
  “But, still, out of 2,000 spots… Wouldn’t it be okay to let him take just one?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh…! What if the outcome is decided by that one spot…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But the Sword King is so stubborn… The Association has decided to honor the promise rather than let the issue escalate.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I didn’t see Seong Jihan that way… Alright. Let’s just move on from this one spot this time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the decision, Coach Davis expressed his disappointment to Seong Jihan, who seemed determined to be on the list using the connection with his brother-in-law.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seems we have to let go of one spot.’
 </p>
 <p>
  While hoping that the map selection wouldn’t fall on one of the maps involving 2,000 people,
 </p>
 <p>
  Davis, along with the coaching staff, confirmed the preparations for the opening match.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  =Everyone, the day has finally come…!
 </p>
 <p>
  =The opening match of the Space League is about to begin!
 </p>
 <p>
  The live broadcast on Channel 0 was receiving more attention than ever as BattleNet entered the main game, emphasizing the increased importance of the Space League.
 </p>
 <p>
  =With the end of the tutorial, many new systems have been added.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  =Especially noteworthy in this game are the ban and select systems!
 </p>
 <p>
  The commentators briefly briefed on the newly added systems and the decisions of the Earth’s representative team.
 </p>
 <p>
  As they talked about this, the screen flashed, and a message appeared, prompting them to raise their voices.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The opposing race for the Space League match is decided.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The opponent is ‘World Tree Elves – 71.’]
 </p>
 <p>
  =Oh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Finally, the opponent that was listed as ‘??’ is revealed…!
 </p>
 <p>
  =World Tree Elves 71…?
 </p>
 <p>
  =While we’re ‘Humanity’, their name seems unique!
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  World Tree Elves – 71.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no case where the races from the rehearsal game were represented in such a way.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  The opponent for the opening match had an unusual name.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the World Tree Elves gradually revealed themselves on the screen, the commentators couldn’t help but express admiration.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ohh… beautiful!
 </p>
 <p>
  =It’s the Elven image we are familiar with!
 </p>
 <p>
  =That’s right. Weren’t elves summoned in the Colosseum audience before? They’re extremely similar!
 </p>
 <p>
  Like the beautiful elves summoned in past Colosseum audience,
 </p>
 <p>
  This match’s elven opponents held utmost beauty, both male and female.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow… My eyes are blessed.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Each one looks like a supermodel, huh?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -How do we fight these guys?
 </p>
 <p>
  People were initially impressed by their appearance, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah…! But, if the opponent is Elves, it won’t be easy. Information about Elves isn’t just in the Colosseum stands!
 </p>
 <p>
  =There is more information about Elves? What is it, Christopher?
 </p>
 <p>
  =Yes! It played once on Seong Jihan’s channel. Would you like to see the data screen?
 </p>
 <p>
  When the BattleTube screen played the scene where Seong Jihan fought Elves to obtain the leaf of the World Tree, viewers transitioned from admiration to genuine concern.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ugh, but Elves… Their regenerative ability is insane.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Can we handle that…?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -We need to win the opening match, but I’m a bit worried
 </p>
 <p>
  Because it was Seong Jihan, they managed to defeat them
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  .
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  But can the other players on the representative team deal with the Elves like that?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  People were worried.
 </p>
 <p>
  The importance of racial preferences was evident, as seen in the chaos of the battlefield they had watched in advance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Elves with super-regenerative abilities were perceived as extremely dangerous opponents.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  =The first match is about to begin.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Starting from the Space League, each team’s coach comes out to use option cards, and the game proceeds.
 </p>
 <p>
  =For humanity, Coach Davis, and for the World Tree Elves, a figure translated as the High Commissioner.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the screen changed, it illuminated a white table that emerged from the darkness.
 </p>
 <p>
  Standing at both ends of the large table were Coach Davis for humanity and the beautiful Elf coach, the High Commissioner, wearing a white robe.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nice to meet you, everyone from humanity.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a clear voice, the woman smiled and spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Even their Coach is a woman…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Elves are just the best, really…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Just smiling completes the beauty, seriously How can appearance be so deceptive?
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers who were swept away by the Elf coach’s greeting were busy praising her just a moment ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  [For the first match, please choose the ban and select cards and place them on the table.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Here they are.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Following the system’s guidance, Coach Davis of humanity, regaining composure, placed the cards he had predetermined on the table.
 </p>
 <p>
  -What cards will Elves choose?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -They probably lack information too.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Oh please, just give us a familiar map…!
 </p>
 <p>
  In this 5-game, 3-win match-up, the first game is crucial.
 </p>
 <p>
  When all eyes are focused on the cards the Elf coach will draw.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a deep smile on her lips, the High Commissioner unexpectedly made her choice.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We will not use cards.”
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, In Humanity’s player waiting room where 2,000 players have been summoned.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is this…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why such a choice?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As humanity’s players puzzled over the Elf coach’s choice.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It has begun.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who doesn’t have the qualification to participate, stared at the smiling High Commissioner with sunken eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Laugh as much as you want now. Today’s game… won’t go as you think.’
 </p>

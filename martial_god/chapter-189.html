  Chapter 189
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah, what is this…?
 </p>
 <p>
  =The opposing team is not using ban cards or select cards!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Is it still possible to play the game like this?
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as the commentators were puzzled by the Elven Coach’s choice.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Oh…! According to the analysts, it is possible to play without using the two cards.
 </p>
 <p>
  =By collecting three ban cards like this, they can definitely use more bans starting from the 4th game!
 </p>
 <p>
  =if they gather 3 select cards, they can definitively choose maps!
 </p>
 <p>
  Having obtained information from the Association, the commentators were able to explain why the Elven Coach made that decision.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Additionally, if they make it to the 5th game after collecting 4 cards… there is a special effect allowing them to change the game options as well!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Changing options? What does that mean?
 </p>
 <p>
  =No detailed explanation was given. But since they’re giving up bans and selects for 4 games, there probably aren’t many options they can change.
 </p>
 <p>
  =But generally, isn’t it best to finish before the 5th game? Seems using ban and select cards every game would have the highest win rate instead of saving them…
 </p>
 <p>
  =You’re right. How do they know if they’ll make it to the 5th game! There’s a chance their saved cards could go to waste!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the commentators said, saving cards for later games instead of using them in earlier games was an inefficient choice.
 </p>
 <p>
  If they saved them for no reason and lost the first 3 games, the cards would go to waste without being used.
 </p>
 <p>
  And,
 </p>
 <p>
  [3 players from ‘World Tree Elves – 71’s top 10 are banned.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [1st, 3rd and 5th ranked players are banned. They cannot participate in the 1st game.]
 </p>
 <p>
  =Oh, 1st, 3rd and 5th ranked players! The ban card picked out well!
 </p>
 <p>
  =A good start!
 </p>
 <p>
  [The map for the 1st game has been decided.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The 1st game will take place on ‘Southgate’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Due to the opponent not using cards, humanity welcomed the best case scenario.
 </p>
 <p>
  The bans precisely took out the opponent’s top ranked players.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the game map was Southgate, the most familiar map from the tutorials.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Oh! It’s Southgate!
 </p>
 <p>
  =A familiar map appeared. If the opponents used a select card, there would have been a 70% chance one of the chosen maps between both sides appeared…
 </p>
 <p>
  =This is the best outcome for humanity! Please win the first game!
 </p>
 <p>
  On the Southgate map requiring 100 players.
 </p>
 <p>
  Following the predetermined lineup for when this map appeared among the 2,000 players.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players were called up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll be back, brother-in-law.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sword King, 1st ranked Warrior Class, was the first to stand up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m also participating since it’s Southgate. Too bad Seong Jihan isn’t here….”
 </p>
 <p>
  Top Korean player and 1st ranked Archer Class, Ha Yeonjoo also made the 100 players participating in the 1st game.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll be in your care as well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, I’ll definitely bring back a win!”
 </p>
 <p>
  And so, among the 100 players, 2 Koreans were included as the lineup for the 1st game was finalized.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It would’ve been nice if Seong Jihan was here too…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Too bad he isn’t Diamond.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then why is he even on the list of 2,000?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right? He can’t play anyway unless he’s Diamond so there was no need to include him in the list.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Those not participating in game 1 chatted amongst themselves, glancing at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  While his skills were recognized by all, They didn’t understand why a Platinum unable to play matches was on the lineup.
 </p>
 <p>
  “He probably just wanted to be included in humanity’s first ever lineup, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Does a top player like Seong Jihan care about things like that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If he cared then he should’ve ranked up to Diamond faster….”
 </p>
 <p>
  Various negative chatter surrounded Seong Jihan but
 </p>
 <p>
  =Game, begin!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the 1st game of the opening match kicked off, all eyes focused there.
 </p>
 <p>
  Humanity vs Elves.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nothing was a greater spectacle than this first confrontation.
 </p>
 <p>
  And,
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah~ Sword King! He’s devastating the enemy camp! The Elven warriors are trying to stop him but can’t respond at all!
 </p>
 <p>
  =World Tree Elves, if you would fall so easily then why didn’t you use ban cards? This makes no sense!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Elven base, located at the fortress.
 </p>
 <p>
  They took out bows, summoned spirits and prepared defenses, but
 </p>
 <p>
  With Sword King taking the lead, brandishing his sword,
 </p>
 <p>
  And the other human players supporting from behind, it instantaneously collapsed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially,
 </p>
 <p>
  =Uh, these elves… don’t they seem different from the elf Seong Jihan fought? They don’t demonstrate that absurd regeneration!
 </p>
 <p>
  =This much should be good enough!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Among the many races seen in the Chaos Battlefield, it seems elves are the weakest!
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike the absurd regeneration shown on Seong Jihan’s channel,
 </p>
 <p>
  The elves here didn’t exhibit physical abilities much different from humans.
 </p>
 <p>
  -What the? They’re nothing special!!!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Why is this so easy?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Watching Sword King feels so comfy. Did Koreans enjoy this themselves?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Non-Koreans haven’t felt that joy yet. Seong Jihan isn’t joining.
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -We haven’t experienced that yet either;
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Would’ve known if Sword King and Seong Jihan came out together.
 </p>
 <p>
  Foreign viewers continuously praised the Sword King dominating game 1.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially after always facing him as enemies, now that he was their ally, they enthusiastically enjoyed his performance.
 </p>
 <p>
  They felt at ease thinking if Seong Jihan also joined these two warriors pulling humanity forward, there would be no worries even at the Space League.
 </p>
 <p>
  And so,
 </p>
 <p>
  [1st Game Ends]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Humanity Wins]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Sword King, Yoon Sejin has been selected as the MVP for 1st Game.]
 </p>
 <p>
  In the opening match’s 1st game, humanity easily achieved victory.
 </p>
 <p>
  The MVP award went to Sword King for devastating the enemy base.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having perfectly won the first game, The commentators spoke in more relaxed tones compared to the start.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Humanity has secured the first win of the opening match!
 </p>
 <p>
  =In these games, the first set is critical! World Tree Elves passed their cards. I wonder how they’ll come out in the next game?
 </p>
 <p>
  =Shouldn’t they draw cards next? If we win the 2nd and 3rd game as well, they’ll have wasted saving cards…
 </p>
 <p>
  However, contrary to the commentators’ predictions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We will not use cards.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With the same faint smile as before game 1, the Elven Coach declared they would not use cards.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Despite losing the first game so terribly, they still act carefree. Pretty suspicious…’
 </p>
 <p>
  While Humanity’s Coach Davis stared at the Elven Coach awkwardly,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But we still have to use cards.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He chose the same as last game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Randomly banning 3 of opponent’s top 10, and selecting Southgate map.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then.
 </p>
 <p>
  [3 players from ‘World Tree Elves – 71’s top 10 are banned.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [1st, 4th and 8th ranked players are banned. They cannot participate in the 2nd game.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have duplicated use of a specific ban card option. You cannot use this option starting the next game.]
 </p>
 <p>
  =Oh, 1st, 4th and 8th ranked players! Better bans than before!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Coach Davis, today’s your day!
 </p>
 <p>
  =It says this option cannot be used in the next game onwards but… we can still ban with different options right?
 </p>
 <p>
  =Yes. There’s also an option to ban 5 players from the top 20. If we’re lucky today, banning 5 people might be more beneficial!
 </p>
 <p>
  [The map for the 2nd game has been decided.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The 2nd game will take place on ‘Southgate’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  =Whoa, Southgate again…!
 </p>
 <p>
  =70% chance triggered twice!
 </p>
 <p>
  Humanity began the 2nd game under even better conditions than before.
 </p>
 <p>
  The game result was also one-sided.
 </p>
 <p>
  [2nd Game Ends]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Humanity Wins]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Barren has been selected as the MVP for the 2nd Game.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Since offense and defense switched with humanity as defenders in the 2nd game.
 </p>
 <p>
  American First’s guild master and world #1 ranked Mage, Barren took the MVP spot.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Barren! As expected of world #1!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Just how many spells can he cast at once?!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Truly America’s pride!
 </p>
 <p>
  The American commentator heaped praises on homegrown superstar Barren, foaming at the mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the elves pathetically crumbling, he wondered if the match would end 3:0.
 </p>
 <p>
  =At this rate, it might end 3:0!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Then I wonder who today’s MVP will be!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Since Sword King and Barren each got the MVP, it comes down to who plays better in game 3 right?
 </p>
 <p>
  While discussing so with other commentators, Christopher remembered Seong Jihan claiming he would take MVP.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This looks like it’ll clearly end 3:0 though?’
 </p>
 <p>
  He was so confident saying that so
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I bet 10,000 dollars on a whim but… looks like I lost it all huh’
 </p>
 <p>
  What did he know to make that claim?
 </p>
 <p>
  Just a guy brimming with confidence it seems.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, I’ll be getting the Akashic Page anyway.’
 </p>
 <p>
  10,000 dollars was nothing compared to an Akashic Page.
 </p>
 <p>
  Christopher decided to just brush it off as a happening.
 </p>
 <p>
  Until game 3 began,
 </p>
 <p>
  The general mood looked headed towards a 3:0 finish.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  “We will not use cards.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The cardless Elven Coach this time.
 </p>
 <p>
  [5 players from ‘World Tree Elves – 71’s top 20 are banned.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [11th, 12th, 15th, 16th and 19th ranked players are banned. They cannot participate in the 3rd game.]
 </p>
 <p>
  After humanity’s bans ended, she broke into laughter.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I wasn’t banned this time?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…..What do you mean?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The #1 survived.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pointing at herself, the Coach grinned.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hearing that, Coach Davis realized who the previously banned #1 was.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Elven Coach is their…. #1 player?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehe…. It’s the Train map. See you ingame.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  As the Coach disappeared into the light,
 </p>
 <p>
  Coach Davis’s face hardened.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I have a bad feeling about this…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite consecutive losses, the still cardless elves.
 </p>
 <p>
  And their peculiar #1 player acting as Coach…
 </p>
 <p>
  Coach Davis looked at the Elven Coach with unknown anxiety,
 </p>
 <p>
  “No….!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon unable to hide his shock.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  The Train Map.
 </p>
 <p>
  Along with Southgate, it was the game map humanity played most in representative matches.
 </p>
 <p>
  Expecting elves to excel at long range, Southgate was primarily picked until now but,
 </p>
 <p>
  After games 1 and 2, confident humanity would dominate at range too, the Train map was chosen…
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Train map is so easy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  First revealing herself ingame.
 </p>
 <p>
  Top ranked Elven Coach giggled, reaching to the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Spiritualize.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Shuu—!
 </p>
 <p>
  Then the bodies of nearby elves turned transparent.
 </p>
 <p>
  Green energy gathered above the Elf’s hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  That made some 30 elves disappear.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There, done!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Atop her hand, the green energy already took shape into one form.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Is that… a train?
 </p>
 <p>
  =Yes, the looks are very similar to the two trains currently running parallel…!
 </p>
 <p>
  What she held was a train, identical to those on the Train map.
 </p>
 <p>
  Tiny light blobs moved about atop the train.
 </p>
 <p>
  The shape closely resembled humanity’s train seen from afar.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Look forward to a more exciting map next.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As she flipped the train after speaking,
 </p>
 <p>
  Rumble…!
 </p>
 <p>
  From far away, humanity’s train
 </p>
 <p>
  Instantly flipped over.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What the, what’s this…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why did the train suddenly…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  At the overturned train,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swarms of zombies rushed over.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud, Thud…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Elven train left those humans behind as if mocking them, moving forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  So far that humanity players couldn’t even think to catch up.
 </p>
 <p>
  =This is… overturning trains…?Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  =So this is the Elven #1’s level…?
 </p>
 <p>
  =The game will end soon at this rate…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The surviving players from the overturned train tried desperately resisting the zombies somehow, but
 </p>
 <p>
  After losing the train on the Train map, that was merely a meaningless struggle.
 </p>
 <p>
  [3rd Game Ends]
 </p>
 <p>
  [World Tree Elves – 71 Wins]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Elven Coach has been selected as the MVP for the 3rd Game.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Leisurely taking the MVP after effortlessly flipping the train.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Elven Coach returned to the coaching table, faintly smiling once more.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We will not use cards.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Already the 4th time repeating the same words.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the pressure Coach Davis felt now was on a different level than before.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘We have to win the 4th game no matter what. If they use their saved cards in game 5… I don’t know what’ll happen.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Coach Davis watched the Elven Coach.
 </p>
 <p>
  When she didn’t get banned as #1, that girl came out and blew up the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  In that case.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Changing ban card.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The captain decided to pick another ban card option.
 </p>
 <p>
  [World Tree Elves – 71’s #1 player is banned. Cannot participate in the 4th game.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather than random, aimed to cut out the Elven Coach showing powerful strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  -5 bans down to 1, a bit disappointing…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Nah good choice, look what happened in the 3rd game.
 </p>
 <p>
  -For real, that Coach is mad strong. Flipping a Train in the train map? Crazy
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Getting her out should make it easier like games 1 and 2.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehe….”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing Davis’s decision, the Elven Coach let out a mocking laugh.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m not #1 though.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “….What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re so naive. How could you believe what the enemy says?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then why didn’t you participate in the 1st and 2nd games…?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I thought she couldn’t come out because she was banned in the 1st and 2nd games.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  But what she’s saying now is completely different.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, yes. We have to go through five games, after all.”
 </p>

  Chapter 190
 </p>
 <p>
  =Both sides have 4 cards each…!
 </p>
 <p>
  =After gathering 3 cards, they can definitively choose ban and select options for the 4th game.
 </p>
 <p>
  =And after gathering 4 cards, they can change game options…!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Don’t tell me the elves intended this from the start…? Gathering 4 cards until…
 </p>
 <p>
  Did they do it on purpose to change game options?
 </p>
 <p>
  -No way they planned this to force a 2-2 tie right?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -That’s only possible when you can definitively control the win/loss of every game…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -For that, the elves would need to have overwhelming skills to crush us, right?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -But if they’re so strong, why go through the hassle? They could just beat us normally.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Just what are they trying to change in options…?
 </p>
 <p>
  When viewers are confused because they don’t understand the intentions of the elves.
 </p>
 <p>
  =It’s fine! We just have to win the 4th game!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Yes, that’s right. That will do! We have strong players! It’s just that the match-up wasn’t favorable on the Train map…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The commentators tried to make the situation look favorable.
 </p>
 <p>
  If they win the 4th game, no matter if the opponent gathers 4 cards.
 </p>
 <p>
  It would end cleanly with a 3:1 victory.
 </p>
 <p>
  And
 </p>
 <p>
  =Oh, select card success!
 </p>
 <p>
  =The ‘Colosseum’ map Coach Davis chose came out again!
 </p>
 <p>
  =70% chance triggered 4 times in a row!
 </p>
 <p>
  Game 4 began well.
 </p>
 <p>
  After the traumatic experience against the Elven Coach’s power on Train map,
 </p>
 <p>
  Earth’s team picked a map allowing close range fights, which lined up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, like with the coach, some other variable could pop up but,
 </p>
 <p>
  With no intel on the opponent, humanity had no choice but to pick maps based on games 1 and 2 data.
 </p>
 <p>
  =The Colosseum map, which was frequently used as a survival map!
 </p>
 <p>
  =In the Space League, 50 human and elf warriors are summoned, engaging in a bloody battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Although other classes can participate besides warrior classes, it seems that warriors who are good at close combat will be selected due to the narrow size of the map!
 </p>
 <p>
  =As you saw in the 1st and 2nd games, elf warriors were helpless against the Sword King…!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Sword King winning this game and becoming the series MVP would be great!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Yes. It absolutely cannot go to game 5. We have to end it here!
 </p>
 <p>
  With the opponent having 4 cards, enabling option changes in 5th game.
 </p>
 <p>
  The commentators emphatically stated that they must not let the game go that far.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  [A Higher race, ‘High Elf’ joins the fight.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The difference in race is significant. Adjustments will be made…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘World Tree Elves – 71’s participation adjusted to 31 players.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “High elf….?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What? Suddenly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Race adjustment… Wasn’t that in the Chaos Battlefield?”
 </p>
 <p>
  In the Chaos Battlefield, there were point differences for each race.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, when they participated in the Space League in the main game, points were calculated for each human or elf without any race adjustments.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, the point difference at that time was thought to be adjusted only in rehearsal games.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, after 4 games, they suddenly adjusted the balance.
 </p>
 <p>
  People became more anxious about such adjustments rather than being grateful for them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just how strong are they equating to 20 people!?
 </p>
 <p>
  In the midst of such anxiety, the 4th match began.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the Colosseum map, the problematic High Elf revealed herself.
 </p>
 <p>
  With long blonde hair and a part of her bangs dyed green, she had a familiar appearance to humans.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Uh…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -That elf, the one from Seong Jihan’s channel!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Yeah during the promotion match! The one helping Seong Jihan!
 </p>
 <p>
  The High Elf who called Seong Jihan mother during his Space League Promotion Battle, died to the Constellation of the Dead Star.
 </p>
 <p>
  The opponent that appeared now looked exactly like her.
 </p>
 <p>
  “High Elf…… looks exactly the same as during the promotion battle. Do they all look like that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Bit different. Her green strands look darker right? That much should make her considerably strong….]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Enough to be worth 20 people?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Would’ve given her more than 20. 4th Game, nothing left but defeat.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel made a cold judgment of a 4th game loss.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was information that Jihan already knew.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Last life, even my brother-in-law couldn’t make her draw her swords.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Sword King who joined Japan under Shizuru’s charm,
 </p>
 <p>
  Participated in the 4th game carrying humanity’s hopes set on victory but,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Is this… all?]
 </p>
 <p>
  With that line, she retired, beating everyone with just fists.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps traumatized by this defeat.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sword King later grew enough to push High Elves back but,
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  [I didn’t want to get dirty, but I guess I have no choice.]
 </p>
 <p>
  When she drew her sword, he suffered defeat again and
 </p>
 <p>
  While panic-stricken, only screamed ‘How can this be…!’ before disappearing without a trace after that day.
 </p>
 <p>
  The World Tree’s power probably freed him of the charm.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Wonder what happened to my brother-in-law after.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan stared at the Sword King on the screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin, who still lost his vision by stabbing his own eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although he was able to bring him here in this life thanks to Seong Jihan going to Japan, in the previous life without such a ally, it would have been difficult to completely break free from Ito Shizuru’s influence
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well he didn’t appear for Japan afterwards so… He must’ve kept his distance.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If Shizuru regained control of Sword King, she would’ve fielded him as Japan representative but,
 </p>
 <p>
  Since that didn’t happen at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pondering those memories of his past life momentarily, Seong Jihan watched the game unfold.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash! Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  Players from both sides were summoned to the Colosseum.
 </p>
 <p>
  Two sides facing each other, about to confront each other.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this… all?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The High Elf at the forefront of the Elf side looked down on humans as if they were insignificant.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Inventory.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Opening her inventory, she put the sword she was holding into it.
 </p>
 <p>
  =She seems to be a High Elf, but…?
 </p>
 <p>
  =Instead of looking at us, she’s putting her weapon away. What’s her intention?
 </p>
 <p>
  When the commentators were confused about the elf’s intention.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The appearance of the High Elf disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom! Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  In an instant, the heads of human warriors exploded in midair.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah, no….
 </p>
 <p>
  =What just happened…!?
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom! Boom! Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  Human warriors continued to explode.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before they knew it, 20 had died.
 </p>
 <p>
  =No way… it hasn’t even been 10 seconds, what is going on!?
 </p>
 <p>
  =I…Is the game over already…!?
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like the game would end instantly like this.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  “…Fast.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sword King’s twin swords flew automatically and blocked the High Elf’s fist for the first time.
 </p>
 <p>
  “At least this is better.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, with a sly smile on her lips, the High Elf said, “I’ll use my feet too,” and unleashed a barrage of kicks, not just punches, overwhelmingly overwhelming the Sword King.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom! Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  Casually exploding the surrounding human warriors as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sword King, who was now the last one standing, resisted to the end.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Goodbye.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  In the end, unable to withstand the relentless assault, the twin swords shattered, and the head of the Sword King also exploded.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah…
 </p>
 <p>
  =T-The Sword King has fallen too…!
 </p>
 <p>
  [Game 4 has ended.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘World Tree Elves – 71’ wins.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘High Elf 71′ has been selected as the MVP for 4th Game.]
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  The 4th Game didn’t even last 10 minutes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Here comes the 5th game.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Elven Coach standing across from the coaches’ tables smiled radiantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That player… isn’t 1st place either?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile on the other side, Coach Davis murmured with a dumbfounded expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  This game was a battle fought with the opponents’ 1st place banned.
 </p>
 <p>
  A player like that isn’t 1st place among World Tree Elves?
 </p>
 <p>
  “High Elf-nim? You fight exceptionally well. It’s just that you’re not first.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s that…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Rank and strength don’t always go hand in hand.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Why did you drag the game out until the 4th round?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Coach Davis asked with a dark expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “With a player that strong, the game could have ended in just 3 rounds.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, of course.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Elven coach pulled out four cards in both hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  “To use the cards.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…For changing options?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehe…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Entering the preparation stage for the 5th game.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [This is the last match. No ban or select cards will be given.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Cards gathered until now may be used.]
 </p>
 <p>
  In the 5th game, with no ban or select cards provided, the last game where they could utilize the cards they had collected.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Elven coach placed the cards on the table for the first time in this game.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll use four ban cards to change the game option… I’ll change the ‘Defeat Penalty.'”
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  “…What!?”
 </p>
 <p>
  A defeat penalty? Can such a thing be changed?
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll add ‘death’ for the defeat penalty of the representative team players.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “De… Death…”
 </p>
 <p>
  To an unexpected penalty, not only Coach Davis but also…
 </p>
 <p>
  “What… Death!?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No way… dying for losing games!?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What game kills you for losing!?”
 </p>
 <p>
  All the players in the national team waiting room were shocked.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just a while ago, they were talking about being selected for the Space League Earth representative team for the first time, an honor for their family, but now…
 </p>
 <p>
  “SHIT! No freaking way!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just from gathering 4 cards…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I, I don’t wanna die…… After coming this far….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, I shouldn’t have joined the representative team…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Now completely panic-stricken, greatly regretting becoming Earth representatives.
 </p>
 <p>
  But amidst humanity’s chaos,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Elven Coach simply proceeded with tasks at hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Death rate set to maximum.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The highest penalty in the Bronze League is 1/10 type. Will you proceed with this?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The losing team will face a 1/10 penalty. One random member out of ten will be executed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  When the 1/10 penalty was mentioned, there was a brief moment of confusion.
 </p>
 <p>
  “One-tenth… So, only one out of ten…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, not everyone is going to die…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Still, one out of ten… If you’re unlucky, it’s still a death sentence!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the shock, everyone was dumbfounded at the penalty where 200 out of 2000 would be executed. However, the Elven coach still had four unused cards.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Also, I will use select cards to choose the game map as ‘Heavenly Elysia’.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Heavenly Elysia’ map has special settings.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Would you like to load all the settings?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’ll need four Select cards].Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers could also see the choices made by the Elven coach and the system. People were anxious about the meaning of needing four cards for ‘Heavenly Elysia’ and its settings.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah…!
 </p>
 <p>
  =This map…! It has a double penalty effect for the game…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The commentators, the first to grasp the characteristics of the map, shouted in agony.
 </p>
 <p>
  A double penalty meant that instead of 10%, 20% would be executed. The other map settings were also absurd.
 </p>
 <p>
  =In Heavenly Elysia, where the sapling of the World Tree is… the power of the spirits is greatly amplified…
 </p>
 <p>
  =I-isn’t this map completely advantageous for the elves!
 </p>
 <p>
  Unilaterally strengthening only the elves through map settings. It was clear why four select cards were necessary.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well for your humanity, doesn’t seem you need to but,”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Elven Coach slightly lifted her mouth corners.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is how we deal with newbies. Die obediently please.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh…. Ugh….”
 </p>
 <p>
  Coach Davis was in despair. He thought that the BattleNet after entering the Space League wouldn’t be as peaceful as before. However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘As soon as we enter the Space League… 20% execution.’
 </p>
 <p>
  This is how elves deal with newbies?
 </p>
 <p>
  It gave him chills.
 </p>
 <p>
  Space League… It seemed more like a war than a game.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Everything… favors the elves….’
 </p>
 <p>
  While Coach Davis was looking down at the loaded settings with a dismayed expression,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Huh?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the last item, he widened his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Heavenly Elysia entry requirements]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Only Platinum ranked Support classes may participate.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Platinum Support.
 </p>
 <p>
  A person perfectly fitting this item was…
 </p>
 <p>
  As if it were a lie, there was exactly one person on the representative team.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is this condition about…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Platinum, support? There are races in the universe that aren’t as weak as humans. To prevent the worst-case scenario, we’ve set the optimal conditions.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the Heavenly Elysia map was designed to favor elves, the Space League was filled with unpredictable powerful races.
 </p>
 <p>
  Therefore, the map designer, to prevent a losing situation, restricted the players who could participate in the Heavenly Elysia map to Platinum players with the support class.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well an unnecessary condition for your opponent but, bring them quickly. The Platinum Support.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha… Hahah….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah right, he’s not on the team. He’ll be randomly selected from the reserves, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  At the Coach’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  Coach Davis chuckled as if he had given up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Heh, heh… Not on the team… Who could it be?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  What’s with the attitude change?
 </p>
 <p>
  While the attitude of Coach Davis changed, the Elven Coach felt a bit uneasy.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is he crazy?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Dismissing it as trivial, they proceeded with the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  And so the game began, Heavenly Elysia.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as the game started, the entire body of the opposing elf exploded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hurry up and revive, elf.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At the hands of a man wielding a spear and sword.

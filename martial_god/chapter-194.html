  Chapter 194
 </p>
 <p>
  Tied for first place in the Space League.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the 20 planets participating in the league, 10 teams tied for first place, and 10 teams tied for last place, but the effects were significant.
 </p>
 <p>
  [As you are ranked highly in the league, your GP exchange rate will be preferred.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The price of GP exchanged in BattleNet also dropped.
 </p>
 <p>
  [A large number of dungeon portals that were summoned have now disappeared. Dungeons will only generate in the bottom 5 percent of countries.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The dungeon portals that generated in the bottom 10 percent of countries were drastically reduced to 5 percent.
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, out of the approximately 200 countries on Earth, dungeons would only spawn in 10, making them easier to manage than even during the tutorial.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow… is this the effect of being 1st place?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Crazy!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Seong Jihan saved a lot, really.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since there was still a while until the next Space League match, humanity could enjoy this merit for being in joint 1st place for quite some time.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, just as people were briefly enjoying this celebratory atmosphere,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Space League points will now be calculated daily.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [League points can be obtained not only through official league matches but also through BattleNet games.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The league will expand. A Master League and Grand Master League will be created above the Diamond League.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Changes occurred in BattleNet again through the BattleNet notifications that appeared a day later.
 </p>
 <p>
  The points determining the Space League ranking are not only from official league matches but also from the performance of players in regular BattleNet games.
 </p>
 <p>
  Consequently, human rankings changed immediately.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Humanity drops from joint 1st to 8th place. World Tree Elves – 71 shoots up to 11th place in one go.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [“The elf execution was actually beneficial!” Coach Davis, who was scolded for giving up tremendous profits and enforcing execution, insists he was right after seeing league changes.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dungeon portal range changes back to 10 percent of countries. However, disappeared dungeon portals do not respawn.]
 </p>
 <p>
  -Damn, did the elves earn the most points out of the 10 races that lost the opening match?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Yep, they earned 202 points by themselves. We earned around 100 a day lol
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -But we can earn 10k points just by winning league matches. The point difference is still big though…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Don’t the daily points add up eventually?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Is Coach Davis right? Lol
 </p>
 <p>
  “If they didn’t get executed yesterday, the elves would’ve earned more points.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right, it was a good decision to kill them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In the penthouse living room, Yoon Seah muttered while looking at the points revealed in the Space League ranking. The daily 500-point league point was quite substantial. Only six planets gained more than 200 points.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ?? marked 1st-5th ranked planets and the 11th ranked World Tree Elves – 71.
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering the other races hadn’t even exceeded 150 points daily at most, it clearly showed how strong the World Tree elves were.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, Seong Jihan reminisced as he looked at the points.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The races in 1st-5th place should be elves from the World Tree Alliance and the dragons… Their point acquisition is different than before.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In the previous life, the Elves in the World Elf Alliance gained at least 240 points. Later, when players advanced to the Master League and Grand Master League, daily point acquisition reached nearly 500. If the daily points that humans barely obtained in the last moment were 200, it was a huge difference.
 </p>
 <p>
  That was why people were self-deprecating about not earning as many points as the elves after the opening match.
 </p>
 <p>
  But for that figure to drop across the board…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Could it be related to the fact that the Elves were executed?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Since World Tree Elves – 71 took such a big hit to their fighting force, did the 5 planets rearrange their players?
 </p>
 <p>
  He didn’t know the exact reasons yet but Seong Jihan judged this would have quite the impact later on.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though the point difference is currently only a few tens, it will become significantly larger during the final league settlement.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle, what exactly are Constellations? Did you see anything about them in your visions?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah asked, tilting her head while looking at the newly added Constellation slot after the tutorial.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel, who was watching TV on the sofa, answered in place of Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Constellations are the rulers recognized by BattleNet of their planets. Precisely, they are players who have reached Level 777.”
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  “So they’re BattleNet seniors?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seniors… You could see it that way too… Anyway, Constellations sponsor players according to their own purposes. They mainly sponsor players with potential, aiming to benefit themselves as well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really? Hmm… Why doesn’t it sponsor me? I’m also someone with potential.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was so dominant last year, and Yoon Seah’s growth was remarkable enough to confidently claim to have potential. However…Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t your Gift still a low rank?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, it’s C-rank. I have to meet the ‘right’ Constellation to upgrade it to rank B.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The upgrade conditions for Latent Constellation opened after the tutorial ended.
 </p>
 <p>
  She had to receive a Constellation’s sponsorship to upgrade to B.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Constellations don’t know everything. They probably judge based on the player’s Gift rank. If it’s C-rank, they probably won’t show any interest.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… Really? Damn it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah made a troubled expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  Constellations picked sponsorship targets just by looking at Gift ranks.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seah, who was still C-rank, was filtered out right away.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If sponsor Constellations keep not appearing, I’ll talk to the Shadow Queen.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, really? Is this what getting a job through connections is like!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t get your hopes up too much. I’m also just at the level of making suggestions to the Queen.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Still, it’s better than getting cut right away before even submitting my resume. Do you have a Constellation, Uncle?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Me? I do. Brahma”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow… The Brahma from Divine Constellations? So that god was a player too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, Constellations don’t necessarily have to be players. Reaching Level 777 to become a Constellation is just one method.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so? The universe really is wide…”
 </p>
 <p>
  While Yoon Seah and Ariel were talking about Constellations,
 </p>
 <p>
  Beep! Beep!
 </p>
 <p>
  The doorbell rang outside the living room and Yoon Sejin entered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having finished the meeting with the exploration team of the BattleNet Association to resume dungeon exploration after the opening match, he approached Seong Jihan with a serious expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Brother-in-law… Can you help me out a bit?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s the matter?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “With the victory in the opening match, the dungeon portals in North Korea have disappeared on a large scale. As a result, the Abyss, which draws power from the dungeon portals, has also weakened… ”
 </p>
 <p>
  The dungeon portals, forming the upper-level dungeons, Abyss, were originally planned to be gradually cleared by Yoon Sejin while reducing the power of the Abyss. However, due to the victory of humanity in the opening match, the plan was expedited.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then can’t we just explore the Abyss directly now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, it’s too early for that. It seems like we should first eliminate the four giant dungeon portals around the Abyss. However, the exploration team says they need more power, and they are hesitant to proceed with the exploration immediately.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wouldn’t just having brother-in-law in the exploration team be enough in terms of manpower?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems like they’re cautious, probably because it’s the first time entering the giant dungeon portals…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Summoned from all directions around the Abyss, these giant dungeon portals remained large in scale even after the victory in the opening match. While clearing dungeon portals had been relatively easy until now, the size difference in this case made the Association exploration team adopt a more cautious approach.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood. I’ll join as well then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh… Are you sure it’s okay?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. It’s my sister’s matter, so it’s only natural. Besides, I’ve also reached the maximum level.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After winning five games in the opening match, Seong Jihan reached level 200. Now, until the January promotion match, he couldn’t level up further. He had some time to spare, and Seong Jihan decided to assist the Sword King in finding his sister.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll join right away.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Dad… I’m also in Platinum now. Can I participate too?”
 </p>
 <p>
  While Yoon Seah showed interest in the dungeon exploration to find her mother, Seong Jihan had reservations.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We don’t know what might happen in the dungeon portal. It would be better if you waited at home. You should focus on leveling up quietly. I’ll be back soon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right. You need to be at least Diamond for a solo run. Just stay at home and level up. We’ll be back shortly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Yoon Seah had considerable skill, given the uncertainty of what might emerge from the giant dungeon portal, it was essential to minimize potential risks.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay… I understand.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Disappointed, she nodded as if reluctantly accepting their decision. Despite her desire to find her mother, she wasn’t a child throwing a tantrum.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, I’ll be going then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, take care~”
 </p>
 <p>
  Three days later, Seong Jihan joined the exploration team.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Seong Jihan joins the exploration team! Says he’ll devote himself to dungeon exploration until the promotion match!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The exploration team challenges the giant dungeon portals for the first time with enhanced forces. Will the North Korean land finally be liberated?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Everyone’s attention focused on the exploration team’s endeavor, challenging giant dungeon portals for the first time in the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  The dungeon exploration itself progressed smoothly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “With player Seong Jihan joining, it was instant.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “It feels more like we came on an excursion than a dungeon. Hahaha.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Association exploration team that was worried about what might appear from the huge dungeon portal.
 </p>
 <p>
  After entering, it was true that more powerful monsters than regular dungeon portals occasionally popped out, but
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  A sword stabbed into the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nameless Divine Skill, Annihilation God’s Secret – Myriad Ghosts Sealing Gods
 </p>
 <p>
  As Myriad Ghosts Sealing Gods revealed its pattern, the ghost monsters that made up most of the enemies got sucked into it in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ooh… All the ghosts are vanishing!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “To be able to watch Player Seong Jihan in action up close like this… I’m glad I joined the exploration team!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even before this, Seong Jihan was already a globally notable player.
 </p>
 <p>
  But after leading humanity to victory in the opening match against the elves, his standing rose another level.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since he completely turned around the situation when 20 percent were about to face execution.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now it wasn’t just the general public, BattleNet officials and players were saying they were Seong Jihan’s avid fans.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The crimson lightning is coming out too…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We have to record this!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Snap! Snap!
 </p>
 <p>
  Phone cameras flashed from all directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan knit his brows at how they were just taking pictures instead of investigating like the exploration team was supposed to do.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Excuse me. When will we look for the dungeon core?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, well, that’s…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We still haven’t located it yet. Haha.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It still hasn’t been found? What’s the gift rank?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s B.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A Support Gift, Exploration, at rank B should have decent effects even for regular dungeon portals.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed to have no effect at all for massive dungeon portals.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The problem is probably the rank. Christopher needs to join quickly.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Christopher, the commentator from Channel 0.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having hit big thanks to Seong Jihan this time, he said he would repay the favor and immediately went on long-term leave, boarding a plane for Korea.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, he seems to be bringing baggage too… It’s not as dangerous here as I thought.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish! Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sword King’s white sword freely roamed the dungeon, skewering ghosts on it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aaah…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The enemies turned into smoke and disappeared in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  Honestly, with the Sword king alone, the giant dungeon seemed manageable in terms of firepower.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the issue was exploration.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Since it’s clear that a B-rank gift isn’t enough, let’s withdraw.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood….”
 </p>
 <p>
  After three days without successful exploration of the dungeon core, the giant dungeon portal remained intact.
 </p>
 <p>
  On that evening,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong! I’m here! Um, I’m sorry but…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jihan! I came too~!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sophia insisted on coming too so I brought her along…… Is it safe here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s safe.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The situation changed once Christopher’s group joined.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It should be here!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Christopher’s exploration, which was effective even in the giant dungeon portal, quickly revealed the dungeon core, making the three days of struggle seem insignificant.
 </p>
 <p>
  After breaking the dungeon core:
 </p>
 <p>
  Bwoooong…!
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, the ring…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin’s ring vibrated intensely.
 </p>
 <p>
  The void aura Yoon Seah sensed before completely shrouded the ring.
 </p>
 <p>
  And from within that.
 </p>
 <p>
  A familiar voice, his sister’s voice he knew well
 </p>
 <p>
  =Yoon Sejin… I will curse you…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The voice sounded so eerie that it sent shivers down his spine.

  Chapter 195
 </p>
 <p>
  “Curse, huh…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  At the end of the North Korean dungeon exploration, hearing Seong Jiah’s voice was an achievement, but the content it contained was unexpected.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Noona is not the type to say such things…….’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jiah, with her gentle nature, used to advise Seong Jihan to go out and be active.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  Her usual tone was kind and gentle, not that of someone who would curse like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  Why did she specifically mention Yoon Sejin?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, at least she’s alive. Thank goodness.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin touched the ring hanging around his neck, and smiled faintly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The North Korean exploration had begun without much expectation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether it was cursing or swearing, there was a meaningful trace of Seong Jiah, so it turned out fine.
 </p>
 <p>
  “As we continue exploring the other giant dungeons, we might find more.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Christopher, can we go to another one today?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course! But what did she say to shock you so much?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “She said she will curse my brother-in-law.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah…… curse, huh. Perhaps she knows about you having been to Japan?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  If she knew that he had crossed over to Shizuru’s side, shouldn’t she also know about his return now?
 </p>
 <p>
  Given Seong Jiah’s nature, if she knew Yoon Sejin had been enchanted only to come back with his eyes gouged out by her.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead of cursing him for crossing over, she would likely worry about how his eyes were and how he had been through hard times.
 </p>
 <p>
  “For now, it seems like we have to continue the exploration to know more.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. Let’s keep going.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. I should call Seah too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah as well…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Dungeons are not that dangerous anyway, and Seah can discern the power of the void.”
 </p>
 <p>
  By Seong Jihan and Yoon Sejin, the giant dungeon portal was swept away more easily than expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  Maybe it’d be more dangerous in other dungeons than here.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘We have to focus here now that we have a solid clue.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as Seong Jihan came out of the dungeon, he called Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah, come to the dungeon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [What? Really? Can I come?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. It’s less dangerous than we thought. Come with Akari. There’s something you need to discern too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Why? What happened?]
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan explained what had happened a little while ago, Yoon Seah was surprised.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Wow… Mom said that to Dad? I can’t imagine it.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “But brother-in-law is glad she’s alive.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hm… That’s right. She must know something to curse him, right? Ugh. I’m curious. I should come check it out quickly! Akari unnie! Let’s get ready!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. I’ll send the car, come quickly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After calling Yoon Seah,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then let’s go to the next dungeon quickly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright.”
 </p>
 <p>
  They started to explore the second giant dungeon portal.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the large van headed towards the second massive dungeon portal an hour away,
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia, who was in the same large van as Seong Jihan, kept staring at his face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sophia, stop staring. It might make Seong Jihan uncomfortable.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why, Oppa? I like looking at him. Jihan, are you uncomfortable?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, I’m used to it now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……Haa. Seong Jihan already has a partner!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Chris, she’s just looking, why nag?”
 </p>
 <p>
  She wasn’t usually like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  Christopher shook his head with a tired expression and changed the topic.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Player Seong Jihan. Was your exploration in North Korea related to the Priestess Seong Jiah?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, that’s right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… I wondered why the Sword King was exploring North Korea.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Priestess class was only Sophia and Ms. Jiah. It’s really sad she disappeared. I had many things I wanted to ask her”
 </p>
 <p>
  The special support class, Priestess.
 </p>
 <p>
  Humanity had only two players with that class: Seong Jiah and Sophia.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Priestess class can use divine power more deeply compared to existing support classes, and their buff effects are heightened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But I still don’t get what ‘using divine power more deeply’ means… That was the first thing I wanted to ask Ms. Jiah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought about his previous life.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that time, Sophia couldn’t find a clue about this either.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Jihan, did you hear anything from Ms. Jiah about using divine power?
 </p>
 <p>
  She used to ask him repeatedly if he remembered anything.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the end, even up to the moment of apocalypse, Sophia couldn’t fully utilize the Priestess class.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If we find noona, you can ask her.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, Let’s find her!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, and Mr. Christopher. Here’s what I promised.”
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">

 <p>
  Seong Jihan handed over the Akashic page confiscated from Shizuru to Christopher.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh…! You’re giving it already?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was going to give it to you anyway. Let’s end the dungeon exploration quickly with the help of your exploration gift.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha… As expected, you are very generous. Th-then I will gratefully accept without hesitation…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks to Seong Jihan, he hit big at the start of the year.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, with the Akashic page worth a tremendous value, Christopher enhanced his abilities.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow… S-rank exploration! My abilities have increased so easily!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Since it’s S-rank now, let’s finish the North Korean business while you’re in Korea.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sure! Let’s conquer the Abyss too!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Christopher, who became the world’s top explorer with the help of Akashic page, bragged about conquering even the Abyss.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just exploring and not participating… Anyone would think you’re clearing dungeons alone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, this is such an important mission!”
 </p>
 <p>
  While the Christopher siblings bickered, Seong Jihan chuckled watching them.
 </p>
 <p>
  They are so different from me and noona.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘My noona took care of everything for me….’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jiah, who was 10 years older than Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  After their parents passed away, she gave up college preparations and took on the role of a responsible young head of the family.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking back now, even my noona must have been greatly shocked then.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite that, she took charge of life bravely without showing any signs of weakness in front of me.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…As my brother-in-law said, her being alive is all that matters.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether she curses Yoon Sejin or not.
 </p>
 <p>
  The fact that noona is alive.
 </p>
 <p>
  That fact itself was important.
 </p>
 <p>
  Screech!
 </p>
 <p>
  The van carrying the group stopped, and the second giant dungeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, Mr. Seong Jihan. I can feel it already. Right from the entrance, I feel the dungeon core!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Christopher, who had enhanced abilities to S-rank, found the dungeon core much faster than before.
 </p>
 <p>
  And…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, and… there’s something on the ground, too? It didn’t feel like this when it was A-rank.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Here, right here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Christopher, now S-rank, captured another clue in the giant dungeon portal.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the ground he pointed to, a translucent dungeon core was cunningly hidden.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This… might have also been in the previous giant dungeon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We should make a round of the other giant dungeons and check if so.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. It’d be problematic if civilians think that the dungeon is cleared, and it pops up again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As he found all the dungeon cores,
 </p>
 <p>
  “That person, isn’t that Christopher, the commentator?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Eh, but… Could he have an exploration gift? He’s finding dungeon cores.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The one who found the giant dungeon earlier was him too. It seems he has at least a B-rank gift.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow… the commentator Christopher is a player too. This is totally exclusive news!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Christopher, known worldwide as a commentator on Channel 0.
 </p>
 <p>
  The BattleNet exploration team buzzed with excitement upon recognizing him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Haha, well, fame can’t be helped! Come on. I’m Christopher, the world’s best explorer!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mr. Commentator, please give me your autograph!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course, I’ll give you one! Come here!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether he made the decision to come out as an exploration expert this time, Christopher blatantly revealed himself to the exploration team members.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Haa… Jihan, I’m sorry. My brother’s a bit of an attention-seeker.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a S-rank gift, he has a right to be excited. Just do your job well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, I’ll closely monitor him!”
 </p>
 <p>
  And as Sophia headed towards Christopher,
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin looked at the dungeon core he found, nodding in satisfaction.
 </p>
 <p>
  “S-rank exploration gift, what an impressive ability…This will be over soon. Should we break the dungeon core?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah will arrive in about an hour. It’s better to break it after she comes. Using the power of the Void, we might gather more information.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If it’s an hour… That might be better. We need to secure the area.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, let’s get things organized.”
 </p>
 <p>
  To make sure nothing goes wrong. Seong Jihan and Yoon Sejin completely swept away the monsters that came out of the dungeon and waited for a while.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle! Dad! I’m here!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, accompanied by Akari, rushed over.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where… what do I look for?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait a moment. Let’s break the dungeon cores first.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack!
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin, with the necklace, destroyed both dungeon cores, and…
 </p>
 <p>
  [All dungeon cores of the giant dungeon are destroyed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Based on your contribution to dungeon subjugation, the maximum level limit is increased by 1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A system message that Seong Jihan hadn’t seen before appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hoo… Is this the merit of dungeon subjugation?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I merely fought monsters because it seemed only Yoon Sejin with the necklace should break the dungeon cores.
 </p>
 <p>
  The system recognized that as a contribution, increasing the level limit by 1.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘When the level limit is filled later, I should keep doing dungeon subjugation.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan planned for the future,
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Brrrrr…!Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin’s ring vibrated again, attracting attention.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ring then turned completely purple.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah, try it like last time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Yoon Seah summoned the Void Arrow again,
 </p>
 <p>
  The ring and arrow resonated, and purple light spread in all directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  And…
 </p>
 <p>
  Uuuuh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The view before them started to change completely.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is this… an illusion?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The world, now immersed in purple, had completely changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan soon realized this was a type of illusion.
 </p>
 <p>
  As if being possessed,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan could only observe, while the entity with whom he shared vision moved independently.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s easy to break the illusion but…’
 </p>
 <p>
  He could return to the real world if he wanted to, even now.
 </p>
 <p>
  The clue to find Jiah for Seong Jihan meant maintaining the possessed state for now.
 </p>
 <p>
  If anything seems off, I’ll just drop out immediately.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But here… is it a hospital?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The scene he observed through the possessed subject was similar to a large hospital room.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But… it feels familiar.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was seized by a strange sense of déjà vu while looking at the hospital room.
 </p>
 <p>
  I feel like I’ve been here before.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  A familiar voice flowed from the mouth of the possessed subject.
 </p>
 <p>
  And someone suddenly popped their face next to him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah, are you okay?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…It’s me?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan with deep dark circles and a haggard face unlike now.
 </p>
 <p>
  He looked at the possessed subject with an extremely worried face.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan knew where this was when he saw that face.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…The hospital where Seah attempted suicide.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The hospital where Yoon Seah attempted suicide after the attack from the Sword King fanclub.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the previous life, it was a place filled with memories that tormented Seong Jihan the most.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Could you please bring a mirror?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Sure.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The hand mirror shown by Seong Jihan revealed a face tightly wrapped in bandages.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Will it….. recover?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry. I’m diligently looking for a capable support. I’ll turn you back to your old face.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t think there’s anyone who can heal me….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Money can solve anything. Seah, don’t worry, Uncle hit the jackpot.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You always say you hit big…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pfft.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Yoon Seah let out a disappointed laugh, the vibration spread from Seong Jihan’s pants pocket.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, Seah, I’ll be back in a sec.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, go do your work…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, having apparently answered a call, hurriedly left the room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah watched him leave the room and sighed softly, then got up.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Ah, could it be…that time…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan felt a sinking feeling as he watched this series of events.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the time when he received an urgent call about a loan and rushed out.
 </p>
 <p>
  The most regretful moment from his previous life.
 </p>
 <p>
  Could it be… this is seen from Yoon Seah’s perspective?
 </p>
 <p>
  Why would this… in the void…
 </p>
 <p>
  Then
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha, did you think I would die like this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah bit her lip as she looked at herself in the mirror.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite being terrorized and having her face torn apart…
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll succeed somehow.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Her will was unwavering.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…What… So the suicide doesn’t happen here?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Yeah. In a way, this seemed normal.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah’s determination was never weak.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan watched the illusion…
 </p>
 <p>
  “You can’t do that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Hissss…
 </p>
 <p>
  A vague Korean voice was heard from behind Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You must die here.”
 </p>

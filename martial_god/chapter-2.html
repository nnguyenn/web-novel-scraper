  <strong>
   Chapter 2
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  On a certain day in the year 2010.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Inviting Earthlings to the Battle Net.
 </p>
 <p>
  A single invitation from space turned the human way of life upside down.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you watch the game yesterday?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I did. We won against Mexico pretty easily.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Sword King swept everyone. Their tanks are weak against us.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Battle Net League unfolds worldwide. A combat game consisting of these four modes: Survival, Invasion, Defense, and Dungeons.
 </p>
 <p>
  It made all professional sports like the Olympics and World Cup disappear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kids in Brazilian alleys, once playing soccer, began to treat swords as toys.
 </p>
 <p>
  Promising members of American baseball teams threw daggers instead of baseballs in the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  It had been just a year since Earth was invited to Battle Net, and yet such a peculiar shift in perception had occurred.
 </p>
 <p>
  And now, after a decade, in the year 2020.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The tutorial season of Battle Net will end after this year.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Starting from 2021, humanity will participate in the Space League – Bronze League.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The time for humanity to stay in the cradle had come to an end.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  A vast and splendid living room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, lying on the sofa, opened his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Where is this…’
 </p>
 <p>
  His head throbbed with pain, and the smell of alcohol vibrated in his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Typical hangover symptoms.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was an experience Seong Jihan hadn’t had a single time for the past few years. But he was so pleased with this feeling.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I really have returned to the early days of the league.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A chance to challenge the system again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even when he saw the last system message, he didn’t believe he would actually return.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had truly gone back in time.
 </p>
 <p>
  He quickly got up from the sofa and looked around. A spacious living room big enough to kick a ball around. It was a very familiar place to him.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was his sister’s house and Yoon Sejin’s house.
 </p>
 <p>
  Until now, Seong Jihan had been living in this house.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘And…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even the numerous bottles of alcohol on the coffee table in front of the sofa.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That’s right..’nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, It was a period of upheaval in his life, the time when he had become a Level 2 and participated in the Bronze League for the first time.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now once again, let’s listen to the press conference of the Sword King Yoon Sejin…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, a somber voice was spreading from the TV.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan turned his gaze in that direction, a video of a journalist conference with a man was playing on the TV, filling the entire wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ladies and gentlemen of the nation.
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as Seong Jihan heard that voice, he clenched his teeth.
 </p>
 <p>
  That journalist conference video.
 </p>
 <p>
  A scene he couldn’t forget for a lifetime.
 </p>
 <p>
  July 31st, 2020…
 </p>
 <p>
  He even remembered the date perfectly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I, Yoon Sejin….
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sword King Yoon Sejinwas Seong Jihan’s brother-in-law and the strongest player in Korea.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ranked 3rd among the world’s top 11 players, he was known to be the most powerful among the Warrior class.
 </p>
 <p>
  He, who was called Korea’s pride and national treasure. On the screen, he stood with a proud expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Regarding the rumors circulating across space, I’ve come today to reveal the truth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Confidently, he continued speaking.
 </p>
 <p>
  “First, about the rumor of me transfering to Japan’s Divine Self-Defense Force.
 </p>
 <p>
  That part is true.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Of all times, just as I return to the past, to see that bastard’s face again.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin’s press conference.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was the turning point that shook Korea and led to its downfall.
 </p>
 <p>
  Him moving to Japan had a cascading effect, causing Korea’s league ranking to plummet rapidly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “And our country… perished.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan twisted his expression while contemplating future events.
 </p>
 <p>
  The journalists on the screen, momentarily wearing disappointed looks, eagerly raised their hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mr. Yoon Sejin! Mr. Yoon Sejin!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Defecting to Japan’s Divine Self-Defense Force? Is that really true?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It is true.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Divine Self-Defense Force is a guild directly under the Japanese government! It’s known to select representatives for the league nations, and they only accept Japanese nationals.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, then…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m aware of that too. The Divine Self-Defense Force only accepts Japanese people.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Click. Click. Click.
 </p>
 <p>
  The press conference hall was enveloped in silence.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sound of camera flashes continued to reverberate.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, I, Sejin… am changing my name to Ryuhei and naturalize as a Japanese citizen. Please call him Ito Ryuhei from now on.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Murmurs. Murmurs.
 </p>
 <p>
  The unsettled voices of journalists reached beyond the TV screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  “W-what?! Mr. Yoon Sejin!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you saying… Sword King!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Becoming a naturalized Japanese citizen!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you saying you’re retiring as a national representative too?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. I, Ito Ryuhei, will be representing Japan in the World Champions League from now on. See you then. Well then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even a cool smile circled around Yoon Sejin’s lips as he spoke of becoming Japanese.
 </p>
 <p>
  Countless journalists had such cold expressions that it seemed as if their emotions froze.
 </p>
 <p>
  He, who had been called Korea’s hero and gained popularity with his gentle image, now appeared completely contrary to that image.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait, wait a moment!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mr. Yoon Sejin! Has there been any consultation with the Korean government?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “To change even your name…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Journalists rushed towards Yoon Sejin, but suddenly, a black shadow rippled around him, and he was engulfed in it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What… what is this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where did he go?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  And the screen shifted.
 </p>
 <p>
  Below the scene of a gloomy discussion hall, a bold headline was written.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Sword King’s Departure. What will happen to South Korea’s league ranking in the future?]

   “Well, even watching it again… it’s quite… bewildering. It was a story that hadn’t been discussed in advance by the government, right?”
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   “Yes. The government’s stance is that they will calmly persuade Mr. Yoon Sejin, but his current whereabouts are uncertain.”

   “Sword King going to Japan of all places…”

   A moment of lamentation for Sword King’s departure.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   A panel of BattleNet experts began discussing the future.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   “The best outcome would be for the Sword King to return to South Korea…”
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   “Even if he doesn’t return, our league ranking should remain stable.”

 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   “The East Asia League is so competitive that our immediate ranking might drop, but overall, we’ll still be among the top nations.”
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   “That’s right. ‘Dungeons’ tend to emerge from the bottom 10% of nations.”
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   “Hmph.”
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   Upon hearing the phrase ‘bottom 10%’, Seong Jihan snorted.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   “They are still running their happiness circuits.”
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   The significance of Battle Net’s league rankings was that they were directly linked to a nation’s security.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   “Once dungeons start appearing, It’s over, Look at North Korea.”
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   More accurately, it was due to the phenomenon of dungeons, previously seen only in Battle Net games, manifesting in reality.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   And the country that directly faced the consequences of this dungeon phenomenon was North Korea.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   Concerned about its impact on their regime, North Korea banned player cultivation and boycotted participation in Battle Net altogether.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   As a result, North Korea, which eventually became overwhelmingly at the bottom of the league rankings, was devastated by dungeons appearing across its territory.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   “But still, South Korea is maintaining its position within the top 20.”
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   “That’s right! Even without Sword King, we won’t drop below the top 30.”
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   “Actually, Japan might be the one that paid an unreasonable price to persuade the Sword King. This will ultimately backfire on them.”
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   It’s okay. We can survive.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   In fact, it’s Japan that suffered losses.

   Hearing the victory in the panelists’ voices, Seong Jihan turned off the TV in annoyance.

   If his talents were considered without personal ethics, they were unparalleled.

 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   Of course, the price Japan paid was undoubtedly significant.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   At the time, there were criticisms about why they would burden themselves with acquiring just one player.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   “But in less than three years, that evaluation completely turned around.”
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   After Earth’s tutorial ended and the world plunged into chaos, the acquisition of the Sword King became known as a divine intervention.

   “But…”

   His sister and young nephew.

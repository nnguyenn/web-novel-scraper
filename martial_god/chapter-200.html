  Chapter 200
 </p>
 <p>
  =The League Competition begins.
 </p>
 <p>
  Channel 0, focused mainly on the human waiting room and Seong Jihan,
 </p>
 <p>
  As the game started, the screen moved to the battlefield where the main game was taking place.
 </p>
 <p>
  =The game format of the competition primarily focuses on defense.
 </p>
 <p>
  =The TOP 100 participating in the Diamond Promotion Match will work together to stop the monsters swarming each battlefield.
 </p>
 <p>
  =The scores for each race are determined by who stops the waves faster and how many survivors there are.
 </p>
 <p>
  =If our team suppresses the monster waves faster, we can select the opposing team and send additional monsters to them.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was the first League Competition experienced by humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  The game format was simple.
 </p>
 <p>
  The TOP 100 gathered together to suppress monster waves and survive as much as possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  And when there was room, quickly destroy waves and summon more monsters into the enemy camp to compete for rankings.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The format itself is simple, but… there are various strategies for each assigned map.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recalled his past memories.
 </p>
 <p>
  While humans played the game straightforwardly according to given conditions, the World Tree Elves swiftly dominated maps and troubled the opposing team with various tactics.
 </p>
 <p>
  =The 20 races participating in the League Competition are divided into five groups, with humans assigned to three groups.
 </p>
 <p>
  =The map for the three groups advancing to stage 5 is… the ‘Giant Graveyard.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A map where undead monsters mainly appear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among randomly assigned maps, it was a relatively ordinary and straightforward one in terms of difficulty.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘However… if you exploit hidden points, it becomes a map where you can bring hell to the opposing team.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Jihan didn’t remember the entire competition map, he remembered all the strategies for the Giant Graveyard map.
 </p>
 <p>
  The World Tree Elves would exploit special points if they got this map, bringing hell to the opposing team.
 </p>
 <p>
  Humanity also benchmarked their strategies.
 </p>
 <p>
  And in the end, the first to succeed in securing special points
 </p>
 <p>
  Was the TOP 100 Seong Jihan belonged to when he ranked up in his previous life.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The only problem is that this map only has undead monsters coming out.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The constellation quest told him to get 1st place in the league promotion battle using the Reaper’s power.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had to handle only the power of death, so would that work well on undead monsters?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Death might be able to completely dominate the undead, or it might not work because they’re already dead. I’ll have to try it and see.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Jihan manipulated the uncontrollable stat ‘Death’ and awaited the start of the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  And Soon,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  The 100 players in the waiting room were summoned to the assigned battlefield,
 </p>
 <p>
  The ‘Giant Graveyard’ map.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So this is the Giant Graveyard map…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s filled with nothing but tombstones.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The easiest points to defend would be… that hill over there?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Giant Graveyard map filled with nothing but sparkling white tombstones in the desolate wasteland.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fortunately, to the east and north there were gentle slopes where they could assume a defensive stance.
 </p>
 <p>
  But Seong Jihan looked around at everyone and pointed in the opposite direction.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No. Let’s go south.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “South? That side is downhill, so it might be difficult to defend…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s the only place without tombstones.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah……! You’re right!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, Uncle caught that right away. Did you have a premonition?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Yoon Seah, who had barely made it into the Diamond Promotion Battle TOP 100, grinned and spoke,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan pointed at his own eyes,
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is just intuition. I have a different premonition.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, really?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Player Seong Jihan’s… premonition has activated again!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. I’ll let you know as the game progresses.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After dramatically winning the opening match of the Space League, Seong Jihan’s premonitions had been a hot topic among BattleNet officials for some time.
 </p>
 <p>
  At first they thought he was joking, but
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Looking at Seong Jihan’s path since awakening as a player,
 </p>
 <p>
  He had always chosen the right answers among the choices.
 </p>
 <p>
  So now quite a few people believed he had the ability to see the future.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well… it must be correct if he said it. I’ll go first.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren, who had shown tremendous growth with his two status windows and participated in the TOP 100 this time, headed south first by himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although they were once at odds, after Seong Jihan gave him a hand in the Chaos Battlefield,
 </p>
 <p>
  He had changed to be quite amicable.
 </p>
 <p>
  He greatly trusted Seong Jihan’s judgement.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright. Everyone, let’s head south!”
 </p>
 <p>
  And so the TOP 100 moved in unison,
 </p>
 <p>
  =Oh!! Seong Jihan, it seems your premonition will come into play in this game too!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Haha. He’s truly a reliable player! I’m really glad he’s on our side.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Christopher, Now that you’ve become an S-rank ability user, do you need to keep commentating? I heard American First made an incredible deal offer!
 </p>
 <p>
  =After going on the dungeon exploration with Seong and Sword King… I’d still prefer to stay a commentator for now! Dungeons, they’re pretty scary!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Oh, is that so? We’ll have to hear about the dungeon exploration later when you have time!
 </p>
 <p>
  =There’s not much to it! I just hid behind Seong the whole time! Oh!!… the opposing team from the same Group 3 is appearing!
 </p>
 <p>
  The announcers who had been chatting briefly about Christopher’s dungeon exploration
 </p>
 <p>
  Focused on the roster of other species assigned to Group 3 as it appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  =The rosters of the 3 races finally appeared. First are the Orcs!
 </p>
 <p>
  =The Orc race! A species seen in the Chaos Battlefield. Player Seong swept them up so we couldn’t measure their strength, but they don’t seem to be a strong race. They’re currently ranked 20th in the league rankings!
 </p>
 <p>
  =The second race is… uh, Machines… They’re Robots!
 </p>
 <p>
  =The species is called Mechan, these guys didn’t appear in the Chaos Battlefield. They’re ranked 15th. They’re also below humanity!
 </p>
 <p>
  Orcs and Mechan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the muscular pig-headed organisms and bipedal robot race looked powerful at first glance,
 </p>
 <p>
  In fact, their league rankings were below humanity’s.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed humanity had an okay group assignment, but
 </p>
 <p>
  =Uh… Elves again at the very end! Uh, this species’ name is ‘World Tree Elves – 200’?
 </p>
 <p>
  =What, there were more World Tree Elves? Ah, the league rankings are shown too. 1st…1st place!! ‘World Tree Elves 200’ is the top ranking race!
 </p>
 <p>
  When the name World Tree Elves 200 was revealed last, both the commentators and the viewers were astonished.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  -1st place in the league?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -The elves were 1st place? And there are more World Tree Elves?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -I wondered last time since the World Tree Elves had numbers after them…….
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -WTF, does that mean they have numbers from 1 to 200?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Those damn elves… What kind of bugs are they?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Does this even make sense? BattleNet’s management is crap
 </p>
 <p>
  The World Tree Elves, who dominated humanity in the opening match. Although Jihan turned the tables in the fifth game, executing them in return, objectively, humanity was overwhelmingly inferior. But now, there’s another race from them? Viewers criticized BattleNet for the state of the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  [“Downglass” has sponsored 100,000 GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [What do we do!! We got matched up with elves again]
 </p>
 <p>
  A sponsorship informing them of the news arrived on Seong Jihan’s channel broadcasting the promotion battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so? We’ll have to prepare properly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  However, contrary to people’s surprise,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘As expected, we got matched up with elves.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan reacted as if he had expected it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘With five elves in the 20 teams of the league, it was bound to happen. Now that it has, we need to capture the points quickly.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The World Tree Elves, completely grasping the map. As they were in the same group, they had to capture the special points before passing Stage 3. Otherwise, they would occupy them first.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should discard the power of death if I can’t use it in Stage 1. I shouldn’t hold onto it sentimentally for too long.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The power of death, difficult to utilize. Jihan decided to decisively clear it in Stage 1.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the opposing team having elves, he couldn’t afford to drag the time.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stage 1 begins.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Rumble…!Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  As the game started, the ground was dug in front of the tomb, and undead monsters began to rise. Unlike common skeletons or zombie-type monsters, the Death Knights wearing sturdy armor at a glance emitted a formidable aura.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps due to the Diamond Promotion match, the monsters in the wave were overwhelmingly powerful from the beginning.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Uh. Those guys… look pretty tough?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t think of them as feeble undead. Buff us, please!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll cast magic first!”
 </p>
 <p>
  While the TOP 100 players assumed their defenses,
 </p>
 <p>
  “In the face of death, all things are equal. I, Seong Jihan, shall preside over this in the name of the Reaper.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a nonchalant expression, Jihan used the skill ‘Death Sentence.’ Only by uttering the predetermined lines could he use the power of death. Next to him, Yoon Seah, who was preparing to intercept, looked at Jihan with a bewildered expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What are you doing, uncle? Suddenly acting like a middle schooler?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Trying out a new skill.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “~Did that skullhead give you that? Why did you utter such lines? I’m embarrassed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t care what lines I spout as long as it works well. I just hope it performs properly…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan gazed at the surging crimson aura from his right hand without much expectation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……Huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead of diminishing, the light not only grew larger but also sparked a surprised look in Jihan’s eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What’s this all of a sudden?’
 </p>
 <p>
  In reality, there was hardly any reaction. However, upon entering the game, it suddenly responded tremendously .
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Clank! Clank!
 </p>
 <p>
  “……Huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are they kneeling?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The menacing Death Knight legion, which was charging fiercely, began to kneel one by one.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  =What… What’s happening here? All the undead are kneeling before Seong Jihan!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Could it be another premonition activating? But Seong Jihan seems a bit bewildered too!
 </p>
 <p>
  =If they clear the wave like this… What will happen?
 </p>
 <p>
  The situation on the battlefield, with the undead suddenly kneeling in subjugation, left the commentators and viewers bewildered. Even Seong Jihan, with his power of Death, watched the scene in confusion for a moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Why is this happening?’
 </p>
 <p>
  “Fire Wave!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, Barren who had prepared in advance used his signature magic to engulf the undead legion in flames, but
 </p>
 <p>
  [We pledge loyalty to the Reaper.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Please give us… your command.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Death Knights didn’t care if their bodies were burning,
 </p>
 <p>
  And asked Seong Jihan in unison to give them orders.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stay in that position.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, still puzzled, continued to observe them kneeling, and looked at his right hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he wondered why the power surged only in the game, Seong Jihan found himself perplexed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have dealt death to countless beings within BattleNet.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The power of death is further enhanced.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have dealt death to over ten thousand beings within BattleNet.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The power of death recognizes you as a Reaper.]
 </p>
 <p>
  System messages appeared in sequence.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Over ten thousand targets…Well, in the BattleNet, I must have killed that many.’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is this the reason why the power of death suddenly erupted only in the game?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan roughly grasped the mechanism of power of the death.
 </p>
 <p>
  In reality, he has hardly killed anyone, so the power of death did not respond much. However, in the BattleNet, Seong Jihan has brought death to many, and the power of death willingly recognized him as the Reaper.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Can only be used within the BattleNet… isn’t this half-assed?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching the power of death rising energetically, Seong Jihan coldly smiled.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s not something I can let go easily.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether in reality or in the game, he must fully control this power.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to thoroughly analyze the power of death in the competition and, while enjoying the surging deathly power, laughed coldly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Everyone, stand up……”
 </p>
 <p>
  He ordered the undead legion to rise.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Dig up that hill.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan points to the hill where the TOP 100 players were initially setting up their defense.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your command…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [We will comply.]
 </p>
 <p>
  At that, the undead legion uniformly stood up
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, they all stand up and march toward the hill. The defense map began to change its genre right from the beginning of the match.
 </p>

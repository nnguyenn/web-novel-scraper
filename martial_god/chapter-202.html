  Chapter 202
 </p>
 <p>
  Beyond the northern portal.
 </p>
 <p>
  That place was the ossuary Seong Jihan had crossed over to, and from the portal to the center, it was completely identical.
 </p>
 <p>
  And in the middle, the inverted pyramid.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jijijik!
 </p>
 <p>
  An elf who had been diligently turning the head was startled to see Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What, what is this? Why from the portal…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan charged at the elf without hesitation or excuses.
 </p>
 <p>
  The distance between them narrowed in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Great Lich…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The elf hurriedly took his hands off the head and tried to respond to Seong Jihan, but
 </p>
 <p>
  “In the face of death, all things are equal. I, Seong Jihan, will preside over this in the name of the Reaper.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wha….”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan used the skill ‘Death Sentence’ after getting right in front of him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The elf’s body melted away without even manifesting its regeneration, disappearing in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s a pretty good skill if you take out the long incantation.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan was thinking that.
 </p>
 <p>
  [A race that does not fall under the rule of death. Cannot be turned into an undead.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Eliminating.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The system message floated over his eyes belatedly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Elves cannot become undead?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  I saw that the dragons were also called bone dragons. What do you mean elves can’t become undead?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I guess I have to completely crush them.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked towards the location of the ossuary’s head.
 </p>
 <p>
  The head that had been facing north.
 </p>
 <p>
  The northern portal in the humans’ Giant Graveyard was also the place leading to the elves’ area.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the northern portal here also leads to the elves’ area…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Are the portal locations the same no matter where they lead?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The West is humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  North is elves.
 </p>
 <p>
  Are the positions all shared?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan went into the western portal to check.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then undead legions he had kept on standby earlier appeared on the other side of the portal.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The portal locations seem fixed no matter where you go.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If it’s not random, it’ll be easier to gather them all in one place.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan smiled sinisterly and entered the other two portals in turn.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s buried under the hill.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike humanity and the elves who attacked the hidden point,
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed the other races hadn’t dug into the hill.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was structured like an underground ossuary chamber.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s just turn the head and go.’
 </p>
 <p>
  After turning the heads in those two spaces all north, Seong Jihan entered the portal on the elves’ side again.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Player Seong Jihan..
 </p>
 <p>
  =Really skilled movements, It’s as if he knows everything!
 </p>
 <p>
  =He really is the elves’ nemesis! Obliterating them in one strike!
 </p>
 <p>
  =But what is he doing right now… seems to be gathering everything to the north?
 </p>
 <p>
  =Yes. The northern portal must somehow lead to where the elves are!
 </p>
 <p>
  A man wholeheartedly sending four waves of undead to swarm the elves.
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers watched this with relief.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Did Seong Jihan have a feud with the elves lol
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -He’s mobbing them LOL
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Of course he should, right? Gotta drag the 1st placers down.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Those World Tree elves really need to be contained. There’s already two teams from the World Tree series in the same league right?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Yeah… there can’t be another one right?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Oh no, hopefully not…
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash! Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  While people were expressing cautious opinions about the elves, a horde of undead began pouring out of the portal.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Looks like I’ve gathered all the waves.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The death knights filling up the space of the ossuary.
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to when they were first summoned, It seemed they had become even more enhanced after receiving the death aura.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you send these to attack through the northern portal, they’ll charge at the elves as wave monsters.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Shall we go see.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan leading the undead horde, was about to launch a full-scale invasion, however…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Emergency situation has occurred!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We need to suppress the undead invaders.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That person is leading the undead horde. Concentrate firepower on him!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even the top 100 elves weren’t just idling around.
 </p>
 <p>
  They quickly formed an encirclement towards the ossuary.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not an ordinary opponent…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “30 sacrifices. Prepare for the Great Lich!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the highly enhanced undead horde led by Seong Jihan, the elves promptly made a strategic judgment.
 </p>
 <p>
  They organized themselves into a defense line against the approaching undead forces.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Great Lich… that’s quite tricky.’
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Hearing the elves’ preparations from afar, Seong Jihan was about to launch a preemptive attack before they finished, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to show the elves’ true nature to people once more.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Since there was still leeway, he only stretched out a finger and slowly marched the undead legions forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thump! Thump!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the death aura enhanced undead legions charged forward flying.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Defend until the Great Lich is ready!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “These undead are reinforced… don’t let your guard down!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The elves also began a fierce battle against the enhanced undead horde.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite gathering all four waves and having a highly enhanced Death Knight, the elves weren’t an easy opponent.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Elves are pretty good at fighting, Even against the enhanced Death Knights they can hold their own
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -About five elves died until now, right? Their regeneration is seriously crazy LOL.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Wow, did you just see that? Even though his leg was cut off, a new one sprouted out in an instant LOL. They are really worthy of being ranked first in the league.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -No way, are they real players? Why are they so strong? Even though about 30 of them are just standing there without fighting.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -But why is Seong Jihan just standing there with his arms crossed? I feel like the game would be over if Seong Jihan stepped in since elves are strong but Seong Jihan is on another level.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -He must have his own plans. Let’s leave it to him!
 </p>
 <p>
  As people were startled again at their strength while watching the battle between elves and undead legions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Done…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Great Lich, I summon you!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The 30 elves who had finished the incantation simultaneously put their hands on their chests.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack!
 </p>
 <p>
  The elves who smashed their own bodies and pulled out their hearts.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s started.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who had been quietly watching this, lowered his crossed arms and slowly walked forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the 30 hearts burst simultaneously, Simultaneously, the entire body of the elves exploded in mid-air.
 </p>
 <p>
  Blood and flesh scattering in all directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  It gradually gathered in one area, starting to construct an enormous form.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh! Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The fragments of the body that couldn’t coalesce into one place rapidly regenerated into their original form as elves.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I summon the Great Lich!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The regenerated elves once again extracted and burst their own hearts.
 </p>
 <p>
  As they did, the gigantic figure gradually took shape, adding flesh and blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  An elf breaking his own heart with an expressionless face, and a Great Lich created through it.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Whoa, this is insane…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Ugh… so creepy…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Taking down all elf pictures in my room rn
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Whoa, it feels like it’s going to come out in my dreams.
 </p>
 <p>
  Humanity, who had almost lost to the elves in the preliminaries, even people who had a positive view due to their otherworldly beauty turned away at this sight.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  After sacrificing themselves and exploding their hearts for the 10th time.
 </p>
 <p>
  The elves no longer regenerated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead, the Great Lich had completely taken form.
 </p>
 <p>
  A giant of light, composed of radiance like the sun.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just by existing, it emitted tremendous divine power.
 </p>
 <p>
  -It sucked elf hearts while being born and now it’s sparkling like crazy lol
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Were we supposed to wait for that…?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Yeah… feels like the villain waited for the transformation scene in a show to finish right…?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Waiting for the transformation is a rule, LOL.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash! Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  As lights flashed from the Great Lich.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The undead legions who had been battling fiercely instantly burned away entirely.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite being enhanced by the power of death,
 </p>
 <p>
  The death knights couldn’t withstand even a single strike.
 </p>
 <p>
  That was how powerful the unleashed might of the Great Lich was, on a different dimension.
 </p>
 <p>
  -… Waiting was the right choice, huh?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Whoa, but… it’s too much…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Are elves really crazy? What if something like that was in the Bronze League ㅠㅠ
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Great Lich began to exert its power, people became tense.
 </p>
 <p>
  No, that power went way beyond the limit, didn’t it?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ah, Seong Jihan probably predicted everything, LOL…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Right. Doesn’t he have premonition abilities?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -He sees everything beforehand!
 </p>
 <p>
  If it was Seong Jihan with premonition abilities that’s fine but.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it wasn’t, why would he foolishly stand there and wait to fight that thing? He’d only get cursed out.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Still strong as ever.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the Great Lich, Seong Jihan recalled memories about it.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Great Lich the elves had sacrificed themselves to summon.
 </p>
 <p>
  It had a set summon duration.
 </p>

   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  ‘5 minutes.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If you endure for 5 minutes,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Great Lich wouldn’t be able to maintain that giant form and disappear as light.
 </p>
 <p>
  So normally, humanity’s way of dealing with the Great Lich was to buy time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Run away and strictly maintain a defensive posture.
 </p>
 <p>
  They simply waited until the summoning time of the Great Lich was over.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, in his past life, also followed this protocol.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Now I need to find a different strategy.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He couldn’t always be afraid and trampled by the elves and the Great Lich.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aside from the 5 minute time limit, He had to find means to deal with the Great Lichs.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey you over there! That guy messed things up…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Quickly eliminate him! And we’ll go past the portal and kill the players!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The leader of the elves said this while gritting his teeth and gave orders to the Great Lich.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, a flash of light emanated from the Great Lich’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  A powerful divine force concentrated on Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like it could purify and burn him away in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite facing tremendous lights head-on.
 </p>
 <p>
  The death aura surrounding Seong Jihan’s body didn’t disappear at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What, this can’t pierce through either?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “W, what…! The dark aura is blocking the Great Lich’s light…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  To Seong Jihan’s surprise as well,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Great Lich’s light had no effect whatsoever on the power of death.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Why is it like this?
 </p>
 <p>
  With a tilted head, Seong Jihan approached the continuously shining Great Lich.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash! Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  As if to block that approach, the Great Lich spat out lights several times but.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having semi-fused with the power of death, Seong Jihan lightly blocked those.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather, the parts that hadn’t fused stung from the heat of the light.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to spread it wider across my whole body.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He rearranged the gathered power of death across his entire skin.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Attack!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Block his approach!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the elves were surprised at Seong Jihan’s power and tried to obstruct his approach from the Great Lich.
 </p>
 <p>
  “In the face of death, all things are equal. I, Seong Jihan, will preside over this in the name of the Reaper.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Facing them, Seong Jihan instantly finished his chant as if rapping this time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then the elves, unable to withstand Death Sentence, collapsed while bleeding out.
 </p>
 <p>
  As over 30 elves died in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Re..retreat!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The elven leader quickly pulled back his body.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…At this rate we’ll get last place. We head to the eastern portal!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Then entering in a scattered manner, the elves charged into the eastern portal.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed they judged that if the game ended here, their score would be last place. So they tried to drag down other races to rock bottom as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Quite quick judgement.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Chasing down all the elves wouldn’t have felt cathartic anyway,
 </p>
 <p>
  So for now, the Great Lich took priority.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fortunately the eastern portal didn’t lead to humanity’s portal,
 </p>
 <p>
  So he decided to go later while thinking that.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan approached the continuously shining Great Lich.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Great Lich’s basis is the power of life but…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The power of life, completely opposite to the power of death.
 </p>
 <p>
  He didn’t understand why this power didn’t pierce through the power of death either.
 </p>
 <p>
  The two were extreme opposites.
 </p>
 <p>
  Normally they would collide intensely with life or death on the line,
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet harboring these doubts, as Seong Jihan approached the interior of the Great Lich.
 </p>
 <p>
  When he reached a certain spot, his eyes flashed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh ho.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the giant spirit of light.
 </p>
 <p>
  Filled to the brim with the power of life,
 </p>
 <p>
  An incompatible power was nested inside that shouldn’t be there.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he hadn’t gained the power of death beforehand.
 </p>
 <p>
  And also, if he didn’t have past experience using the power of life.
 </p>
 <p>
  He wouldn’t have noticed the stealthily hidden incompatible location.
 </p>
 <p>
  Its position was below the giant’s torso.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan blew the power of death in there.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Fragments of the elves that had disappeared floated out from there.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just like earlier in the ossuary.
 </p>
 <p>
  Elven fragments having a structure similar
 </p>
 <p>
  To a pyramid of corpses.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing that, Seong Jihan’s eyes lit up.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So this is the weak point.’
 </p>
 <p>
  When he smashed that with his fist.
 </p>
 <p>
  The form of the Great Lich crumbled in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  And
 </p>
 <p>

 <p>
  [The sponsoring constellations, ‘Brahma’ and ‘Constellation of the Dead Star’ oppose this and have exercised veto power.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The information disclosure request is rejected.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Messages quickly floated up over Seong Jihan’s eyes.

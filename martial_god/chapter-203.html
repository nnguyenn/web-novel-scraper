  Chapter 203
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yggdrasil?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the system messages with interest.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yggdrasil.
 </p>
 <p>
  The World Tree that appears in Norse mythology, so massive that it reached the universe, hence the nickname Universe Tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s probably the most famous World Tree known to humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘At this moment when the Great Spirit’s weakness has been discovered… Does this name have something to do with the World Tree Alliance?’
 </p>
 <p>
  [Note:- Changing ‘Great Lich’ to ‘Great Spirit’ for better consistency.]
 </p>
 <p>
  In his previous life, Yggdrasil had not been revealed until the extinction of humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  But it seems that due to Seong Jihan’s many unpredictable actions toward the elves, a high-ranking constellation of the World Tree Alliance had stepped in.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your sponsoring constellation, ‘Brahma,’ warns you to never get involved with Yggdrasil.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [They insist that If you must get involved, it is strongly recommended to just exchange information and then leave.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Brahma’ displayed a strong wariness towards Yggdrasil.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition:
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your sponsoring constellation, ‘Constellation of Dead Star,’ sends an urgent message.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The sponsor constellation is blocked. Would you like to unblock?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Until now, if ‘Constellation of Dead Star’ sent any useless messages, a window to unblock them would not pop up, but this time it seems that the system asked for Seong Jihan’s consent because it was an emergency.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I might as well listen to what this is about.’
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan lifted the block:
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your sponsoring constellation, ‘Constellation of Dead Star,’ emphasizes that you should neither listen to nor look at the World Tree Alliance’s proposal.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [They notify you that many who have fallen for the sweet words of the old woman have ended up becoming trees.]
 </p>
 <p>
  An old woman, is this referring to Yggdrasil?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But isn’t the disclosure of information rejected anyway? Can a proposal even come through?’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan pondered this doubt:
 </p>
 <p>
  [The ‘Universe Tree Yggdrasil’ makes an offer to the player in hideout status.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [We want to sponsor you who have shown great potential. Please disclose your information. Just reveal your information and I will give you 100 trillion GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  100 trillion GP?
 </p>
 <p>
  Last time, during the elf execution, they called for 1,000 trillion GP to annul it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Does the World Tree Alliance print GP, or is their sense of money completely paralyzed?
 </p>
 <p>
  Perplexed, the Seong Jihan didn’t respond.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Oh, we missed adding a zero. It’s 1000 trillion GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Once again, a respectful message from the Universe Tree Yggdrasil’s side arrived.
 </p>
 <p>
  A triumphant scale, increasing the GP tenfold in a flash.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan seemed to understand why his sponsoring constellations warned so strongly against their proposal.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even Seong Jihan, who harbors hatred for the World Tree Alliance, flinched momentarily because of their overwhelming financial onslaught.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s not permanently hidden, it’s just for six months…’
 </p>
 <p>
  They probably didn’t know it was limited to 6 months, so they called an exorbitant amount.
 </p>
 <p>
  Six months of hideout status or 1000 trillion GP.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it were an ordinary player, they would have chosen the latter without hesitation, but the Seong Jihan thought differently.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll reject it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The situation was financially stable for now.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather than accepting that and falling under the influence of the World Tree Alliance.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was better to buy more time, even if only for 6 months.
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon that,
 </p>
 <p>
  [To reject this proposal so categorically… we must pay more attention to you. We will wait for the day when your information is disclosed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Universe Tree Yggdrasil ended the message politely.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But the context is, “just you wait until disclosure”…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Having become an adversary to the World Tree Alliance, it was inevitable.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed he had gained the attention of a troublesome opponent.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to grow as much as possible in the remaining six months.’
 </p>
 <p>
  And that meant dominating this game first.
 </p>
 <p>
  Turning off the message from Yggdrasil, Seong Jihan looked towards the east portal where the elves had fled.
 </p>
 <p>
  The elves, who couldn’t afford to be last, invaded the territory of another race.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I wipe both of them out from there, it should work.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s form quickly headed towards the eastern portal.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  =The game situation is completely bizarre!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Wasn’t this originally a defense map? The monsters are controlled by the Seong Jihan, and the elves are slaughtering orcs while avoiding him!
 </p>
 <p>
  =The Orc tribe… seems to consist only of warriors. They’re extremely vulnerable to long-range attacks!
 </p>
 <p>
  Because of Seong Jihan, what was supposed to be a defensive game turned into a full-blown invasion.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the humans’ channel 0, the fight was now more about alien races than humans.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Elves are strong. Really strong! The orcs have now fallen to the lowest rank, overwhelmed by the elves.
 </p>
 <p>
  =It hasn’t even been 10 minutes since the fight started and there are only 30 orcs left alive! Brutally trampled by the numerically inferior elves!
 </p>
 <p>
  The elves, using their elemental magic, bombarded from the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  The orcs tried to respond to the aerial assault, either by flying or throwing axes, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  The difference in the racial specs was too severe.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Elves are a cheat race, aren’t they? Spirit magic is just insane!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Wow, did you see that? The elf got hit in the forehead with an axe, but it regenerated instantly. What kind of monsters are they?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -What about Seong Jihan who dealt with them?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Seong Jihan is just an OP existence LOL
 </p>

 <p>
  While one side was engaged in a fierce struggle among races.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, it’s boring…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Monsters are on our side, so there’s nothing to do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was so nervous during the Diamond Promotion Match. It turns out it wasn’t necessary.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aside from Seong Jihan, the human side just sat down, idly scratching the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Humans look remarkably peaceful!
 </p>
 <p>
  =The cameras assigned to humans have nothing to do. It seems like we only need to focus on Seong Jihan!
 </p>
 <p>
  =True. Aren’t we relying too much only on one player?
 </p>
 <p>
  =Where else do we have a player to rely on? Without him, we’d be in the same situation as orcs.
 </p>
 <p>
  With nothing to comment on, human commentators had to change the screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  The only person left to watch was Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Seong Jihan… enters the eastern gate and exits the underground chamber!
 </p>
 <p>
  =The undead legion from all four Ossuaries are following him. Poor orcs, it’s a bolt from the blue!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the commentator said, the map assigned to the orcs was now in full chaos.
 </p>
 <p>
  Elves, undead, and one human, all mixed up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Magic bursts everywhere, and collisions occurred everywhere.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among them, suffering the greatest damage were the orcs.
 </p>
 <p>
  “K-krk… What the hell is this!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why the hell are other races here!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The orcs, who had prepared only for the undead, thinking it was a normal defense map, suffered substantial losses from the sudden appearance of elves.
 </p>
 <p>
  We’re both going up to diamond, how can there be such a gap in the power?
 </p>
 <p>
  The orcs trembled as they looked at the elves reigning from the sky like messengers.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re last, the last!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “These crazy pointy-eared guys were originally last…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang! Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  As powerful magic rained down from the sky again.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this the end…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The orcs were bracing for annihilation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan rose into the sky above the orcs and then, from his hands, a crimson light extended.
 </p>
 <p>
  It spread widely, protecting both him and the orcs.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom! Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, magic exploded simultaneously in the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  When the fatal blow to obliterate the orcs was blocked, the elves gnashed their teeth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s him!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He followed us all the way here. It’s annoying…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Orders have been given from above. Collect his flesh or blood!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Prepare for the Great Spirit transformation again!”
 </p>
 <p>
  In that short time, whatever orders had been received.
 </p>
 <p>
  Elves, who had escaped Seong Jihan and attempted to make a getaway, once again tried to use the Great Spirit Transformation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  In the process of pulling out their hearts to create a giant, Great Spirit Transformation.
 </p>
 <p>
  All elves except the leader immediately dedicated themselves to this.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kururr… what are they doing?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now’s the time. Throw the axes!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The orcs, who had no intention of waiting for the transformation time, threw axes at the elves in unison.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sylph. Knock them down.”
 </p>
 <p>
  But their interception was entirely blocked by the remaining elf leader.
 </p>
 <p>
  The orcs naturally looked towards Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What’s he doing?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why is he waiting?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this race… humanity? Strong, but seems like a race with a dull mind.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Humans were ridiculed for their intellect by the orcs. Seong Jihan, hearing this from above, couldn’t help but feel awkward.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to test the identified weak point.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Having identified a potential weak point in the Great Spirit, he merely crossed his arms and watched the transformation.
 </p>
 <p>
  And Soon,
 </p>
 <p>
  A giant light giant, generated from the sky, touched the ground with its legs.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Humans! Such foolishness! Why did you just stand there waiting for such a monster to appear?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That, that monster… It’s enormous. We’re done…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The orcs despaired at the sight of the light giant, blaming Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Why would you wait for such a thing?
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, the elf leader clearly instructed the giant,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Great Spirit. Just inflict a scratch on him! I’ll make sure to get his blood and flesh… and escape!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The elf leader prioritized the command from above. The Great Spirit moved according to the elf leader’s request.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash! Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  Bright light cascaded down towards Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  When some orcs inadvertently closed their eyes due to the intense light,
 </p>
 <p>
  Chiiiiik…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The widely spread power of death easily repelled the light of the Great Spirit.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It couldn’t be… that attack…”
 </p>
 <p>
  They thought it was the end.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead, the assault vanished, leaving the orcs looking at Seong Jihan with amazement.
 </p>
 <p>
  How could such an overwhelming attack be blocked?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Humanity… how strong can it be?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the orcs unwittingly said this,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked towards the orcs and asked,
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  “Hey, do you have any supporters?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The voice of the human came through the BattleNet’s automatic translation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite his overwhelming strength, his voice wasn’t as intense compared to the orcs.
 </p>
 <p>
  He looked frail on the outside, but was he hiding immense strength inside?
 </p>
 <p>
  The orc leader, thinking this, answered Seong Jihan’s question,
 </p>
 <p>
  “A supporter? We’ve a shaman. Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come with me. Oh, does your shaman have a magic attack with divine power? Ranged.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Yes, they do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Prepare that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, understood. Ushon, go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The orc shaman prepared a magic imbued with holy power, as dictated by Seong Jihan, an alien race. They seemed to be enchanted by his orders.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Attack the lower part of that Great Spirit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That thing… you mean?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Following Seong Jihan’s direction, the orc shaman prepared magic with divine power.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash! Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  In the meantime, the Great Spirit expended a lot of energy trying to break Seong Jihan’s barrier.
 </p>
 <p>
  None of his attacks managed to penetrate.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What kind of power is this…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The elf leader anxiously looked back and forth between the Great Spirit and Seong Jihan when,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Attacking with the power of light against that light?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It should be useless… Are humans stupid?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just do as you’re told.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, got it. Ashpalaka!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  Shaman Ushon waved the staff, and a white wolf’s head burst forth, flying toward the light giant.
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering its size and the light emitted, it seemed likely to disappear midway compared to the Great Spirit.
 </p>
 <p>
  However…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh….”
 </p>
 <p>
  The wolf’s head, aiming for the designated position, cracked the body of the giant of light upon impact.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What, what’s going on?! The Great Spirit…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh? Me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The elf leader, bewildered, and the supporter Ushon, who couldn’t believe he succeeded, saw the giant’s body recover slightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzzzzz…
 </p>
 <p>
  However, it was noticeably weaker than before.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan became sure of something as he watched.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Clearly, the weakness from earlier is the weak point. It’s vulnerable to Divine power.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The dead elves hidden in the belly button area of the Great Spirit.
 </p>
 <p>
  Targeting that spot with divine power surely gave a significant blow.
 </p>
 <p>
  If a Diamond-level or higher player were to strike, it might show even more significant effects.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now that he knew the weakness was clear, Seong Jihan made a decisive move.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s finish this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan swiftly approached the radiant giant, breaking its weak point.
 </p>
 <p>
  Woah…
 </p>
 <p>
  The light dispersed, and the giant vanished.
 </p>
 <p>
  The elf leader, from above, watched it with vacant eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s… it doesn’t make sense…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You are the last one. Now go to the bottom.”Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the final survivor’s body exploded,
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Elves are dead!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They can’t regenerate!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Humans. They’re strong! They saved us! They’re our friends!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The orcs on the ground cheered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly appearing and sweeping away the formidable elves, they even called Seong Jihan a friend.
 </p>
 <p>
  But that ‘friend’.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You guys. Why are you happy?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s your turn next.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He had no intention of becoming friends with them.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then…
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud! Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  Undead forces swarmed in from all directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, no…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The faces of the orcs turned pale.
 </p>
 <p>
  Above them, the blades of the Death Knights descended.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  =Seong Jihan. He sweeps through the Mechan with the undead!
 </p>
 <p>
  =In the league competition, all the opponents have disappeared!
 </p>
 <p>
  “What will happen now…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, ah…! The game is ending!”
 </p>
 <p>
  With no opponents left in the league competition, it automatically ended. While the other teams were competing fiercely in defense, eliminating each other, this side seemed to have the opponents completely wiped out, resulting in an automatic first place.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps it was because they ended the game in such a unique way,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan received a deluge of reward messages.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have cleared the constellation quest.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Among all, he focused on one line.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Finally, I’ll obtain it. The Void.’

  Chapter 205
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I was already considering gradually upgrading the shop, but it turned out to be a secret shop.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Achievement shop.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once heavily utilized, it had recently been in a state of accumulating points as there were few places to spend them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nevertheless, now that he had fulfilled the donation requirement, a prerequisite for upgrading the shop, Seong Jihan decided to upgrade it.
 </p>
 <p>
  I would have started spending points in earnest by the end of January, now that I’ve also been promoted to Diamond.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A secret shop… I need to see what it sells.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan opened the secret shop.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Secret Shop – Void LV.1]
 </p>
 <p>
  Secret Shop Upgrade – 5,000,000P
 </p>
 <p>
  Status Window Enhancement LV.1 – 1,000,000P
 </p>
 <p>
  Class Enhancement LV.1 – 1,000,000P
 </p>
 <p>
  Title Fusion – 1,000,000P
 </p>
 <p>
  Alternate World Space – Open for 1,000,000P, consumes 10,000P per day when activated
 </p>
 <p>
  [All items in the secret shop have an expiration date, and their validity period is proportional to the void stats.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The amount of points required is astronomical.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Secret Shop – Void.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though it was only level 1, the required achievement points were staggering. Moreover, there was no limit. If Seong Jihan had to rely on achievement points as before, he might have hesitated to approach it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But now, with over ten million points remaining, I have some room.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who shone twice in the Space League, had earned an enormous amount of achievement points.
 </p>
 <p>
  After making significant achievements in the Space League twice in a row, Seong Jihan’s current achievement points exceeded ten million. He decided to experimentally invest some points.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Still, spending one million each time is a bit much. Let’s raise the Void stat to 50.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Constellation of the Dead Star warned me not to invest in Void stats.
 </p>
 <p>
  But it should be okay if I don’t go up to 100, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  Besides, with the Void stat of only 5, there seemed to be no issue. Other than the secret shop, Seong Jihan didn’t notice any significant changes.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to find out what this ability is.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Determined to invest, Seong Jihan wholeheartedly invested the stat points he had accumulated. Initially, the Void stat increased smoothly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Gradually, the additional point requirements are increasing.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Later on, it started requiring two additional points, and in the end, three points were needed to increase Void by 1. Seong Jihan ended up using all his points at Void 42, feeling excited.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Up to 100 will take a while.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I don’t have to worry about being bound to the will of Void, for now.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan examined the tangible effects on his body for the number of points invested.
 </p>
 <p>
  And
 </p>
 <p>
  The power of death, which didn’t show much effect in the real world,
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as he invested points in Void stats, he discovered it began to exert a presence like in the games.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘In addition… The shadow ability has become even more distinct.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In a broader sense, it seemed to enhance powers related to the dark attribute, shadow, and death. Was Void reinforcing all of these? Sung Jihan was discerning the changes in his internal energy when,
 </p>
 <p>
  [You can absorb ‘Shadow sword’ and ‘Death’ stats into Void.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Would you like to absorb?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Upon absorption, Void stats will rise. Under the jurisdiction of Void, you can use both powers in an enhanced form.]
 </p>
 <p>
  An additional message popped up for Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Was the Void ability a higher concept that encompassed all attributes related to the darkness?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should absorb Death that has an expiration date first.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Death’s power supplied to me for a week by the Constellation of the Dead Star.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since it would disappear later, it was better to use it to enhance the Void. Seong Jihan proceeded to absorb death first.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  A crimson light flashed across Seong Jihan’s body and disappeared into his body.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  [The stat ‘Death’ and the skill ‘Death Sentence’ are fused into the Void.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Void stat increases by 5.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Just 5?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The death ability, which had been quite useful and powerful.
 </p>
 <p>
  But even with an expiration date, it only increased the stat by 5? Seong Jihan was initially slightly disappointed with the result.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No, this… now I can use Void just like Death’s ability. And the power of the ability has strengthened even more than in the game.’
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  After testing various aspects of his body, Seong Jihan’s eyes lit up.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the game, if absorbing the power of death showed a 20% enhancement buff effect, the power bound to the Void now seemed to have a 40% effect.
 </p>
 <p>
  For Seong Jihan, who had already become stronger, a 40% buff was a tremendous boost.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing this doubled effect, his attention naturally turned to Shadow sword as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ariel, come out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel who had been sealed inside for a while to completely break the Constellation Quest with the power of death,
 </p>
 <p>
  She emerged from Seong Jihan’s arm and revealed her form as a shadow elf.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, is it time to lift the seal? Master.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. You’re not completely entangled with my ‘Shadow sword’, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master’s Shadow sword? I only get strengthened by the shadow energy from there. I’m not tied to stats. I’m a separate being.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then it should be fine to merge it with Void.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh? Void? Why is that suddenly coming up?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait and see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sealed for a while, Ariel, unaware of what had happened, saw Seong Jihan merging Shadow into Void.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The stat ‘Shadow sword’ is fused into the Void.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Void stat increases by 8.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  In a flash, Seong Jihan merged Shadow sword into Void, surprising Ariel.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh, what is this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Growing rapidly, Ariel’s head reached the ceiling. Her body was flashing violet.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Control that shadow energy for a second!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, wait.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The shadow power, much stronger than the original Shadow sword due to increased Void stats to 55, and the amplification effect,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel returned to her original size once Seong Jihan recollected the energy.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What… Master, this power…! It felt similar to when the Queen directly infused her energy into me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Comparable to the Constellation?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course, the Queen has far more total shadow energy. But the precision of energy was… really similar. Void… Does merging with Void unleash this kind of power?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel was still in disbelief, touching herself all over.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Shadow sword and the power of death have fused with the Void, becoming much stronger than before… but I still don’t quite get the Void itself.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I understand that Void swallows darkness attributes and makes them its own,
 </p>
 <p>
  But not quite what the Void ability itself is.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should dig deeper into Void later, let’s make use of the shop first.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to focus on what he could do right now.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s go for the enhancements first.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He expended 2 million achievement points to choose the enhancement of the status window and class.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The status window is enhanced.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [All stats in the status window are enhanced by 20%, and both the experience gain and stat growth rate increase by 50%.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The enhancement effect will last for 55 weeks.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The ‘Void’ and ‘Martial Soul’ stats are not included in the enhancement.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The class is enhanced.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Class traits are enhanced, and the All for One effect is amplified by 100%.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The inspiration of Four-Style Player activates more frequently. When training in the Alternate World, this inspiration will activate even more often.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The enhancement effect will last for 55 weeks.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though the enhancement effects excluded Martial Soul and Void, the benefits were significant enough for the 1 million points spent on each.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Even though it’s almost useless without the enhancement of Martial Soul and Void, the growth speed has increased.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Having become one of Earth’s strongest warriors, Seong Jihan still had a long way to go compared to a god. Nevertheless, he was quite pleased with the effect this time.
 </p>
 <p>
  And
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Both for 55 weeks… It matches the Void stat number. Seems interconnected.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The effective period tied to the Void ability stats.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like every unit raised the period by one week.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Among the effects of the Four-Style Player, does training in Alternate World relate to ‘Alternate World Space’?
 </p>
 <p>
  The space of the Alternate World listed at the bottom of the secret shop.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was puzzled at first about what use it could be.
 </p>
 <p>
  But considering the Four-Style Player’s additional effects, it seemed related to space for training.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should try opening it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The space of Alternate World, costing 1 million to open and 10,000 per day to maintain.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the cost was significant, Seong Jihan, who prioritized martial arts enhancement, invested without hesitation.
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  And
 </p>
 <p>
  [The space of the Alternate World, accessible only by the player, opens.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The player can use this as a ‘hideout’ or ‘training ground’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [For what purpose will you use the space of the Alternate World?]
 </p>
 <p>
  A message came up asking about the use of the space of the Alternate World.
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering the Veil Of Void I gave to Seah,
 </p>
 <p>
  The shelter of the Alternate World seemed like it would have a powerful effect.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But a training ground is better than a hideout.’
 </p>
 <p>
  For Seong Jihan, who still has a long journey ahead, the latter was more appealing.
 </p>
 <p>
  When he chose the training ground,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The space of the Alternate World will be utilized as a training location.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You can manifest the interior of the space as you wish.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Within the training ground, the flow of time is 5.5 times slower than reality.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘5.5 times?’ Does this also sync with the Void 55?
 </p>
 <p>
  A training ground that gives 5.5 times more time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the items sold in the shop, this was far more valuable to Seong Jihan than the earlier enhancement effects.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll use the training ground right now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The space of the Alternate World is being manifested.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as Seong Jihan finished the promotion match.
 </p>
 <p>
  He entered the newly created training ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  And
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is… revolutionary.’
 </p>
 <p>
  There, he saw the possibility of perfecting Crimson Thunder.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  In a hotel suite room in Vladivostok, Russia.
 </p>
 <p>
  Vladimir, Russia’s top warrior, knelt on the floor of the room, praying with a reverent expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh Constellation… The time has come.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Contrary to his appearance in the game, where he was known as a Berserker, he now maintained an extremely polite attitude.
 </p>
 <p>
  And for a good reason.
 </p>
 <p>
  The subject of his current prayer was the sponsoring constellation that had promised to further enhance him.
 </p>
 <p>
  One day, the constellation ‘The One Who Kills Gods’ suddenly bestowed support upon him.
 </p>
 <p>
  This constellation, with an unusual name, had given him a specific command.
 </p>
 <p>
  [When you fight Seong Jihan, pray to me and I will descend upon you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  -Seong Jihan… are you referring to?
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. Once the match is over, I will upgrade your gift to SSS grade.]
 </p>
 <p>
  -But he is a hero to humanity. It’s wrong to harm him…
 </p>
 <p>
  Given the benefits humanity had gained from Seong Jihan’s actions, Vladimir seemed to be hesitating. Despite his defeat to Seong Jihan in the game with South Korea, considering the Space League, his existence had been crucial for humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  When he expressed his concerns, the constellation made a promise.
 </p>
 <p>
  [It will be just a short education session within BattleNet. I will not cause him any harm.]
 </p>
 <p>
  -B-but…
 </p>
 <p>
  [Otherwise, since he’s humanity’s hero, is it okay for Russia to just lose? If so, just surrender and raise the white flag to Korea. What’s the need for a national match then?]
 </p>
 <p>
  -…Alright, I understand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Overwhelmed by the constellation’s coercion, Vladimir eventually consented.
 </p>
 <p>
  And on February 1st,
 </p>
 <p>
  When the newly opened Northeast Asia League’s first match clashed with Korea,
 </p>
 <p>
  He agonized but eventually offered his prayer.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Yes. National matches are separate. I owe Seong Jihan, but if there’s a chance for Russia to win, we must win by any means. Besides, my gift will be upgraded to SSS grade…!’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Vladimir rationalized his decision,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  A dazzling white light enveloped his entire head suddenly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… Ah…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Overwhelmed by an immense headache, he grasped his head and collapsed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shortly thereafter,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Constellation ‘The One Who Kills Gods,’ a servant of the Martial God, Longinus, descended upon Vladimir.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan… Let me educate you properly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Taking possession of Vladimir’s body, he chuckled sinisterly.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a confident smile, confident that he would emerge victorious.

  Chapter 207
 </p>
 <p>
  =Will Russia ban player Seong Jihan or Yoon Sejin? There has been much debate…
 </p>
 <p>
  =Russia’s choice is to ban the Sword King!
 </p>
 <p>
  =And the map allocated is… Huh? Lone Bridge!!
 </p>
 <p>
  While it was a pick between two options to ban the Sword King, Russia’s next choice left everyone baffled.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Uh… wasn’t this map selected by us?
 </p>
 <p>
  =Yes, it’s a simple map with a single bridge where both sides clash, with no variables, just a direct confrontation of strength against strength!
 </p>
 <p>
  =It’s the most advantageous map for Korea, which has strong warriors… it’s puzzling why Russia would choose this!
 </p>
 <p>
  Lone Bridge,
 </p>
 <p>
  Known as the arena of all-out confrontation, this map was used as a defense map to stop incoming enemies during the tutorial.
 </p>
 <p>
  But in national representative matches, it showcased battle dynamics where two teams advanced from opposite ends of a giant bridge to compete.
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering the map’s nature, where battles end on a single bridge, warriors were crucial.
 </p>
 <p>
  And Russia picked this, having been trampled on by Seong Jihan when he was gold-ranked?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Lone Bridge? Is that what they call the arena of all-out confrontation?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Did Russia give up on the match? LOL
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -I’m predicting a clean 3:0 victory.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -At this point, did the coach mistake the select card for a ban?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -That’s a possibility, for sure.
 </p>
 <p>
  Korean fans were already in celebration mode as if they had won the match.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, the Russian coach, who made such a decision, was sweating furiously, frowning.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Damn it, Vladimir!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Unbeknownst to him, the situation had changed completely.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Vladimir was the reason why he had no choice but to make such a decision.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Set the map for the first match to Lone Bridge. Or I won’t play.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although he was often called a Berserker due to the Gift ‘Frenzy,’ Vladimir was generally known for his friendly personality. But today, he was different.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Note:- Changing “Rampage” to “Frenzy”.]
 </p>
 <p>
  His words were disrespectful, and he used a commanding tone with the coach.
 </p>
 <p>
  However…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I had no choice…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Vladimir’s overwhelming presence forced the Russian coach to simply nod continuously.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he had chosen a different map for the first game, Vladimir’s boycott wouldn’t have been the problem. It seemed he wouldn’t let him go unpunished.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, let’s see how confident you are… I’ll be watching you, Vladimir.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Russian coach glared at the game screen as he gritted his teeth.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the starting point of Lone Bridge, 100 Russian players were preparing.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Russian warriors typically formed a triangle formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Vladimir sir. Aren’t you going to join the triangle?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Please come to the front!]
 </p>
 <p>
  They intended to highlight Vladimir at the front tip, the focal point.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do you guys really need to be there?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes…?]
 </p>
 <p>
  As Vladimir waved his hand backward once.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  The bodies of the Russian players burst in unison.
 </p>
 <p>
  All 99 players vanished.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What, what the hell is this maniac doing…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  When the Russian coach was startled and jumped up from his seat,
 </p>
 <p>
  Vladimir slowly opened his mouth, looking at the spots where the players turned into blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Transfusion.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The players’ remains disappeared in an instant, and only blood remained, all sucked into Vladimir.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the blood of all 99 players concentrated on him, his figure swelled immensely, wrapped in the blood.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  =No, what, what is this? Player Vladimir!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Did Russia prepare for this in advance?
 </p>
 <p>
  =Even with such a suicidal act…
 </p>
 <p>
  As the game began, Vladimir, who had transformed into a giant made of blood by exploding all his fellow players.
 </p>
 <p>
  -?? What is he doing?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Wow, but was Vladimir always so strong? One gesture and they all blew up…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Is this pre-planned by the team?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -It doesn’t seem that way…
 </p>
 <p>
  As confusion spread among the commentators and viewers who didn’t understand English,
 </p>

 <p>
  [Great Sword of the Cranium, answer my call.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The clustered blood dispersed and a giant cross began to take shape behind Vladimir.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Cross of Blood, the Great Sword of the Cranium.
 </p>
 <p>
  Wielding a greatsword over 3 meters tall, Vladimir, now larger than life,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Seong Jihan… Let me properly educate you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  looked over the bridge at Seong Jihan, flashing a sinister smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Something is off. Vladimir wasn’t that caliber of warrior before.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan furrowed his brows as he observed the unfolding events from across the bridge.
 </p>
 <p>
  Vladimir of Russia.
 </p>
 <p>
  Vladimir of Russia, while consistently ranking high in the warrior rankings in his past life, was hindered by the limits of the Gift Frenzy, and couldn’t grow beyond a certain level. But now, with a single gesture, he had annihilated 99 opponents. Additionally, the enormous blood red blade raised questions.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Something has changed.’
 </p>
 <p>
  This won’t be easy.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan drew his sword and spear preparing himself,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Vladimir, shrouded in a blood mist, appeared in front of him in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Fast…!’
 </p>
 <p>
  An incredible physical feat.
 </p>
 <p>
  That momentary move had far surpassed the supposed strongest warrior in the world, the Sword King.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  With the gigantic cross of blood aimed directly at him, and droplets of blood sprouting like a mirage, Seong Jihan was completely surrounded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom! Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  His sword and spear moved quickly to defend against the attack, but the droplets spread out in the air, continuing to circle around him.
 </p>
 <p>
  An attack by the enemy that could not be defended by physical strength alone.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If that’s the case, I’ll counterattack.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan aimed the tip of the Phoenix Spear at Vladimir.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nameless divine art, Fusion of Divine thunder and phoenix – Crimson Thunder cannon
 </p>
 <p>
  Zap!
 </p>
 <p>
  Immense Crimson lightning burst forth.
 </p>
 <p>
  The crimson electric current fully penetrated the Great Sword of the Cranium and Vladimir.
 </p>
 <p>
  The droplets evaporated, scattering away,
 </p>
 <p>
  and Vladimir’s body was instantly engulfed in flames, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Haha… I gotta give you some credit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bubbling…
 </p>
 <p>
  Bubbles rose in the surrounding atmosphere as blood droplets emerged, attaching themselves once again to Vladimir’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even after being struck by the Crimson Thunder that had been enhanced in the Void training ground,
 </p>
 <p>
  Vladimir kept producing droplets in mid-air, reconstructing his body.
 </p>
 <p>
  An opponent with leisure.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He is underestimating me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s eyes sank with chilliness.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whatever had made him this strong, it was unpleasant to be looked down upon by the opponent.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll use my full power.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Smoothly…
 </p>
 <p>
  A purple energy emanated around Seong Jihan, and was then absorbed into his body.
 </p>
 <p>
  The power of Void which had absorbed the power of death as one of its branches.
 </p>
 <p>
  The effect that enhanced abilities activated on Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh… this power. Could it be?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Vladimir’s eyes widened with interest at the sight.
 </p>
 <p>
  His response was as if he knew something about it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan felt an ominous vibe.
 </p>
 <p>
  Very few knew about the void, yet he seemed to recognize it?
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ve meddled with something dangerous. Is this the last desperate struggle to defy your master?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You… aren’t Vladimir, are you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Haha… Try your best to endure. Let me enjoy this some more.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Vladimir, undaunted even by the enhanced Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come forth, Cranium.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Summoning again the huge sword of blood, he charged at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom! Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  Every collision exuded droplets that burst from the sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  They morphed into spikes, assailing Seong Jihan from all angles.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the main attack from the enemy and the by-products created by the bursting sword to consider,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s troublesome.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Nameless Divine Arts, Dark Shadow Technique – Dark Soul Vortex
 </p>
 <p>
  The form of Eclipse, the Shadow Sword, crumbled, transforming into a vortex. It swallowed the blood spikes approaching from all directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good, good.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Vladimir smiled, apparently enjoying the sight.
 </p>
 <p>
  Currrr…
 </p>
 <p>
  Crimson lightning storms span from the spearhead multiple times, while the Shadow Sword perfectly shielded Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Externally, it appeared that Seong Jihan had the upper hand in both offense and defense.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  =The opponent… resurrects again!
 </p>
 <p>
  =The Crimson lightning surely burned his body to a crisp! Vladimir keeps regenerating in mid-air!
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  =I never expected to see such tenacity vitality from our race, surpassing the elves!
 </p>
 <p>
  Vladimir did not die, no matter how many times he burned.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not only his body but also the floating blood droplets, despite being completely incinerated by Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Where was it being produced? Blood kept flowing in mid-air, continually reconstructing Vladimir.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Where did such a guy come from?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Vladimir, who kept reviving despite being slammed by the Crimson Thunder.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing this approach wasn’t going to work, Seong Jihan contemplated his next move.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Not a scratch after so many attacks.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The resurrecting Vladimir wore a different expression from the start; his composure was gone.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition to his main attack with the blood sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Countless assaults at Seong Jihan through airborne droplets had been executed, yet he remained completely unscathed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is he worthy of the choice of Martial God after all?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The one who had seized Vladimir’s body, Longinus, silently admired him.
 </p>
 <p>
  The vital energy gained by exploding 99 national representatives, though insufficient for his full power, was thought enough to annihilate Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed he had underestimated the ability of Martial God, after all.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I need to draw out more power.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Vladimir, regenerating for the 17th time, knelt to place his palm on the bridge.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Blood Cross.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  The bridge was instantly tainted blood red, and a cross of blood began to emerge.
 </p>
 <p>
  A menacing aura sprouted among the trembling droplets, affecting not just Seong Jihan but also the national representatives behind him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh… my body is bleeding…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Get as far from the bridge as you can!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even outside the range… it’s affecting… Heal me, please!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The players were sweating blood, not normal sweat, even outside the range of Blood Cross.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were rapidly weakening.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Uh…
 </p>
 <p>
  =What on earth are we witnessing? Player Vladimir…!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Tearing the game apart all by himself…!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Sweating blood, not sweat… Haven’t we seen Seong Jihan do something similar before?!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Yes, previously, against Russia! Though at that time, the cross was made of steel…
 </p>
 <p>
  Vladimir was using a skill eerily similar to Seong Jihan’s.
 </p>
 <p>
  While speculation swirled,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, looking at the Blood Cross, was certain.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’m sure now. He’s related to the Marital God.’
 </p>
 <p>
  An opponent using a power almost like the Blood Cross.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although it didn’t absorb metal as the original did, Blood-absorbing power was significantly stronger.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘And that power… what could it be?’
 </p>
 <p>
  With an endless regenerative capacity surpassing even an elf, and freely manipulating vital energy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the opponents he encountered, Longinus was a particularly tough adversary.
 </p>
 <p>
  But now, having set apart his Blood Cross with determination,
 </p>
 <p>
  it was the most formidable power he had seen yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But is also the easiest to confront.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan crossed his sword and spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nameless Divine Arts, Annihilation God’s Secret – Blood Cross.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Blood Cross spread out against the massive pool of blood,
 </p>
 <p>
  But compared to the Longnius’s Blood Cross, it seemed almost feeble.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially the metal across horizontal, which was almost non-existent.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the vital energy down vertical was completely overwhelmed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Blood Cross looked like it would vanish any second.
 </p>
 <p>
  But
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  What seemed to be engulfed by the Blood Cross gradually became clearer with time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially the vertical vital energy takes on a deeper hue.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘As expected.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan affirmed as he saw it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is an inferior version of the Blood Cross.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…You.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Vladimir’s face hardened at Seong Jihan’s conclusion.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I only meant to teach you a lesson… but that won’t do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Lesson? You are the one who needs to learn from me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You insolent…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Was it those words that hit a nerve?
 </p>
 <p>
  His face distorted with rage, as if it was breaking.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I will give it my all. I will rip you apart…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Vladimir, now even more determined to draw upon his power.
 </p>
 <p>
  Blood energy converged from the Blood Cross on the floor back to him, swelling his body.
 </p>
 <p>
  But
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wha…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Vladimir, inflated like a balloon, couldn’t withstand it and exploded mid-air.
 </p>
 <p>
  And
 </p>
 <p>
  [Avatar ‘Vladimir’ fails to absorb the power of the Blood Cross and explodes.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The first match comes to an end.]
 </p>
 <p>
  In front of Longinus, a system message appeared, indicating the end of the game.

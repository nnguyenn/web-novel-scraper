  Chapter 208
 </p>
 <p>
  Russian players’ waiting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mr. Vladimir. you should have warned us in advance. Isn’t this too much?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “To suddenly kill us…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The players, who were logged out in advance, tried to protest to Vladimir as he came out of the BattleNet Connector, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shut up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  When he emitted a powerful aura, they couldn’t even make a sound. Although these players were powerful Diamond players, Vladimir, or more precisely, the Longinus within him, was genuinely furious.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Veins surged in Longinus’s eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Power of Blood Cross…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The power of “God Slaughter” that the Wandering Martial God had stolen from Longinus.
 </p>
 <p>
  It manifested as the Iron Blood Cross and a spear that pierced through it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Up till now, Longinus thought that out of the two, only the “God Slaughter Spear” had been snatched away by the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘To be pushed back starting from the Blood Cross as well… does this mean my powers are inferior?!’
 </p>
 <p>
  The situation just now.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clearly, he still had room to absorb more power.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the reason his body burst was because he couldn’t absorb the power of “Blood Cross”.
 </p>
 <p>
  To think his Blood Cross was deemed an inferior version from the start by the Martial God…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…I can’t tolerate being embarrassed by someone other than the master.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Had it been the Martial God himself, Longinus would have understood.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was an absolute existence, after all.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, no matter how much he had assimilated with the divine powers.
 </p>
 <p>
  His pride would not allow him, Longinus, to be pushed back by a human who had just become a Diamond to this degree.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Vladimir. I’m going to modify your body a bit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Uh, er, wait a minute… what do you mean by modify…!?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’ll be good for you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [But, hang on! How are you gonna modify me…?!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The original owner of the body pleaded for Longinus to at least tell him what he planned to do, but
 </p>
 <p>
  Longinus, with eyes rolled back, did not answer his question.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  And scratched Vladimir’s face with his fingernails.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Wha, what are you doing…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “A mere scratch on the face shouldn’t matter, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  From the forehead to the chin.
 </p>
 <p>
  A long wound gashed vertically across Vladimir’s face.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing this, the Russian players around them shuddered.
 </p>
 <p>
  From their view,
 </p>
 <p>
  He was muttering to himself before suddenly scratching his own face – a madman.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I don’t think that’s just a wound…’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Mr. Vladimir… shouldn’t you be going to a psychiatric hospital?’
 </p>
 <p>
  And then.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  When red smoke rose from the wound.
 </p>
 <p>
  Vladimir smiled with a grim expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now, you will become stronger.”
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  = Although we won the first game…
 </p>
 <p>
  = Vladimir showed a distinctly different side from before. I almost thought he would lose!
 </p>
 <p>
  The first game, played on a bridge with a single path, showed a surprising performance from Vladimir, and discussions continued even after the game ended.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why is Vladimir so strong? His movements were no joke.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -I thought it was over when he inflated his body at the end.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -I saw the Russian community, and they were also puzzled.
 </p>
 <p>
  Expecting an easy win but opening it up to find completely unexpected variables – was that why?
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite winning the first game, the Korean fans were even more uneasy than before the game started.
 </p>
 <p>
  And Seong Jihan also did not let down his guard.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Although we won the first game, I can’t guarantee the next.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In the previous life, Vladimir didn’t display such a demeanor. Perhaps this time, it’s because Seong Jihan gained Martial Soul. It seemed to be associated with the Martial god.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether any Constellation intervened or another variable was at play was uncertain. However, it was evident that his abilities were beyond the norm.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Iron Blood Cross seemed to be a critical weakness for him… If we face off again in the next game, I’ll have to make use of it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan set the Iron Blood Cross as a key point while he contemplated countermeasures.
 </p>
 <p>
  = Game 2. Russia uses a ban card on Sung Jihan!
 </p>
 <p>
  = Did the loss in the first game hit hard? Russia chooses to face the Sword King!
 </p>
 <p>
  Russia chose to face the Sword King in the second game.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  ‘I thought they were going to target me again… Unexpected.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Since the opponent was related to the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan assumed they would doggedly focus their attacks on him, but
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, bans and selects are decisions made by the Russian coach.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Sung Jihan decided to observe the situation for now.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s my turn this time. I’ll be back, brother-in-law.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin, who slowly got up from his seat.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unable to watch the match directly due to his lost vision, listening only through the commentary – he posed a question to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They say Vladimir has become strong. How much?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Very strong. He has a powerful regenerative ability surpassing elves, and even if his form is destroyed, he attacks by moving blood droplets.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… that does seem tricky to deal with.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. And he tried desperately to tear into me; getting hit once could wear me down.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll be careful.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The two discussed Vladimir as Sejin’s next opponent.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you really need to be careful though?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Pardon?”
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the national team coach Noh Youngjoon poured cold water on their heated discussion.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We can just ban him too, you know. Vladimir.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The ban card is not something only the opponent can use.
 </p>
 <p>
  During the first game, since they didn’t know Vladimir would turn out that powerful, they used random cards banning several players.
 </p>
 <p>
  But now that Russia’s key player is exposed, they can focus the ban solely on Vladimir.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just hold back even if you want to clash with him again. We need to win the first series.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “When there’s a shortcut, no need to take the long way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll follow the coach’s decision.”
 </p>
 <p>
  And so in the second game with Vladimir and Seong Jihan banned.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ahh. The Sword King summons the White Sword. All 100 swords rush towards the enemies!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Seeing Yoon Sejin massacre the opponents with Sword skills just like in the past national team matches, I feel emotional.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Swords rain down from the sky like a downpour. The enemies can’t even properly block a single sword!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sword King completely crushed them.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Its not just you who can use ban cards? We can do it too, haha.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Having two key cards makes things comfortable.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -I heard that a player can only be banned twice in a row. Is that really true?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -You can do it 3 or 4 times too. However, from the 3rd time onwards, it goes into probability.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Yup, From the 3rd time onwards, there is a 50% chance.
 </p>
 <p>
  If they banned Seong Jihan 3 times in the 3 game series.
 </p>
 <p>
  For the final match, banning him has a 50% probability of success or failure due to the ban card option.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Then, just keep Vladimir banned till the next game.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Since he definitely can’t appear twice, ending it by the 3rd game should work.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -That’s right. If we drag it out to 4 games, it won’t work because it will become a battle of odds.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -It was important to win the first game haha.
 </p>
 <p>
  The fact that Vladimir didn’t get banned in the first game worked well this time. If they stop banning after the second or third game. It seemed like Korea could easily win 3-0.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It was an easy game.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sword King Yoon Sejin returned after easily winning MVP in the second game.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I wanted to face Vladimir once, but I don’t think I’ll have the chance.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anyway, it’s a league match, so we’ll meet again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, that’s true. “That’s right. I’ve played against Russia many times before. I guess I’ll have to try it next time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  They were already considering the game as over if Vladimir gets banned in the next game, in fact, there aren’t many variables left in the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  =South Korea bans Vladimir! Russia, once again, bans Seong Jihan!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Haha then it will be a replay of the second game, right? The map is important, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  ==That’s right. From the third game, you can choose a map where only specific classes can participate. Coach Youngjoon Noh’s map pick is Valhalla! The warrior map!
 </p>
 <p>
  =A map that maximizes our strengths!
 </p>
 <p>
  =And Russia’s selection is… ugh, ‘Golem Duel’!
 </p>
 <p>
  There were still variables in the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Golem Duel huh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t that a supporter map?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. It’s a common map for supporter promotions.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A special map where only specific classes can participate. While Korea trusted powerful warriors and chose Valhalla, Russia, confident in the strength of their supporters, chose Golem Duel.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This… the outcome will be determined by the map, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Russia believes their supporters are stronger than ours?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That seems likely.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Warriors and archer classes are strong for Korea. Mages and supporters are generally considered strong for Russia.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course there was the variable of the all-rounder Seong Jihan who could turn such evaluations on their head, but
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  ‘My all-round class is useless on this map too.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The supporter-exclusive map ‘Golem Duel’ was a unique case. Instead of combat abilities, supporters with developed abilities to care for teammates. When they faced promotion matches, they either played the game as a team or held separate matches for supporters only.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Golem Duel’ was one of those maps.
 </p>
 <p>
  On this map, except for supporters, other classes were completely useless.
 </p>
 <p>
  The supporters buffed their assigned golems, who fought in their place.
 </p>
 <p>
  They had to use healing spells timely and apply suitable buffs depending on the situation
 </p>
 <p>
  To lead their proxy golem to victory in the ‘Golem Duel’.
 </p>
 <p>
  On this map, players other than supporters were completely useless.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the supporters could not intervene in battle apart from buffs and heals.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This map could completely lock me down.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Among supporter-exclusive maps, Golem Duel was the most restrictive for Seong Jihan. If they were fighting on the same battlefield as the golems, Seong Jihan could take the lead and defeat them.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, this map conceptually separated the space, with supporters giving buffs from outside. It was a map that was essentially his arch-nemesis.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘After this game other countries will probably bring out Golem Duel maps to use against us.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan figured this game would set a precedent for other nations to take out their Golem Duel cards after seeing how useful it was to counter them.
 </p>
 <p>
  He watched closely, wondering what map would come out.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Oh…! ‘Golem Duel’ map is selected!
 </p>
 <p>
  =In the third game, it seems luck is favoring the Russian coach more!
 </p>
 <p>
  =In this case… everything depends on the capabilities of the supporters.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Generally, Russia’s supporters are considered slightly superior to South Korea’s supporters, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  =Still, the difference is not significant! South Korean supporters! You can narrow this gap as much as you want!
 </p>
 <p>
  The commentators expressed disappointment over the selection of the Golem Duel map but emphasized that if the supporters did their best, they could win. However, the audience had different opinions.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Look at them hyping it up, haha. The difference between Russian and South Korean supporters is at least two levels, haha.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Since Golem Duel makes the buff effects crucial, no way we are winning, right?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -It’s going to be the fourth game, haha.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Oh, Seong Jihan, what are you doing? Quickly charm Sophia and make her your concubine!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Seong Jihan already taken tho;;
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Do it for the nation! Date one more!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Nation-sponsored two-timing lmao
 </p>
 <p>
  Audience already concluded, it would go to the fourth game.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the match progressed exactly as anticipated.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Oh… The golem. It’s exploding…
 </p>
 <p>
  =Russia’s supporters are strong.
 </p>
 <p>
  =It looks like it will go to the fourth game!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Then Vladimir’s ban will be lifted…!
 </p>
 <p>
  2:1.
 </p>
 <p>
  Korea’s lead remained, but the previously perfectly blocked variable, Vladimir, was now free in the next game. The national team felt a slight tension.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is… It’s not ending easily.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s how it turned out.”Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om
 </p>
 <p>
  “If the same map selection comes in again, it might be better to ban the enemy supporter instead of Vladimir, who can’t be banned.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Since the ban comes first, we can’t know what map will be chosen.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Naturally, Russia won’t choose a supporter map, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  2:0.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a critical moment, Russia secured victory by choosing the map wisely. They would probably try the same formula for victory in the fourth game.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If they pick a mage map or something, Seong Jihan will crush them all.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Unless it’s Golem Duel, I can handle supporter maps too. Just let me step onto the battlefield and it’ll be over.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Haha. Indeed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Everyone assumed Russia would desperately pray for the Golem Duel map to come out again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Amidst such expectations…
 </p>
 <p>
  The bans revealed for the fourth game were Vladimir and Yoon Sejin.
 </p>
 <p>
  Next, the select card revealed by Russia was unexpected: [Valhalla]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Valhalla?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are they out of their minds?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t tell me they still trust in Vladimir…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Abandoning the winning card shown in the third game, Russia chose the map that Korea wanted, Valhalla.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Russia…
 </p>
 <p>
  =I don’t understand this choice…
 </p>
 <p>
  =Are they trying to give Vladimir one more chance?
 </p>
 <p>
  Commentators expressed their doubts, and the screen focused on the Russian coach.
 </p>
 <p>
  The coach’s face, sinking into a reddish hue, was visible.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan vaguely sensed that it might not be his own will.
 </p>
 <p>
  Vladimir.
 </p>
 <p>
  No, the person related to the Martial God inside him probably led this decision.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unsure what he was thinking, trying his luck even with a 50% chance of getting banned.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But victory for Russia probably isn’t important for that guy related to the Martial God.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He likely only wants revenge against Seong Jihan from the first game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan chuckled as he stood up from his seat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s finish up this series.”

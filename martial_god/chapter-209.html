  Chapter 209
 </p>
 <p>
  The map was Valhalla, exclusively for warriors.
 </p>
 <p>
  The walls were made of golden shields and the majestic pillars holding up this palace of warriors were giant spears.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a map where 50 warriors were selected from each team to battle it out in Valhalla’s enormous hall.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah, the viewership has surpassed the highest record!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Higher numbers than the 2018 Champions League Quarterfinals match!
 </p>
 <p>
  =As the first international representative match since BattleNet’s main game launch, it seems many overseas are also watching the game intently!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Player Vladimir’s transformation must have contributed as well!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Yes, he demonstrated a really shocking spectacle! He was banned for matches 2 and 3 but… he’s appearing in the 4th game!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah. The 50 percentage probability didn’t work out! Coach Noh Youngjun’s ban was ineffective!
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash! Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Russian warriors summoned from the west.
 </p>
 <p>
  And at the very front was Vladimir with a face full of scars.
 </p>
 <p>
  -?? Why is his face like that?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -It wasn’t like that in the 1st game!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -He’s completely become a monster;;
 </p>
 <p>
  Just a few hours ago his face was still unmarred, but now Vladimir’s face was completely covered in scars.
 </p>
 <p>
  He glared at Seong Jihan summoned in the east.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  He stamped his foot on the floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Transfusion.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom! Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  The warriors behind him began exploding in unison.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just like in the 1st game, Vladimir detonated his allies.
 </p>
 <p>
  Their flesh and bones vanished instantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  And only blood droplets remained hovering in the air, surging towards him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially the blood that gathered on his face.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gulp! Gulp…
 </p>
 <p>
  It stuck to his scars, dyeing his entire face red.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘His aura is even stronger than before.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the number of players he exploded was only half that of the 1st match.
 </p>
 <p>
  The aura he emitted was more powerful than last time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan glanced back at his warriors.
 </p>
 <p>
  Korea’s warriors without the Sword King amongst them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the Northeast Asian League participating countries they were the weakest.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I ignore them, they’ll probably end up like that too.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Allies who would be of no help against Vladimir, only becoming an energy source for the enemy instead.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was best to quickly get rid of them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nameless Divine Arts, Annihilation God’s Secret – Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan took out a sword from his inventory and stabbed it into the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then mystical patterns instantly spawned on the floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods which had now become a disposal tool for the useless allies.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh… hang on….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re getting sucked in…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  And just like that, the 49 Korean warriors disappeared in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah!
 </p>
 <p>
  =What’s going on here!?
 </p>
 <p>
  =Right after start, the 100 warriors have all vanished except for 2!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Player Seong Jihan probably made the decisive action knowing his allies would fall victim to Vladimir’s “Transfusion”!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Certainly, there is no need to provide more battle power to the enemy!
 </p>
 <p>
  Vladimir, who had blood streaming into his face, looked at him as if to say “how preposterous” and raised his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  And
 </p>
 <p>
  Bwash!
 </p>
 <p>
  Blood exploded in mid-air.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Uh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  =The screen is being obscured by blood!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Wha, what is he doing!?
 </p>
 <p>
  =Blocking the broadcast screen, how is this even possible…!?
 </p>
 <p>
  The relay screen was dyed red with blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  After blocking external eyes like so, he slowly opened his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “To utilize the divine art of Myriad Ghosts Seal in such a way… The Martial God would sigh if he saw this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Myriad Ghosts Seal is a divine art?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the patterns of Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is a divine art?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Divine art huh… what exactly do you mean by that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not even knowing what it is yet daring to steal it… Did the Martial God impart his skills separately to you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  How can you exhibit it without even knowing what an art is?
 </p>
 <p>
  Longinus, having taken over Vladimir’s body, interrogated Seong Jihan in disbelief.
 </p>
 <p>
  But,
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  “Well, I just happened to know it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan simply answered as such.
 </p>
 <p>
  He couldn’t tell his past life story to the opponent after all.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha, you just came to know it? How arrogant. An impudent fellow soon to be trampled by the Martial God.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, that Blood Cross is your art right? That’s the easiest though, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You little…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Taking it then giving it back verbally to Vladimir.
 </p>
 <p>
  He couldn’t hold back his rage at Seong Jihan’s words belittling the Blood Cross.
 </p>
 <p>
  “To disparage the art of God Slaughter like that…! Utterly unacceptable!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The blood aura obscuring the screen gathered in one area
 </p>
 <p>
  And Vladimir’s Blood Cross began to reveal its form again excluding an even more intense aura compared to the 1st game.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the blood aura blazed around him, he let out a sinister blood fog.
 </p>
 <p>
  Vladimir now looked more like a monster than a human.
 </p>
 <p>
  But more than his enhanced form,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘God Slaughter? The Blood Cross is God Slaughter skill? Huh…….’
 </p>
 <p>
  From Vladimir’s words, Seong Jihan obtained a hint regarding the Iron Blood Cross.
 </p>
 <p>
  Drawing the cross of iron and blood,
 </p>
 <p>
  And a spear piercing through atop that person to instantly kill them – the Iron Blood Cross skill.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Seong Jihan had modified it for use as a powerful defense tool.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘As expected, the culminating spear attack was the main point.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching this crazed fellow related to the Martial God, he could grasp the essence of the Iron Blood Cross that he had only vaguely predicted until now.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I won’t let you die easily!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  The enraged Vladimir charged forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom! Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  Dozens of exchanges occurred instantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike the 1st game, the Blood Cross Sword did not burst.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Uh…
 </p>
 <p>
  =Player Vladimir. He is too strong!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Player Seong Jihan is struggling with defense!
 </p>
 <p>
  =The battle situation is distinctly different from the 1st game…!Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om
 </p>
 <p>
  The reappeared battle scene, To the 3rd party commentators, it looked like Seong Jihan was being completely overwhelmed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The tough-as-nails Blood Cross Sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the pointed blood aura assailing him from all sides.
 </p>
 <p>
  Plus Vladimir’s physical abilities which had become at least twice as fast compared to the 1st game.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow… isn’t that way too OP?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -How did he get so much stronger than the 1st game?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -No way, if he was already that strong he should’ve shown this power during the Space League. Why only go all out now?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -For real lol. That level could even beat a high elf~
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed amazing how Seong Jihan was holding out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Vladimir had completely seized the upper hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This guy…!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Longinus inside Vladimir was unsatisfied with the current situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  By now, their physical abilities surely showed a difference.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even with Seong Jihan simultaneously utilizing the power of Void, His stats still couldn’t catch up to Longinus who had modified the avatar to suit himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  But
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Could it be… the choice to become the Martial God wasn’t mistaken?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite being completely overwhelmed in power, Seong Jihan didn’t allow a single attack.
 </p>
 <p>
  He desperately tried to tear into his skin to absorb all of his blood essence, but
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s smooth evasion and defensive skills were admirable even from his enemy perspective.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But now… it’s over!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The two warriors who had now reached the corner of Valhalla,
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Blood Cross Sword swelled, having gathered ample blood aura.
 </p>
 <p>
  It completely sealed off Seong Jihan’s escape routes, trying to skewer him.
 </p>
 <p>
  But then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Nameless Divine Arts, Annihilation God’s Secret – Iron Blood Cross
 </p>
 <p>
  A pure white cross with a hole in its center floated before Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  And as it was imbued with the aura of life.
 </p>
 <p>
  A green protective shield wrapped around his body.
 </p>
 <p>
  The defensively modified Iron Blood Cross in Seong Jihan’s style.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thi, this, this…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Longinus, still wielding his sword, froze at the sight of the modified Iron Blood Cross.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although he knew about the existence of this altered Iron Blood Cross, It was his first time seeing it directly with his own eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  He would have thought anger at a non-Martial God daring to tamper with it would surge, but
 </p>
 <p>
  “…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead it felt like cold water was poured over his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  His rage subsided and rationality returned.
 </p>
 <p>
  How could he even think of changing that perfect Iron Blood Cross…?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why did you modify the manifestation of a completed art to suit yourself?”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Longinus’s question.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Iron Blood Cross was complete? That thing?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan scoffed in disbelief.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Drawing a cross then stabbing the middle with a spear is complete? Just stab if you wanna stab. Use it to defend if you wanna defend with the cross. It’s so troublesome.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Trouble……some?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At those words, Longinus’s eyes shook violently.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God’s skills are… troublesome?
 </p>
 <p>
  As someone who lived as the Martial God’s follower, it was a notion he couldn’t even imagine.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But you don’t have a spear attack other than drawing the cross?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Take note and try changing it later. Here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud! Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan knocked on his own Iron Blood Cross as he said that.
 </p>
 <p>
  Longinus let out a hollow laugh.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……Separating God Slaughter?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah why not?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Modifying the Martial God’s skills to suit himself…!?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is it because he is ignorant?’
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  Just having such an idea itself was far too great a shock for Longinus.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The blood aura gathered in Vladimir dispersed.
 </p>
 <p>
  And his face which had been obscured, unable to be shown looked blank, as if his soul had left him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Twitch!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Blood Cross Sword in his hand moved, trying to change.
 </p>
 <p>
  First it became a blade with only one side.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then it shifted into a hammer, then into a club next.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the blood freely congregated and dispersed, the Blood Cross created various weapon shapes.
 </p>
 <p>
  But
 </p>
 <p>
  Just one.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Spear’ could not be materialized.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……I, Longinus, cannot do it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Staring at the blood aura which refused to transform into a spear shape despite repeatedly trying.
 </p>
 <p>
  Longinus muttered in a stunned voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Longinus?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Longinus, famous for piercing Jesus with a spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Seong Jihan didn’t believe in any religions, he had heard that name before.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Holy Lance Longinus was quite a famous weapon in myths.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But he can’t use a spear?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Does he have some connection with the Martial God?
 </p>
 <p>
  But then why was Longinus known to have stabbed with a spear in later generations?
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as Seong Jihan was feeling puzzled after hearing that name.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, no…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  Longinus, who had been standing there absent-mindedly with a blank expression, suddenly opened his eyes wide.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Longinus.]
 </p>
 <p>
  He could hear the voice of the Wandering Martial God by his ear.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Use the spear.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master… you permit it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I do.]
 </p>
 <p>
  With the Martial God’s approval.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The spear form which had refused to actualize no matter how many times he tried to transform it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Was instantly embodied in Longinus’s hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Longinus clicked his tongue in frustration as he looked at the materialized blood spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  To think something so simple couldn’t be done without permission.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You did it huh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Master… allowed it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You need permission for every single weapon you wanna create?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. That is the destiny of a follower.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Affirming Seong Jihan’s words, Longinus stared blankly at the blood spear he created.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s rare for Master to permit spears until now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The powerful God Slaughter Spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was only temporarily allowed against mighty Constellations or when great battles were imminent.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God had been quite sparing when it came to granting spears.
 </p>
 <p>
  But to think he permitted it against Seong Jihan, in a BattleNet game match like this…!
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Could the Master also desire the skill modifications Seong Jihan mentioned…?’
 </p>
 <p>
  If so, he had to obey as a loyal follower.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Longinus raised the spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan. You said to take note of the stabbing?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh-huh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then let me show you…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  The spearhead pointed at the white cross.
 </p>
 <p>
  “God Slaughter’s Spear.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Longinus’s blood aura focused into a single point.

  Chapter 210
 </p>
 <p>
  Longinus’s God Slaughter.
 </p>
 <p>
  To the eye, it was an all too simple stabbing.
 </p>
 <p>
  The vigor that had gathered at the tip of the spear was now being absorbed into the spear itself.
 </p>
 <p>
  The blood spear, glistening with a bloody sheen, was slowly extending towards the Iron Blood Cross.
 </p>
 <p>
  Its movement, considering the enhanced physical abilities of Longinus just moments ago, was laughably slow, to the point where one might wonder if it was some kind of a joke.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is this really the God Slaughter?’ one might doubt, but just when such thoughts arose.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kuk…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The physical form of Avatar Vladimir, extending the spear, was melting rapidly from the tips of his feet.
 </p>
 <p>
  “… Is this your limit…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  With that being his last word.
 </p>
 <p>
  Longinus, turning instantaneously into blood, was absorbed by the blood spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  [All players of the opposing team have fallen in battle.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The game will end soon…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Subsequently, a message popped up indicating the opposing team had all perished, ending the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What? Over already?’
 </p>
 <p>
  No way, is this a joke?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was left dumbfounded.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had anticipated witnessing Longinus’s version of the God Slaughter,
 </p>
 <p>
  Only for it to be thwarted right in front of his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Nevertheless, the spear is still coming.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even with the disappearance of Longinus’s main body.
 </p>
 <p>
  The blood spear was leisurely flying in his direction.
 </p>
 <p>
  At a glance, it seemed far from what you’d call a spear capable of killing a god.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll have to confront it, nonetheless.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Before the game concluded, Seong Jihan decided to step forward himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘My body…’
 </p>
 <p>
  When he tried to take a step, his body had hardened, completely out of control.
 </p>
 <p>
  And it wasn’t just Seong Jihan who had stopped,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Even the system has halted.’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The game will end soon. You will be logged out,’ should have appeared, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  The system messages… no further progress was made.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a world that had come to a halt,
 </p>
 <p>
  Only Longinus’s spear leisurely floated in the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Time stop… Does this have to do with his God Slaughter?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan pondered, trying desperately to find a way out of the current situation by contemplating inwardly.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were many kinds of powers, including those with martial soul and void,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It barely moves at all…’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was as if he had lost control.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s body was not responding.
 </p>
 <p>
  At best, the only thing trying to move was the energy of Martial Soul and void.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though he tried his best to regulate just that,
 </p>
 <p>
  The slowly approaching blood spear was already drawing near.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the tip of the spear dug into the cross,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ffft, ffft, fsshh…
 </p>
 <p>
  A bloody mist rose from the point of impact.
 </p>
 <p>
  And above it, faint purple letters appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not Korean, not English, they were entirely new characters.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Why…can I read it?’
 </p>
 <p>
  For some reason, Seong Jihan could read them without difficulty.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Target conditions, partially met.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Extinction code activated.]
 </p>
 <p>
  And as those letters disappeared into thin air.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  A huge hole was blasted through the center of the Iron Blood Cross,
 </p>
 <p>
  As the blood spear burrowed into the gap.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  And like that, the tip of the spear pierced Seong Jihan’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shwooosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The power flowing from the blood spear instantly erased his physique.
 </p>
 <p>
  As this unfolded, one energy in particular seemed to resist dissolution, the energy of Martial Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pierced by the spear, Seong Jihan instinctively felt,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This power… completely opposes Martial Soul. On the other hand, the void… it’s trying to use it for itself.’
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  The God Slaughter spear, erasing the energy of the martial soul but moving the void to its own will.
 </p>
 <p>
  Initially, Seong Jihan had retained control over the void but,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No, I need to see how this works out.’
 </p>
 <p>
  To see how the blood spear intended to utilize the void, he decided to follow its movement.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the void merged, the blood spear inside him showed a peculiar flow.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Huh…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even as his upper body was blasted more than half open,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was preoccupied with analysing the movements of the blood spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  The blood spear was nibbling away at Martial Soul in a completely new way,
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet its movement held a consistent pattern.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is this related to the extinction code…?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The term ‘Extinction Code’, which he could inexplicably read.
 </p>
 <p>
  Intuitively, Seong Jihan realized that this peculiar flow suppressing Martial Soul in combination with the void was linked to the Extinction Code.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Good.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even as his body was being erased,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was engrossed in analyzing the spear of God Slaughter.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You will be logged out.]
 </p>
 <p>
  When the time stop of the blood spear ended,
 </p>
 <p>
  He could feel the flow of time returning.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What a shame.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If only he had more time to analyse.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even with his torso gone, leaving only his head and limbs,Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan lamented that he did not completely understand the ‘Extinction Code’.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘However… I did uncover something.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even with a gaping hole in the middle of his body,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s eyes were clearer than ever before.
 </p>
 <p>
  The spear of God Slaughter.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was worth experiencing
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, on South Korea’s Channel 0.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah, both players. What are they talking about… Unfortunately, we can’t hear them from the broadcast.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah, player Vladimir has created a spear with his hand! The blood is gathering at one point… looks like he’s preparing for a major move!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Player Seong Jihan! Are you just going to stand by and watch?
 </p>
 <p>
  As the conversation between Seong Jihan and Longinus was muted,
 </p>
 <p>
  Their clash was being broadcasted.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Today’s broadcast has been full of incidents;
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Vladimir is just standing there, gathering blood on the spear, it clearly looks like he’s about to use a killer move, why is Seong Jihan waiting??
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -It’s a tradition to wait in situations like this lol
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -No, he was completely pushed back just now. Now is the chance to counterattack. What will he do if he misses out on a win?
 </p>
 <p>
  People who couldn’t hear the conversation couldn’t understand why Seong Jihan was standing by.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, such concerns vanished as soon as Vladimir’s body was absorbed by the blood spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Huh??
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -What’s going on. Vladimir… Why is he being absorbed by his spear?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -lol!! Failed ultimate skill?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Look at that. Do you think Jihan had a premonition? He was waiting because he knew it.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -For real lol!! Why are there so many doubters? Seong Jihan has it all figured out, let’s just follow him lol!! I think Seong Jihan was just standing to experience Vladimir’s death.
 </p>
 <p>
  To those unaware of the circumstances, it looked as if his premonition had been activated again.
 </p>
 <p>
  =The game will now end.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Korea… wins 3:1 against Russia!
 </p>
 <p>
  =The final confrontation ended somewhat anticlimactically…
 </p>
 <p>
  =But, what does it matter! Victory is what’s important!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the broadcast concluded,
 </p>
 <p>
  The scene where Seong Jihan was pierced by the blood spear amidst the halted world was not captured.
 </p>
 <p>
  Could that be why?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow, did you wait until the end knowing Mr. Jihan? Did you expect Vladimir to get absorbed into his weapon?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your premonition is really amazing… Have you dreamed of anything good again?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The players approached Seong Jihan, speaking only of the premonition.
 </p>
 <p>
  No one mentioned the scene that unfolded after the game ended.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Premonitions aren’t something you can just have as you wish. You have to see more for what’s to come.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan responded lightly to the players,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Coach. I’ll be heading home right away.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He informed Coach Noh Youngjun that he was leaving.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right now? Even though there’s still the MVP interview…”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Please handle that in my stead. After dealing against Vladimir, it made me think of something I need to train on.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “About… training?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Noh Youngjun looked at Seong Jihan with a face full of dismay.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What kind of training demon is he?’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was already the talk of the town that he’s always cooped up at home for training.
 </p>
 <p>
  But should there not be a moment to at least make a victory speech?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is it because you don’t like the interview announcer, maybe?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No? I don’t even know who it is. I’ll be going now. See you later!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why? Let’s go together.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m faster on foot.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, Seong Jihan vanished, using his Flashing Sky Thunder Steps technique.
 </p>
 <p>
  Noh Youngjun watched him disappear, dumbfounded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Sejin. Can you do the interview instead?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I guess if it’s for my brother-in-law.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  For anyone else, he might have hesitated, but if it was for his brother-in-law’s sake, He would willingly stand in.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you. But, what training is so urgent?”
 </p>
 <p>
  From the coach’s perspective, it was a relief to have a player who strives to become stronger so autonomously.
 </p>
 <p>
  But one also had to take breaks.
 </p>
 <p>
  Noh Youngjun coach shook his head, preparing for the interview with Yoon Sejin.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  On the star of martial gods, Tusung.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…He endured it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In the broadcast, Longinus, who had witnessed the last scene that was not captured, let out a disappointed smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Seong Jihan’s body had completely vanished except for his neck and limbs,
 </p>
 <p>
  Which would have been almost certain death if it had been in reality,
 </p>
 <p>
  [His whole body didn’t disappear in an instant.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “….That’s right. Master. He resisted the power of the God Slaughter.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Typically, if one were directly struck by the God Slaughter spear, their entire body would vanish immediately.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet Seong Jihan persevered until the time stop was lifted and time flowed anew.
 </p>
 <p>
  Maintaining his physical form for an extended period.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Not bad at all.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Rarely does sentiment come across in the voice of the Martial God, but a sense of satisfaction was detected.
 </p>
 <p>
  [However, merely enduring is insufficient. He will need to show evolved strength.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Longinus, next time, I will permit you to use the spear against him. Bring out his limits.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you, Master.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Wandering Martial God who typically did not allow the use of spears, Was permitting it freely against Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Longinus bowed to the Martial God and then withdrew.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you… alright?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Beside him, walking with a vacant expression, Dongbang Sak made his way over. He approached Longinus, stroking his beard.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Dongbang Sak, did you see it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. I too must test him through my avatar. I watched the game for reference.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Phew…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Longinus let out a deep sigh.
 </p>
 <p>
  “My spear being blocked by a mere human… Originally, I didn’t find the taste of victory appealing, but today, it’s even worse.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You destroyed his torso, didn’t you? If any more time had passed, the rest would have crumbled as well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Dongbang Sak… Why are you doing this, knowing full well? He is human. When the spear touches him, his body should disappear instantly. Yet he endured it…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A human…”
 </p>
 <p>
  At the lamentation of Longinus, Dongbang sak uttered in a significant tone.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you really think so? Do you consider him a human?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you mean?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak took out a bottle from his waistband.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s go inside to talk.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He opened the bottle’s cork and,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak and Longinus were both sucked into it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who on Tusung would hear us that we had to come in here…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Longinus complained, but Dongbang Sak replied quietly,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t the Martial God listening?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…So he can’t hear us here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just for a moment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  This bottle is immune to the gaze and ears of the Martial God?
 </p>
 <p>
  Longinus looked around curiously, and then asked Dongbang Sak,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why should we avoid talking about whether Seong Jihan is human or not in front of the Master?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well… It’s just my one-sided guess.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak glanced around and then whispered softly,
 </p>
 <p>
  “From what I see, that boy, Seong Jihan… might be a ‘kin’ to the Martial God.”

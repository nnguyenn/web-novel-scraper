  Chapter 215
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud! Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  The first race that arrived was a bipedal monster wearing red armor all over its body, with brown skin.
 </p>
 <p>
  The monster, twice the size of a human, with long protruding fangs, wandered around Seong Jihan’s mid-boss room.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Is anyone here?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The monster scanned Seong Jihan’s mid-boss room,
 </p>
 <p>
  searching for the owner of the passage indefatigably.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Over there, below.]
 </p>
 <p>
  One of them spotted Seong Jihan, pointing at him with their finger.
 </p>
 <p>
  [A race as diminutive as a child, it seems.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [He doesn’t seem like a mid-boss.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [But I can’t see the face well… It’s covered in darkness.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Due to the hideout effect, Seong Jihan’s appearance was not visible to this race. However, since the rough silhouette was revealed, the monsters ignored him, judging only by his size.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Standing there all alone… could it be a trap?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Let’s get rid of it first.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Once we do, the mid-boss should show up.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Kill it!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  The long protruding fangs turned bright red, and the monster’s skin instantly turned red.
 </p>
 <p>
  And in an instant, a horde of monsters rushed towards Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although they talked about it being a trap, there was no hesitation in their advance.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The color is slightly different, but the appearance is quite similar to the troll race.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Trolls, possessing powerful physical abilities and overwhelming regenerative powers.
 </p>
 <p>
  The red monsters in front of him looked quite similar to those who occupied the middle and lower ranks in the Space League where humans belonged.
 </p>
 <p>
  Is the troll race not exclusive to a single planet?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Are the weaknesses the same?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s Eclipse, the shadow sword, revealed its appearance in his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sword lightly drew a horizontal line.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nameless Divine Art, Triad of Martial Mastery – Total Annihilation
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Snap!
 </p>
 <p>
  The fangs of the red troll were split in half.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Kook…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Th-the teeth…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The trolls that were quickly advancing all fell, rolling on the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Their weakness is also their teeth.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The teeth of the trolls.
 </p>
 <p>
  While it was a crucial means to enhance the trolls, breaking them greatly weakened their power.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the strength of their teeth was incredibly hard, so attacking them as weaknesses was generally ineffective. Still, once they were broken, it significantly weakened their strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘As I expected, its too easy.’
 </p>
 <p>
  To Seong Jihan, they were just monsters that were easy to deal with.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the sword moved again, the necks of ten trolls fell simultaneously.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have repelled the invaders].
 </p>
 <p>
  [Boss points increased by 100].
 </p>
 <p>
  He earned points from them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Is it giving 10 points for each?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Scoreboard.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan opened the scoreboard to check his rank.
 </p>
 <p>
  1st – Artemus Legion (Artemus) – 192,340 [Open]
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  2nd – ?? – 97,220
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  3rd – ?? – 72,770
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  4th – ?? – 40,410
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  ……
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  11th – Nameless (Seong Jihan) – 100 [Open]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Why is there such a big difference between 1st place and me?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps because he had intruded in the middle of a special dungeon map.
 </p>
 <p>
  The gap between him and the first rank was surprisingly wide.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked behind his scoreboard.
 </p>
 <p>
  From 2nd to 10th place, there was a [?] mark, indicating that their information was not revealed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The fact that all information about 1st place was visible was probably because he had revealed the mid-boss room.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Press [Open] to view the publicly available boss room of the competition.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do you want to inspect the opponent’s boss room?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Following the system message below the scoreboard, Seong Jihan immediately clicked [Open] for first place.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, a large screen appeared in front of him,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Publicized boss room, replaying the interior of ‘Artemus Legion.’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The appearance of Artemus Legion, the 1st place boss room, was revealed.
 </p>
 <p>
  -What is that….
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Dwarves?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -The first-placed boss looks so underwhelming, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers who were watching Jihan’s channel through the screen expressed their confusion when they saw the appearance of the publicly disclosed Artemus Legion.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Artemus Legion. Get ready!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Artemus Legion on the screen looked like a weak dwarf race at first glance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Their size was barely half of a human, and the boss room was filled with numerous dwarves.
 </p>
 <p>
  Behind Legion, various weapons were piled up like a mountain.
 </p>

   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  -The weapons look quite good.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -What… is it? Dwarves?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -A blacksmith race? The appearance is somewhat similar.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the viewers commented on the first-placed boss room,
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud! Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  Many invaders entered the boss room of Artemus.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The treasures of Artemus are here!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ignore the legion! It’s profitable even if we only take the weapons!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Invaders more intent on grabbing the weapons behind the dwarves than fighting legion itself,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Charge!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The dwarfish legion moved in unison to block them,
 </p>
 <p>
  clinging to the colossal invaders in a flash.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Annoying little…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom! Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  Countless dwarves exploded while trying to withstand the attack of the giant invaders, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  Swooosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if they died and disappeared, similar-looking dwarves continued to emerge from the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Deal with them roughly and grab the weapons!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Unable to withstand the continuous assault of the dwarf legion, the invaders focused on grabbing weapons while ignoring the dwarves.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Argh… there it is…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Uh, secured. Put it in the inventory!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Thunk! Thunk!
 </p>
 <p>
  While being overwhelmed by the concentrated attack of the dwarves and gradually dying one by one, the invaders who managed to get their hands on the weapons died happily.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Dwarves’ supply assault lol
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -But are the weapons really that good? They seem to love dying.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Invaders keep coming, wow
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Tactics of luring monsters for treasures, it seems.
 </p>
 <p>
  The seemingly weak dwarves guarding the treasure, coupled with the tempting treasure, explained why numerous invaders were flocking towards them.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, as Seong Jihan observed the dwarf legion, his gaze turned cold.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Externally weak, but… their actual power might be different. It can’t be weak; otherwise, they couldn’t keep 1st place.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If the displayed power was everything.
 </p>
 <p>
  Artemus wouldn’t have been able to maintain 1st place until acquiring 190,000 points.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  artemus
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  Behind the seemingly weak appearance, there must be hidden strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Artemus. Playing pranks again.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Newbies always fall for it.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the extraterrestrial viewers who entered Seong Jihan’s channel, After seeing Artemus’s boss room, they evaluated it as bait.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps this was a well-known method already.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But the strategy seems quite solid, doesn’t it?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s eyes gleamed as he continued to watch Artemus’s boss room, where intruders kept coming without a break.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if it was a bait, the weapons seemed so tempting, and the continuous influx of intruders increased Artemus’s point acquisition speed significantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to benchmark this.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan turned on the dungeon manager option to review the items once more.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This is it!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [He really is unprepared, isn’t he?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Even the name on the passage is Nameless!]
 </p>
 <p>
  As various races continued to invade the dungeon,Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait a second, I’m busy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan swung his sword once, all of them were split in half.
 </p>
 <p>
  -A boss worthy of his rank.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -He should be in the upper ranks with that strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  After Seong Jihan cut down the invaders with a single stroke, the extraterrestrial viewers raised their evaluations.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But still, the limits of the race are clear. Despite that, it’s still worth invading compared to other routes.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Let’s unite on this route. If we attack together, we might be able to block them.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Okay.
 </p>
 <p>
  Putting limits on human potential, they even planned a joint attack.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why are those guys openly plotting in someone else’s chat room? Ugh.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Now even aliens are messing around lolol
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Shouldn’t public access be stopped now? ㅠㅠ
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  └└ You have to attract a lot of enemies to raise your ranking.
 </p>
 <p>
  While viewers were bewildered by these extraterrestrial races, Seong Jihan noticed something interesting.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Oh, there’s such an option.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s eyes twinkled as he looked at an item he had passed by in the dungeon manager options earlier.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright, let’s decorate the room a bit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Tap, tap.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan organized his thoughts, he touched various items in the manager options.
 </p>
 <p>
  [1,000,000 GP has been consumed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [1,000,000 GP has been consumed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  With a million GP disappearing each time, brilliant gold bars began to materialize in all directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Simultaneously, the dim space transformed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The floor was adorned with pristine white marble, and the walls were covered in gold.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh… the room suddenly became splendid.
 </p>
 <p>
  -What are those gold bars? They’re shining so brightly.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  -It turned into a treasure vault all of a sudden, lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  As viewers observed the abrupt changes with fascination:
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, each of these gold bars is worth 1 million GP.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud, thud, thud…
 </p>
 <p>
  Behind Seong Jihan, the gold bars started piling up like mountains.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Are you trying to follow artemus? How much will those GP bars get you…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Don’t need to do that; they would invade since it’s so easy anyway.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Well, that’s great. Overpower him and gain GP.
 </p>
 <p>
  At first, the extraterrestrial races viewers responded indifferently to Seong Jihan’s ploy, but then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay. These diamonds… they give stat points, don’t they?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Surprise overcame them as he placed giant diamonds atop the gold bars.
 </p>
 <p>
  -What?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -That’s a 5 stat point diamond!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -He summoned another one!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Did he really just summon that… Is he crazy?!
 </p>
 <p>
  Giant diamonds that one could only summon at the risk of their own stats.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since extra stat points were the most precious commodity in BattleNet, the extraterrestrial beings watching Seong Jihan’s channel went wild.
 </p>
 <p>
  -No need to form an alliance!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -It’s ours!
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud! Thud! Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  With giant diamonds placed, the noise in Seong Jihan’s boss room intensified rapidly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rumble…
 </p>
 <p>
  As the doors of the boss chamber opened on their own,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Out of the way!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [We’re first!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [There really are stat diamonds…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  A plethora of monsters, their eyes bloodshot, began to pour in.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good effect.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swooosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan grinned and raised his sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Cheeeeeek!
 </p>
 <p>
  They got cut in half by Seong Jihan’s sword
 </p>
 <p>
  There were all kinds of races, but Seong Jihan’s sword split them all equally in half.
 </p>
 <p>
  [He’s strong!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, the enemies behind him hesitated for a moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Still, I can’t miss the stat diamond… … !]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Warriors, prepare yourself for defense and go!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [There is no need to fight him. Just take the diamonds!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Stat diamonds made them forget their fears and Various monster races advanced again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at them and smiled.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Diamonds definitely work better than gold bars. huh… … .’
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan once again wiped out the enemy with one sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Through manager options, the dungeon name was changed from nameless.
 </p>
 <p>
  11th place – I have 10 diamonds (Seong Jihan) 700
 </p>
 <p>
  As a latecomer, attracting customers is Seong Jihan’s top priority.
 </p>
 <p>
  He decided to put diamonds, which everyone was passionate about, at the forefront.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow, the name of the dungeon is to try and attract bait lol
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -If the diamonds were taken away, won’t Seong Jihan’s stats disappear??
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -No way he’s gonna let that happen
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -But if a lot of enemies come… … .
 </p>
 <p>
  Human viewers were happy at first when they saw the dungeon name but
 </p>
 <p>
  -Are you fr?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -10 diamonds?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -It’s real.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -There are 10 diamonds. It really exists!
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, viewers with star marks started flowing in like crazy.
 </p>
 <p>
  -… … Isn’t this dangerous?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -There are so many extraterrestrial races here.
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers started to slowly worry.
 </p>
 <p>
  and
 </p>
 <p>
  thud! thud! thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  The door to Seong Jihan’s boss room opened.
 </p>
 <p>
  Enemy races gathered in countless numbers, incomparable to before.
 </p>
 <p>
  [There it is!! The real diamond!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Charge!!]
 </p>
 <p>
  They start rushing towards the diamonds fearing nothing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s effective.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan took out the sword and the phoenix flag.
 </p>
 <p>
  [W-what… … .]
 </p>
 <p>
  [This monster… … !]
 </p>
 <p>
  In one day, he surged up to 7th place in the rankings.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “There are 10 diamonds…? I guess I should go see this.”
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  Not only the invaders from the dungeon but also unexpected entities began to take notice, earning Seong Jihan even more attention.

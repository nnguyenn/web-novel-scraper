  Chapter 216
 </p>
 <p>
  After residing in the mid-boss room for 7 days, Seong Jihan continued to fight against enemies without logging out.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow… still playing the game?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Really been going for 7 continuous days
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -I took a nap and you’ve risen to 2nd place?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -At this rate, isn’t Seong Jihan going to collapse? ㅠㅠ
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Yet he seems too fresh for that…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Seriously, he swept them away with one stroke again lol
 </p>
 <p>
  Those who couldn’t watch for the past 7 days slept and came back to the channel, comfortably watching Seong Jihan’s game, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  -This opponent… is strong.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -No race so far has been able to block even one of his assaults…!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -We… we’re raising the difficulty of the passage ‘We have 20 diamonds,’ and giving up on the strategy.
 </p>
 <p>
  The extraterrestrial races gradually gave up on Seong Jihan’s boss room strategy, which was upgraded from ‘We have 10 diamonds’ to 20 diamonds.
 </p>
 <p>
  Understandably so.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Have you come?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  Every time Seong Jihan swung his spear, the races entering the mid-boss room were split in half and disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite preparing powerful defense formations, the extraterrestrial races couldn’t block the single blow from Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  [We can’t do this. Let’s cooperate.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [If we enter simultaneously, we won’t be able to do anything about that little guy…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The races that experienced Seong Jihan’s strength first realized his power and tried to coordinate with each other, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  “They seem a bit more prepared this time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  With his eagle eyes focused on the spear instead of a sword, Seong Jihan shot out a barrage of attacks.
 </p>
 <p>
  Zizijik……!
 </p>
 <p>
  Unable to block that single blow, everyone was wiped out.
 </p>
 <p>
  -… Jeez. This mid-boss seems to be the strongest.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Artemus might be the only one who can handle him.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -We’re withdrawing too. We can’t get rewards whether it’s 20 or 100 diamonds.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -‘Human’ hideout player… I’ll remember it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players who entered with their own preparations and plans were wiped out. Losing the initiative, the extraterrestrial races gave up on Seong Jihan’s passage and left the chat room.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ah, the guests left……
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Where are you going? You have to keep attacking ㅠㅠ
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -This attack seemed somewhat prepared, but it ended in one blow.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Couldn’t this cost us the first place?
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers watched as the extraterrestrial races left the chat, feeling disappointed.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the universe was vast.
 </p>
 <p>
  -A room with 20 diamonds, I thought it was just a name, but it turned out to be real…!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Stats +100… There must be some trap, but we have to conquer it.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Alone? What a Bold player!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Is he trying to commit suicide?
 </p>
 <p>
  An extraterrestrial race reconnaissance team, attracted by the highly aggro public boss room.
 </p>
 <p>
  -A position with no defense at all, yet ranking 2nd… they’re not to be underestimated.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -The score’s growth rate is astronomical. Lots of players must’ve died here.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -But still, we have to secure the 20 diamonds.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike the initial reconnaissance team, the later ones, upon seeing Seong Jihan now at rank 2, did not lower their guard, but still resolved to invade for those 20 diamonds.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh, a guest has arrived. Another one-shot? ㅋㅋㅋ
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Let’s not chat, They might flee in shock.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Be careful, we can’t have space guests quitting.
 </p>
 <p>
  While viewers self-regulated their comments.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rumble…
 </p>
 <p>
  As the boss room opened,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Real diamonds!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Unaware of Seong Jihan’s power, new intruders entered without proper precautions.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})

 <p>
  Most of them were larger-than-life monster races compared to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Pleased to meet you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan lightly moved his sword, slicing them to pieces.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have leveled up.]
 </p>
 <p>
  He looked at the system message that appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Level… is it 241 now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  He started at 215 and rapidly gained levels over the past 7 days.
 </p>
 <p>
  Normally, in BattleNet games, the experience points settled after the game ended were more significant, but
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps it was because this map was a special dungeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  Or maybe, because he eliminated so many invaders, the level-up speed was quite fast.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The gap with 1st place has significantly narrowed.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan opened the scoreboard to check.
 </p>
 <p>
  1st place – Artemus Legion (Artemus) – 322,140 [Public]
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  2nd place – We have 20 diamonds – 287,220
 </p>
 <p>
  It started with a difference of 190,000, but now it has narrowed down to about 35,000.
 </p>
 <p>
  If this pace continued, claiming the top rank seemed imminent.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems the extraterrestrial races are weaker than expected.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan said so, watching his opponents being unable to withstand a single sweeping move,
 </p>
 <p>
  […All those races were at least mid-to-upper tier. It’s just that the master is unbelievably strong.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel, who’s become Seong Jihan’s sword and dispatched the enemy in one stroke, commented in a weary tone.
 </p>
 <p>
  [What did you do to grow so much stronger? Your growth rate is truly astonishing.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Getting the Void was somewhat useful.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The void… powerful indeed, but dangerously risky. It’s better to avoid it for the future.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, I’m not planning for the far future.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite knowing that void could limit his lifespan, he needed it right now to prepare for the impending battle with the Marital God.
 </p>
 <p>
  That was a concern for another time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Rumble…
 </p>
 <p>
  [Sick of it all.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the boss room door opened once more, Ariel mumbled as if tired of the incessant visitors.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the effective allure of 20 diamonds, guests kept pouring in despite being shattered by Seong Jihan’s attacks.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m getting used to it. There are only a few days left, so I should welcome guests if they come.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The special dungeon that started in early February, entering mid-month without starting the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  The play deadline for this map was until the 24th.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the gap with the 1st place was quickly catching up due to the lure of diamonds,
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  He still couldn’t relax completely.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Welcome~”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan greeted the enemies with a smiling face.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, from the opened door, various races poured out.
 </p>
 <p>
  From large walking trees to fire-made elementals and small goblin-like races.
 </p>
 <p>
  Races that seemed difficult to mix were cooperating with each other.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This time they’re organized.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Originally, they were focused on the diamonds, trying to go first.
 </p>
 <p>
  The extraterrestrial races couldn’t properly unite.
 </p>
 <p>
  But this time, it was as if they were a team, and the order was well-organized.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But it’s silent.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Usually, everyone would get passionate at the sight of stat diamonds, shouting out loud.
 </p>
 <p>
  The current coalition, however, was approaching Seong Jihan without uttering a word.
 </p>
 <p>
  They didn’t even glance at the shining diamonds behind Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  They only revealed their hostility towards the boss of the mid-boss room.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Something seems suspicious.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Feeling something off about their behavior, Seong Jihan decided to quickly eliminate them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzt…
 </p>
 <p>
  A red current surged at the tip of the Phoenix Spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nameless divine art, Fusion of Divine thunder and phoenix: Crimson Thunder cannon
 </p>
 <p>
  The blast pierced the front ranks in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  Chizzt…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The opponent disappeared quickly, not even leaving a corpse.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, even as they died, they didn’t make a single groan.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They seem like undead…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Noticing the same reaction from various races, Seong Jihan expanded his senses without relaxing his tension.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Suuu…
 </p>
 <p>
  A subtle movement flowing above the dungeon’s ceiling caught his senses.
 </p>
 <p>
  It approached the location with diamonds secretly and swiftly.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I almost missed it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If the enemy’s actions hadn’t seemed suspicious, he might have missed the movement.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan quickly flew there and thrust his sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ugh…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The covert movement stopped, and a scream erupted.
 </p>
 <p>
  Suuu…
 </p>
 <p>
  From where the sword was thrust, red smoke emerged.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’re a keen one…]
 </p>
 <p>
  It soon formed a figure.
 </p>
 <p>
  A woman with giant wings and horns.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  Her face, to Seong Jihan,
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -That woman. Could it be…?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Ito Shizuru?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -she is alive??
 </p>
 <p>
  No, it was a familiar face to all the viewers watching this game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ito Shizuru, who caused a great stir in 2020.
 </p>
 <p>
  The stunning beauty who shook the world, and the woman appearing on the screen now, were completely identical.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You… Are you the Succubus Queen?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hooh, how did you know that? Ah, you…”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan recognized her, the Succubus Queen, who was surprised by his knowledge, looked closely at him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That bastard who suppressed my avatar…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  -Succubus Queen…?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Why does she look exactly like Ito Shizuru?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Wow, looking at her again, she’s really beautiful…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Her clothes are almost nonexistent, lol.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -That makes it even better, hehehe.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Succubus Queen appeared, the chat erupted into chaos. Most were amazed by her resemblance to Ito Shizuru and praised her beauty. The chat was filled with comments about her appearance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Succubus Queen, who attempted to retrieve Ito Shizuru’s soul, was sucked into the ‘Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods’.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That wasn’t her real body back then.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Though ‘Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods’ is mighty, it seemed too easy for a being called the Apostle of the Apocalypse to be subdued.
 </p>
 <p>
  It must have been an avatar.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you doing here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehe. I was curious when I heard that a Hideout player was offering diamonds.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re trying to steal the diamonds, aren’t you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There was some intent to do that…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Succubus Queen didn’t exactly deny it and looked at Seong Jihan with a deep, enchanting gaze.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Back then, I thought you were an interesting kid. I didn’t expect you to grow to the point of being assigned to Space 4. This level of growth means we might be evenly matched…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  With those words, her eyes turned pink,
 </p>
 <p>
  and the already enchanting figure endeavored to display even greater presence.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Instant charm, huh…!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan quickly operated his methods.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nameless Divine Arts, Heart Method – Mind Creates All
 </p>
 <p>
  In his past life, the Heart Method played a significant role in suppressing the Succubus Queen. Seong Jihan instantly released the charm and swung his sword at her.
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzt!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Succubus Queen’s body was split in half.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Heehee… good, good. I’m delighted by your resistance. It makes me want you more.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Her body transformed into smoke and reformed, attaching the severed parts. Once again, her pink eyes sparkled towards Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Pleasure, arise.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoooosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Before her words could finish, a pink smoke emerged from the ground, intensifying the charm effect. It was a bewitching dance that amplified the allure.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who was using the Heart Method, furrowed his brows as he witnessed this.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s… much stronger than in my previous life!’
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed that the Succubus Queen summoned to Earth in his previous life wasn’t complete. Although Seong Jihan’s abilities had already surpassed his past life, the charm effect continued to press on him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can’t just let this happen…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Resisting the allure, Seong Jihan quickly thrust his sword into the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thunk!
 </p>
 <p>
  Nameless Divine Arts, Annihilation God’s Secret – Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods.
 </p>
 <p>
  The pattern of Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods swiftly spread across the dungeon floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Could it be… the same as last time…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hurry up and get in.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait a moment! Why is it getting so big!?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Shooosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Succubus Queen’s feet turned into smoke, she began to be drawn towards the pattern of the Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh… To think I’d be absorbed by such a trick…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike her summoned avatar on Earth that faced its demise rather quickly,
 </p>
 <p>
  the Queen resisted the Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods somewhat robustly,
 </p>
 <p>
  “This… It’s illogical! Isn’t it cheating?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swooosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Gradually, her legs disappeared, leaving only the upper body struggling. The Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods had an absolute effect on spirits, and even the Succubus Queen couldn’t withstand it for long.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh… I’m really being drawn in…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm, since it’s the original body, I’ll probably level up, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What? L…Level up?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Succubus Queen grimaced, Seong Jihan confidently announced victory while calmly awaiting leveling up.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Wait…! Stop, Jihan. Please.]
 </p>
 <p>
  In his ear, a familiar voice echoed.
 </p>
 <p>
  No, it used to be familiar.
 </p>
 <p>
  A voice that he couldn’t hear anymore.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Noona?”
 </p>

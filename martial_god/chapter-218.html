  Chapter 218
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘How did the Artemus Legion get here?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Is it possible for other mid-boss rooms to invade other rooms as well?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, with a puzzled expression, opened the scoreboard as he observed the Dwarf Legion.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Artemus Legion, now in second place, just behind the Seong Jihan, still had disclosed information.
 </p>
 <p>
  He examined the opposing boss’ room invaders.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Artemus Legion, annihilate the enemy!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dwarf Legion, engaged in battle with the enemies as usual, appeared to have the same numbers as before. The situation didn’t seem like the boss room was under attack.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Looks like I’ll have to capture and interrogate them.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan easily drew his sword across horizontally.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  Instantly, the Dwarf Legion was split in half. Their hammers, spears, and various weapons were all cleaved in a single strike.
 </p>
 <p>
  -The Artemus Legion used to be first place… I was expecting something different.’
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -The guests this time aren’t very impressive either, are they?’
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Seong Jihan is solidifying his first-place position~’
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers are optimistic about the situation when…
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The bodies of the split Dwarf Legion instantly regenerated. Not only the dwarves but also the weapons were restored.
 </p>
 <p>
  They resumed the battle in the same combat stance, shouting,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Artemus Legion, annihilate the enemy!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Artemus Legion advanced in unison. Their momentum wasn’t exceptionally strong compared to the enemies who had attacked Seong Jihans mid-boss room so far.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shick!
 </p>
 <p>
  Even after Seong Jihan’s sword struck them several times, they regenerated and rushed at him again.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘These guys didn’t earn first place for nothing.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Players belonging to the same Space 4. They were not to be underestimated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan used the Total Annihilation Horizontal Sweep while carefully observing the enemy’s regeneration.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike the monstrous regeneration of the elves, these enemies seemed to function differently.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The weapons are suspicious.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The restoration order was different from the dwarves; the weapons came first before the dwarves.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan reached out with his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  A small black vortex formed, sucking up all the weapons of the dwarf vanguard.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘About S-rank in quality.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps because dwarves used these weapons, the sizes were like toys. However, the quality itself was not bad.
 </p>
 <p>
  It couldn’t be compared to Eclipse or Phoenix Flag, but they were reasonably S-rank.
 </p>
 <p>
  He concentrated on examining the weapons and then lit up his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There’s a peculiar aura hidden inside.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In terms of attributes, it was close to light. A faint aura was hidden inside the weapon, around the handle area.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although he had gathered various auras until now, this kind was new, especially for light attributes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shuuuu…
 </p>
 <p>
  A palm-sized black vortex formed, absorbing all the light aura from the weapons.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Artemus Legion…]
 </p>
 <p>
  The dwarves who robustly cheered for the Artemus Legion stopped moving, standing still in place as if the machine had halted its function.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, facing the vanguard unit in that state, once again swung his sword horizontally.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  Shwaaak!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dwarf Legion, split in half and falling to the ground. Unlike before, these turned into light without showcasing remarkable regeneration, writhing on the ground and disappearing.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Indeed, this hidden light aura and regenerative effect were related.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Well then, let’s delve deeper into this unfamiliar aura.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan wanted to create an even larger Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  The Artemus Legion that had been charging at him was already retreating towards the entrance.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where do you think you’re going?”
 </p>
 <p>
  They might enter on their own accord, but leaving isn’t up to them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s hand moved to obtain the light energy when.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The weapons and armor of the dwarf legion floated in the air, starting to cluster together wildly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clunk! Clunk!
 </p>
 <p>
  Hundreds, thousands of gears clumped in an instant. What took shape was…
 </p>
 <p>
  A massive steel giant glistening white with light from various angles.
 </p>
 <p>
  -A robot?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Even combined robots are coming out
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Is this the true form of Artemus?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -I felt there was something, but the weapons were the main body…
 </p>

 </div>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -We didn’t realize in the public video, but now that it’s in front of Seong Jihan, its true nature is revealed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewing this, the audience recalled the image of a combined robot.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike the typical steel giant, this one was decorated rather elegantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  [In Space 4, a super rookie has appeared.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you Artemus?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzing…
 </p>
 <p>
  A burst of white light erupted from Artemus’s chest, and all the dwarves were instantly sucked into it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, the body of Artemus sparkled even more.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Quite a force.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even as the Seong Jihan, he felt a formidable power that couldn’t be ignored. With this level of opponent, it wouldn’t be easy to eliminate them in one blow.
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzt…
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Seong Jihan properly prepared for the battle against Artemus, raising his power.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Wait. I have no intention of fighting.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Clank!
 </p>
 <p>
  The amalgamated steel giant spread its palm, indicating that it had no intention to fight.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, Seong Jihan intensified his aura even further.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  The light aura possessed by the giant was something he had never seen before, sparking his curiosity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzzzing…
 </p>
 <p>
  As red currents emanated from Seong Jihan’s body, he felt the urge to collect this unfamiliar energy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzzzing…
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan prepared for battle, raising his power, Artemus shook its hands, signaling a lack of intent to fight.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Not battle! Negotiate. I want to negotiate, Hideout player.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Negotiation?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. In the 1st place reward of this special dungeon, if Hellfire Crystals come out, sell them to me.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sell them? I don’t need GP.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [No need for GP… must be nice to have money. Fine then.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Artemus pointed at the Phoenix Flag in Seong Jihan’s hand with his finger and blinked.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Then, instead of GP, I will upgrade your weapon.]
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  -He seems desperate not to fight, even though he looks like a giant monster ready to battle.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  LOL, maybe he got scared.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -What’s this about weapon upgrade? Isn’t the Phoenix Flag SSS-grade?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Exactly lolol
 </p>
 <p>
  While viewers mocked Artemus for desperately avoiding combat, others expressed surprise.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Artemus is not only revealing its true form but also offering a weapon upgrade…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Upgrade weapon?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -What’s the Hellfire Crystal, and why does Artemus want it?
 </p>
 <p>
  The extraterrestrial race remaining in Seong Jihan’s channel reacted with great astonishment.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan glanced at the chat and eased his momentum.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If it’s SSS-rank, will you make it into EX?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [No. Even if I were the best blacksmith in the universe, that would be impossible. But I can enhance it.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That spear, you attached an intangible weapon to it, right?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ve got a keen eye. That’s correct.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [In my view, it’s not completely harmonized yet. With a little touch, its performance will greatly improve.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The upgraded Phoenix Flag combined with the Divine thunder. Recognizing it at a glance, it didn’t seem like the work of an amateur.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hellfire Crystal is what I need as the best blacksmith. It won’t be useful for you. Isn’t this a good deal for you?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, whether it’s useful for me or not, I’ll have to try it out after receiving the item.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hmm… then, I’ll give you two more Artemus’s Blacksmith Workshop vouchers for the upgrade.]
 </p>
 <p>
  -Blacksmith Workshop vouchers too?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Artemus… is that serious about the crystal!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Our race doesn’t have any crystals… too bad!
 </p>
 <p>
  The extraterrestrial race chatted excitedly about Artemus’s earnestness.
 </p>
 <p>
  -What are these aliens talking about? LOL.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Let’s learn a bit from them -_-.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -They’re just having fun among themselves. LOL.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Is Artemus some kind of a skilled blacksmith?
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers were able to guess Artemus’s standing as a craftsman from their reactions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… I’ll think about it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Don’t think too much… the crystal will be useless for you! How about cooperating with a fellow small race?]
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  “A small race?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes! I watched your channel, and you seem to be of human origin. You know, a lower-tier race compared to our Dwarves?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You were a Dwarf?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s right.]
 </p>
 <p>
  -They were Dwarves, these guys?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Fantasy races are all coming out.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -But why do these guys always call us the lowest of the low?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -On BattleNet, it does seem like we are the lowest of the low, but LOL, now it’s like a monster feast in Space League.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Even the combined robot looks like it will just get beaten if another player tries to fight it, LOL.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Calling us the lowest of the low, they don’t seem like monsters like elves, but…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, the Dwarves had their peculiarities.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like their bodies and weapons would regenerate as if time had reversed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering the weapon was the actual core, and it had even become a combined robot.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Wait, is this Artemus’s characteristic?’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan cautiously observed Artemus, he said,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Oh, right. Did you also stay on BattleNet to improve your race? In that case, as a senior, I can give you advice. There’s an optimal route for what options to buy for the lowest-tier races.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether out of a sense of kinship due to being from a weaker race, the talkative giant robot seemed somewhat amiable.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Seong Jihan caught on to something else in Artemus’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…You stayed on BattleNet?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. I couldn’t give up the benefits.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “How can you leave?”
 </p>
 <p>
  […Don’t they give you the option after winning three times in the Bronze League? You should know if you’ve won at least once.]
 </p>
 <p>
  -Really?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Three wins and you’re free?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Oh… robots are useful.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -He’s revealing so much valuable information.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -But wouldn’t it be regrettable if BattleNet disappeared? We’re living for the thrill of watching this, LOL.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Oh my? What if dungeons appear in front of our homes?
 </p>
 <p>
  The chat exploded upon hearing the conditions for liberation from BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was also secretly surprised, but he didn’t show it on his face and casually said,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’d have to win to know.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You… don’t tell me… a rookie? Impossible. There’s a player from Space 4 who’s a newbie?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Artemus shook its head in disbelief and then.
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzing!
 </p>
 <p>
  Laser beams shot from the giant robot’s eyes, and a huge screen appeared in the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  From there, unreadable characters emerged.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Oh, it’s true. A new race has been added to BattleNet betting… The evaluation says that they will be eliminated.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you looking at the betting site report?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. Hmm… you’re not just a Super Rookie. You are a divine being… destined to shine even more brightly among the constellations…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Artemus flicked three fingers.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Alright. Then, I’ll give you three blacksmith workshop vouchers! Although it’s regrettable for the Hellfire Crystal, I’ll support the hope of the lower-tier race!]
 </p>
 <p>
  With an incredibly bitter tone, Artemus spoke, supporting the giant robot’s story.
 </p>
 <p>
  This deal seemed acceptable.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan was pondering for a moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, may I also inquire if it’s possible for me?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Enhancement?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel, who had been silent in the form of the Shadow Eclipse, spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Indeed. If the Eclipse is enhanced further, it will produce remarkable results.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Asking wasn’t difficult.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan showed Artemus the sword and asked, “Can this sword be enhanced?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [This is the Shadow Sword…]
 </p>
 <p>
  — Zzzing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Laser beams scanned the shadow sword after emerging from Artemus’s gaze.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Such abundant authority of the Shadow is in here. Your sponsor constellation is Shadow Queen, ain’t she?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “No.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Not even from the sponsor constellation, yet you’ve been given so much authority? Odd… Enhancement won’t be easy. Unless you have part of the Shadow Queen herself, perhaps a finger.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you need a finger or body part for?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Shadow Queen is the essence of shadow. Even a hair would be a good material… Anyway, I need at least one finger to evolve further.]
 </p>
 <p>
  This was a barbaric method, to put a finger in the weapon’s evolution.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Even the Queen should be able to do that. She says it’s possible.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…You’re giving a finger?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [If it regenerates, it’s fine, isn’t it?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel spoke confidently, perhaps hinting towards something more.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Could she… actually be the queen?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite Ariel’s assertive attitude regarding the severing of a finger…
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the sword suspiciously.
 </p>

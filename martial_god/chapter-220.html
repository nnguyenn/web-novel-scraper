  Chapter 220
 </p>
 <p>
  In the guild office of the Sword Palace.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s really been a long time since I’ve seen you, Boss.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon, with dark circles heavily under her eyes, greeted Seong Jihan with a tired face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Since you’re here, I’ll leave early today…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sure. Go rest too, Gayeong.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes……”
 </p>
 <p>
  With documents in hand, Lim Gayeong, also worn out, opened the door to the lounge next to the guild master’s office and collapsed onto the bed inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is it okay for a bodyguard to be like this?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked incredulously towards the resting room, whose door had not been shut.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Lee Hayeon defended her.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Gayeong stayed up for me for a few nights. Boss, please understand.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, I see. But what happened? Why are things so busy?”Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  “What happened… you ask?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sigh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon sighed deeply.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Since joining the original game where the BattleNet went to hell, the level cap was expanded.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “And from the world’s first rankers, all the top-tier players have entered their growth phase again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh-huh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now everyone is trying to get into the Daegi guild. The promising spots have already been replaced by rankers, and they are calling from all around asking if there are any spots left, pestering with requests and even threats.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thump! thump! thump!
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon walked to the desk in the guild master’s office and hammered on the keyboard.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, Lee Hayeon’s emails appeared on the monitor screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There, personally, I am getting sweet offers from everywhere. The Americans are saying they will give me 100 Akashic pages if I go there. The Chinese offered 80.”
 </p>
 <p>
  An email from Robert Gates of the American First.
 </p>
 <p>
  The email contained an eye-watering salary amount and an offer to support with Akashic pages on a national level.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The value of nurturing ability is being recognized quite a bit.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Various guilds around the world are actively operating support gifts for nurturing talent.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the number of nurturing ability users were still scarce, though Seong Jihan had lowered the difficulty level of the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  Therefore, each guild had no choice but to look towards Lee Hayeon, the existing top talent.
 </p>
 <p>
  “And I’ve even received offers from all directions due to the bombshell tasks. They’re saying I can just relax in Hawaii and they’ll take care of everything.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm. Hayeon, didn’t you want to showcase your abilities? If you want, I can help you with that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No. Well… I just don’t like to be idle. But…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon pointed at her back with her finger.
 </p>
 <p>
  Behind her was a mountain-like pile of documents, half covering the window of the guild master’s office.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t want to just work here and die!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon seemed like she might actually quit and run away.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to sort out the guild tasks.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So what’s the exact problem? I thought I gave you full authority.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Authority… right. I do have the authority over all guild tasks. But…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon stood up briskly from her spot and brought documents from behind her.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was application forms from players who wished to join the Daegi guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon laid them out one by one on the desk.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Look at this. All the world rankers have submitted applications. Every single one without exception! Even the rankers from the Chinese People’s Association, who had a big clash with you, have all submitted applications. It’s not collusion or anything, it’s just…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  From world rank 1 to 100.
 </p>
 <p>
  No, including rankings beyond that, every player has submitted applications to join the Daegi guild without exception.
 </p>
 <p>
  And that’s not all.
 </p>
 <p>
  The guilds where they originally belonged and even the national BattleNet associations had sent official documents urging cooperation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is more than the guild master can handle alone.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The situation where the superpowers, the United States and China, joined forces to request the inclusion of their players.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if Lee Hayeon delegated authority from Seong Jihan, it was still too much for one person to handle.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Taking out the promising player from American First and putting in the 1st rank, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. That’s how Oliver, the 1st rank from the United States, became a member of our guild. However, the positions that couldn’t be resolved are still causing trouble.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It was all well and good to switch a prospect with a core player in their own guilds.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the biggest issue was the allocation of places allotted to other guilds.
 </p>
 <p>
  Arguments continued to clash between those who argued for redistributing the Daegi guild’s growth effects to high rankers for the sake of humanity and those who insisted they couldn’t give up their share.
 </p>
 <p>
  “These people really… acting as if they’ve reserved spots.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right. Even though they are quite formidable, it’s too much for me to handle. At first, I thought they were minding your gaze, but lately, ever since you stopped interfering with the guild… it’s gotten worse.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon pointed at herself.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have also seen increasing attempts to recruit me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you planning to go?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, I might prefer going to Hawaii than just working to death.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon, with eyes half-closed and staggering, spoke carelessly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan felt the need to sort things out swiftly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Otherwise, she might actually leave.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright. I’ll handle it right away. First of all.”
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Snap!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan snapped his fingers.
 </p>
 <p>
  The application forms piled up on the desk and by the window turned into dust and disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Cut all the guild members brought from other guilds. Let’s just keep… Yes, me and Seah. My brother-in-law, Sophia, Masied, and Barren as well. And leave those assigned to your share, like Gayeong.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Regarding my share, Gayeong is the only one. But you say you’ve cut the rest…… Oh, Barren was left?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “His gift is excellent. He has value worth nurturing for the sake of humanity.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren, who used to lead the world rankings in the previous life.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although he was a bit arrogant, his status windows with two gifts were truly outstanding.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  He was a talent worth cultivating in the long run.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But if we do cut them like this, complaints are going to start coming in from all sides…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Lee Hayeon. Remember this. We are the superiors here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But still, the opposition is the United States and China, you know?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If they keep bothering us, just say I’ll boycott the Space League.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon blinked.
 </p>
 <p>
  Oh, right.
 </p>
 <p>
  That was Seong Jihan’s position.
 </p>
 <p>
  A player who had become a core player for humanity in less than a year since his awakening.
 </p>
 <p>
  If not for his premonition during the last Space League game, many players would have been executed.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wouldn’t be a big deal for most players.
 </p>
 <p>
  But if Seong Jihan declares that he will no longer participate in the Space League if his guild is disrupted, that would carry a significant weight.
 </p>
 <p>
  “And from now on, every month, they say they will randomly select a player from the top 200 players in the world rankings to bring into the guild.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Random… selection?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. The chosen person will be allowed to stay as a guild member for a month, receiving a reasonable amount of money.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “And next month, you chase them out again and pick new ones?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. That’s the plan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The players originally affiliated might resist…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll just pay a penalty to kick them out. I made some money this time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swooosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan revealed his GP balance in his status window to Lee Hayeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…1…100 billion GP?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There are many wealthy people in the Space League.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The GP exchange rate that was $1 during the tutorial.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since the opening of the Space League, it had fluctuated but was currently around $2.5.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  What’s the value of 100 billion GP?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘And it keeps increasing…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps because Hidden Boss Seong Jihan was active throughout the universe, the GP number continued to rise.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon, now wide awake, looked at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Boss.. With this much, do you really need to run the guild?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m running the guild mainly for the growth bonus. You can take all the money the guild earns.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Me, all of it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, how much do you want?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan seemed utterly indifferent about how much the guild made.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Recruit more people. Spend money freely. I can sell as much as I want too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Still, how am I supposed to…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s better for Lee Hayeon to take a flight to Hawaii due to overwork than to work until you die.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With that assertion, Seong Jihan opened the guild management window in the system.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then I’ll start cutting the guild members.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah……”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s fingers moved nimbly.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The player ‘Oliver’ has been expelled from the guild.]
 </p>
 <p>
  In front of Lee Hayeon, a guild system message appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  The world’s number one, Oliver from the United States, was first to be expelled from the guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  Following him, all players were successively expelled from the Daegi guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Buzz buzz buzz…
 </p>
 <p>
  Multiple phones belonging to Lee Hayeon started vibrating everywhere.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hello? Have you been expelled from the guild? Please wait a moment. Let me confirm.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even in the office outside the guild master’s room, the sound of phones ringing incessantly spread.
 </p>
 <p>
  Immediate reactions came in response to Seong Jihan’s expulsion of all his guild members.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……The response from these people is really fast.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Tell those contacting you to watch the guild BattleTube.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “BattleTube?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Let’s turn on the guild BattleTube, which we haven’t for a long time. I’ll make a clear announcement about this incident.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After expelling all the guild members and not long after the official BattleTube was played, it contained announcements regarding the guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  -All players in the Daegi guild got expelled?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -What the heck happened?
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers, already hearing about the recent developments, started flocking to the channel.

 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  “……Therefore, from now on, the Daegi guild will change its method of selecting guild members to all random.”
 </p>
 <p>
  -Pure random, wow, this is a big change.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -How many slots does the Daegi guild have?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -With the expansion of the number of people allocated to the top 10 guilds… subtracting the remaining people, it would be around 50-60 slots, right?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Roughly a 1/4 probability.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -If that’s the case, wouldn’t it be better to just cut based on world rankings?
 </p>
 <p>
  In the Daegi guild office, Seong Jihan declared a sudden change in the method of selecting guild members.
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers’ reactions were divided in various ways in response to his statement. Many questioned why they wouldn’t just cut based on rankings.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Because then certain countries would get too many benefits. We’ll go with a random selection.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Since most players in the top 50 are from the United States and China, Seong Jihan opted for a pure random selection to avoid concentrating waiting guild slots in just those two countries.
 </p>
 <p>
  He added, “Oh, and stop sending recruitment offers to our guild master. If you send one more email, our guild won’t accept it. Especially, be careful, American First.”
 </p>
 <p>
  -He called out American First lol
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -As expected of Seong Jihan… not even caring about the world’s top-ranked guild.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -The one who should be nervous is them, why would he be? lol
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan sent a clear warning to stop sending recruitment offers to Lee Hayeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  [R.E.GATES has sponsored 100,000 GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Understood, Mr. Seong Jihan. We won’t make any more offers.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Immediately, a sponsorship message appeared on the guild’s BattleTube window.
 </p>
 <p>
  Robert Gates, one of the major stakeholders in American First, promptly expressed his apologies.
 </p>
 <p>
  -He’s bowing down immediately, wow.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Is the Daegi guild that much superior…?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -In terms of growth, there’s nowhere better. There’s no comparison.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -After entering the Space League, even China is trying hard to amend their relationship with the Daegi guild lol
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -They thought they could bully people, now they wonder if the tide was going to turn like this lol
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Ah. So if the player from the People’s Association is randomly selected, will you take them, Mr. Seong Jihan?
 </p>
 <p>
  Players from the People’s Association, essentially boycotted from the Daegi guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  If they randomly selected one from the top 200, a player from the People’s Association would inevitably be chosen.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm… they did behave in a way that annoyed me. However, China has many key players.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With the Space League already open,
 </p>
 <p>
  It was necessary to promote the growth of Chinese players with SSS-gifts to enhance humanity’s overall strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  But it wouldn’t be right to simply accept them without addressing the past incident.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Right. I’ll get something out of it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan slowly stirred the waters.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The People’s Association… Since there’s bad blood between us, I don’t intend to pick them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  -Seriously, don’t pick them. Who knows if they’ll stab you in the back?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -But then, players like Je Galheon or Wang Lin should be nurtured for the Space League, shouldn’t they?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Player Seong Jihan, I urge you to make a decisive decision. The Space League matches are about to take place; do you intend to exclude 1/5 of humanity?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Yes, please consider the greater good!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Seong Jihan, think about justice!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Oops, someone just marked his spot lol
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Oh, there are a lot of Chinese flags in the ID now.
 </p>
 <p>
  With IDs displaying Chinese flags pouring in, the chat window began to flood.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  Seeing that, Seong Jihan chuckled and opened his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Having said that, considering we moved into the Space League… It doesn’t quite feel right to exclude an entire nation… if only one condition is met, I’ll accept Chinese players.”
 </p>
 <p>
  -The condition?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -What is it?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -You’re really going to accept people from the People’s Association to the Daegi guild?
 </p>
 <p>
  The chat room, filled with Chinese flags, promptly inquired.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The condition is… selected as the ‘Guild of the Year’ by the World BattleNet Association. If the Daegi guild is chosen for this, I’ll accept the People’s Association too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan finally mentioned the condition, those who were flooding the chat with demands for a decisive decision fell silent for a moment.

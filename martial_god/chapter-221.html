  Chapter 221
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow, aiming for the Guild of the Year… That’s a big move.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Is the Guild of the Year that important?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -If selected, you get a +7 boost to all guild options lol. It’s totally overpowered.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ‘Guild of the Year’ award, selected once a year by the World BattleNet Association, endowed an immense benefit of granting a +7 level increase to all guild options including [Guild Member Expansion], [Stat Increase], and [Growth Rate Increase].
 </p>
 <p>
  Due to this powerful effect, strong disputes arose in many countries over the Guild of the Year.
 </p>
 <p>
  The World BattleNet Association didn’t allow a specific Guild to be selected consecutively for the Guild of the Year.
 </p>
 <p>
  If American First was selected this year, they couldn’t be selected next year, and another Guild would take their place.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wasn’t American First the Guild of the Year last time?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Yeah, it’s probably the turn for the People’s Association this time.
 </p>
 <p>
  And so, with this system in place, the honor of the Guild of the Year was alternately shared between the overwhelming American First and the People’s Association, considering their Guild sizes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Apart from them, there were no Guilds worthy of being selected as the Guild of the Year.
 </p>
 <p>
  Last year, American First was the Guild of the Year, so it was supposed to be the People’s Association’s turn this year.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Guild of the Year. If we go by size, indeed the People’s Association should be chosen. But let’s think ‘generously’ as you all like. The Daegi guild as the paragon of nurturing guilds. Here, if we get +7 options and accept 35 more players, Earth’s players’ strength will grow much faster.”
 </p>
 <p>
  While saying that, Seong Jihan smacked his hands together as if he had just realized something.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh! And the growth rate will increase too. If the growth rate in the nurturing guild gets +7 added… How effective would that be for nurturing players? For the greater good, how about selecting us as the Guild of the Year?”
 </p>
 <p>
  -Generous, For greater good indeed. He’s throwing back the same words the Chinese were saying lol
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -But for real, if the Daegi guild is nurturing all the world’s rankers, isn’t it right to support them?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Exactly. Players need to grow quickly to fight the space monsters.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Won’t those in the TOP 200 also have an increased chance of being picked?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -But when will they announce it?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -It’s on March 1st, lol.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Not much time left, lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  As of late February, the current date, there wasn’t much time left until the Guild of the Year selection.
 </p>
 <p>
  Calculating the dates, Seong Jihan said, “On March 2nd, I will do a random draw broadcast. Whether all 200 rankers will participate in the draw or not… we can know that the day before.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan definitively set the date for the guild member drawing to be right after the selection for the Guild of the Year.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then. I’ll look forward to a wise choice.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, Seong Jihan passed the ball to the Chinese side and turned off the BattleTube broadcast.
 </p>
 <p>
  And, of course, as soon as the broadcast ended that day, the news spread like wildfire throughout the entire BattleNet industry.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially, the place where the situation went crazy was on the side of the People’s Association.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  People’s Association conference room.
 </p>
 <p>
  The People’s Association executives looked at Seong Jihan’s broadcast with distorted faces.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That brazen guy… he dares to ask for the Guild of the Year?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This has crossed the line!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right. If we miss Guild of the Year this time, it could be a bad sign for challenging the Champions League.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Guild of the Year effect, which boosts all Guild options to +7, had brought tremendous power-ups to China’s national representative players. This was because +7 to all stats was a considerable enhancement.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We have already decided the list of 35 players to be promoted to the main team. To challenge for victory in the Champions League, they must receive the Guild of the Year effects for the People’s Association’s main team.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Without the enhancement of the stats for these 35 players, we will lose against the United States in the decisive battle.”
 </p>
 <p>
  China’s all-out effort was concentrated on the People’s Association’s main team. Having 35 more players entering and receiving stat enhancement effects was a tremendous advantage.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, according to Seong Jihan’s request, accepting 35 additional members seemed impossible. From China’s perspective, aiming for the Champions League victory this year, it was an offer that was hard to accept.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But thinking about the future, it’s regrettable to give up the growth effect of the Daegi Guild…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sigh! Out of 1.3 billion people, isn’t there a gifted person with nurturing gift? Why does Korea have an SS-level nurturer?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The most outstanding one was only B-grade. I reinforced him up to A-grade through the Akashic Page, but breaking through the wall to S was challenging.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The difference is quite significant, isn’t it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Even top players often experience natural growth in stats. The world’s number one, Oliver, expressed surprise when his stats increased by 3.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well. If players from other countries all grow rapidly in the Daegi Guild, and we are left behind…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “By next year, the gap in growth among the top-ranking players could become significant.”
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  However, rejecting the Daegi guild’s offer seemed too valuable considering their nurturing ability.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not only for the prospects but also the existing top-tier players were reaping the growth rate increase benefits of the Daegi guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  The value of the Daegi guild was skyrocketing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How about we bring over the Daegi guild master Lee Hayeon? Her ability must be the most crucial.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “She is the lover of Seong Jihan. She is the practical owner of the guild.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We tried already, but even when we offered 80 more Akashic pages, she flatly refused.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “And didn’t Seong Jihan just tell us not to approach her in the broadcast? Knowing his character, if we approach and fail, our relationship with the Daegi guild will be completely severed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha. It’s humiliating to have to answer to that punk.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Suffering the indignity of groveling before a single player.
 </p>
 <p>
  While resenting Zhang Shuzhong for causing trouble last time, the People’s Association executives continued to strategize.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do the players ranked in the TOP 200 think?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They are strongly criticizing Seong Jihan and the Daegi guild. But mostly, they seem upset about missing out on the growth power.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The latter would be their real feelings.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, it might be… especially in the case of Je Galheon, who fell three places in the rankings, his reaction was quite sharp.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did he fall that much?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The faces of the People’s Association officials became serious.
 </p>
 <p>
  To be pushed back like this after a few months?
 </p>
 <p>
  At this rate, after a year or two, the growth gap might become insurmountable.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…On the BattleNet, top players are the most important. We can’t let them fall behind.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If that’s the case…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s give up on the Guild of the Year, but in return, ask the Daegi guild to ensure our 35 spots.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pride and practicality.
 </p>
 <p>
  Between the two, the People’s Association chose the latter while gritting their teeth.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Boss… Just when I thought I could finally take a break, I received an urgent call from the People’s Association.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon, who just went to the restroom thinking she could finally relax after the BattleTube broadcast, contacted Seong Jihan again after a while.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do they say?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They said they’ll give up on the Guild of the Year, but in return want 35 spots for themselves.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “35 spots… that’s quite greedy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “In return, they promise to support us next year to be selected as Guild of the Year again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Next year?”
 </p>
 <p>
  If this year belonged to the People’s Association, then next year would be for American First.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They’ve played their hand well.’
 </p>
 <p>
  They’re probably arguing that since we’re giving up this year, America should too.
 </p>
 <p>
  I could indeed sense this drowning-man mindset.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t it impossible for a guild to be selected as Guild of the Year for two years in a row?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They’re willing to make an exception for the Daegi Guild and fully support it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… Well, that’s not a problem with the BattleNet system but rather a rule set by the BattleNet Association.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems that way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Changing regulations to be the Guild of the Year two years in a row.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That doesn’t sound bad.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The People’s Association must’ve made such an argument, thinking it’s better to give it to the Daegi guild again rather than giving it to American First.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, their proposition was favorable for Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright. Let’s allocate around 20 spots to the People’s Association, including those conditions.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “20… is that the maximum we’ll negotiate for?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Once the number is settled through negotiation, I’ll publicly announce that we’ll transfer some guild member spots to the side giving up Guild of the Year.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I see… Alright. I’ll negotiate with the People’s Association based on that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Their relationship with the People’s Association had been quite adversarial, but American First had been relatively friendly towards him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Yesterday’s enemies can become today’s allies.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Limited to this ‘Guild of the Year’ issue, it seemed best to exploit the People’s Association appropriately.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s ultimate goal was to liberate Earth from the BattleNet game.
 </p>
 <p>
  For that purpose, the Daegi guild—where he belonged—needed to keep holding the reins of development,
 </p>
 <p>
  and the ‘Guild of the Year’ was a key point to strengthen that leadership.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Lee Hayeon, please take care of the negotiation this one last time. Then you can take as long a vacation as you want afterward.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Vacation…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon muttered those words as if in a daze, gazing at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Boss, aren’t you going on vacation?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have to level up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But Hidden Boss is already earning you experience points.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That is true, but I still need to do personal training.”
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  “No, people need some rest too…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I consider training as my rest.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon looked at Seong Jihan with a sickened face.
 </p>
 <p>
  A person training all day long and participating in BattleNet…
 </p>
 <p>
  What kind of machine is he?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, okay. While we’re at it, I should take a break.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Are you going to train?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. I’ve been neglecting it for a while because I was clearing special dungeon map. I’ll go up for now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After bidding farewell to Lee Hayeon, Seong Jihan left the Guild Master’s room to train. Lee Hayeon blinked her eyes, staring fixedly at his retreating figure.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment, Lim Gayeong, who had been in the restroom, came out.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Miss, why did you ask about a vacation?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, I just…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you perhaps want to ask if you could go on vacation with Seong Jihan?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What? What are you saying? Are you crazy?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It might be better to be straightforward next time. Like Sophia.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I didn’t mean that!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You could just tell him that you ought to go on a trip as a couple with him, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… really, it’s not like that!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you sure?.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Smirk!
 </p>
 <p>
  Lim Gayeong grinned with a meaningful smile as Lee Hayeon shouted with a flush red face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh… Hey, just do your job!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sure, sure.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lim Gayeong raised the documents again, thinking to herself.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Leaving it like this, it seems it’ll stay the same for a hundred years…’
 </p>
 <p>
  After overcoming an addiction to gambling with strong determination, Seong Jihan couldn’t even take a single step forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Maybe I should help her.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Gayeong looked at Lee Hayeon with determination, making up her mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile,
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was about to head home, intending to visit his Void Training Room,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoooosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  He felt the shadow energy intensify on his left arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master. I have returned.]
 </p>
 <p>
  After speaking with Artemus,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel, who had claimed she’d need some time to seek the Queen’s finger, went off the grid.
 </p>
 <p>
  She had said it might take a while,
 </p>
 <p>
  But in no time at all, she manifested her presence again.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You came back quickly. Did the Queen not give her finger?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [No, she did]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Already?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pong!
 </p>
 <p>
  A slender, black index finger popped out from Seong Jihan’s left arm. The shadow emanating from it clearly indicated that it was an authentic finger.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…How could the permission have been so swiftly granted?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Dealing with the Shadow Queen usually took a few days, at least.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you really not the queen?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I am not!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why was the finger just ready to detach like that? Be honest, it’s all clear now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [No! It’s just that the queen has high expectations for you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sure, Your Majesty.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Initially surprised, Ariel gave up. Seong Jihan already halfway believed that she was the Shadow Queen.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Inventory.”
 </p>
 <p>
  From his inventory, Seong Jihan took out the horn Artemus had given him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The universe’s finest blacksmith…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Artemus introduced himself as a combination robot of the dwarf race.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should check out his skills.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He blew the horn.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Hell Devil Palace Crystal’ is in possession of the player.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Inviting player to the forge of Artemus.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s silhouette disappeared, enveloped in light.
 </p>

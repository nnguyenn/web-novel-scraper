  Chapter 224
 </p>
 <p>
  “The People’s Association is giving up on this year’s Guild…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is unbelievable.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How did they negotiate with the Daegi Guild, of all guilds?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Representatives of prominent guilds from various countries exchanged surprised glances.
 </p>
 <p>
  The People’s Association.
 </p>
 <p>
  Famous for being the second-ranked guild in the world, directly operated by the Chinese government, and known for its strong pride.
 </p>
 <p>
  No one considered that they would readily accept the conditions proposed by Seong Jihan, despite his current peerless status and the alluring growth potential of the Daegi guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The People’s Association, they have been openly declaring that they are going to win the Champions League to coincide with the opening of the Space League this year.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Handing over the Guild of the Year to the Daegi guild will set off a red signal even for their challenge in the Champions League…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow, this really is an unexpected turn of events.”
 </p>
 <p>
  There existed a definite but not huge gap in the strength of the players between the USA and China.
 </p>
 <p>
  During even-numbered years when American First claimed the Guild of the Year title, China struggled in the Champions League, unable to defeat the USA regardless of effort.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, in odd-numbered years when the People’s Association took the title, China managed to edge out the competition against the USA and claimed the Champions League title several times.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus in 2021, coinciding with the inauguration of the Space League, China declared boldly that they would take major victories in the first year.
 </p>
 <p>
  But handing over the Guild of the Year to the Daegi guild meant resigning their stronghold on the Champions League as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha… We naturally assumed Chinese players would be excluded.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The player drafting happening tomorrow is going to see some new twists.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Guild representatives holding the top 200 players all wore serious expressions. Excluding the People’s Association and their players from the selection, everyone expected the player selection to proceed as usual. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  However, if negotiations had taken place between the Daegi Guild and the People’s Association, it might mean a reduction in the chances for American First.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If we oppose the Daegi guild’s selection as the Guild of the Year…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then like the People’s Association was excluded, our guilds may be excluded too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Besides, if the Daegi guild is included as the Guild of the Year, it will increase the number of random players getting drafted.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s no reason to oppose.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Up to this point, the reactions of the other powerful guild representatives were of the sort: ‘It’s unexpected, but not bad.’
 </p>
 <p>
  But then.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Furthermore… I propose to abolish the regulation that the Guild of the Year cannot be vested consecutively and to exempt the Daegi guild from this regulation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The People’s Association representative dropped another bombshell.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you mean by abolishing the non-consecutive clause! Offering such a privilege to just one guild! Does it mean that the Daegi guild could be nominated again next year?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The representative from American First stood up in shock, to which the representative from the People’s Association looked back at him fiercely.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, that’s right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  We won’t be the only ones suffering.
 </p>
 <p>
  You too should stay away from the Guild of the Year, stated the underlying tit-for-tat mindset in the proposal of the People’s Association.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite this, the representative elegantly couched his argument.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Look at the rankings of humanity included in the Space League. Despite leading the first match to victory, We are currently in 10th place. The last among the races that won a game.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After winning the first match against the Elves, humanity became co-first. However, due to the fewer points earned by playing games on BattleNet compared to other races, their rank steadily dropped. As of March, they were in 10th place.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is not the time to fight among ourselves. We need to nurture players and increase points earned from outside sources. For this, we need to change the Association’s regulations.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He argued that the Daegi guild should be supported for a while to make players stronger.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having made a vicarious argument for the other side and retaking his seat, the People’s Association representative left the other guild leaders agape.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha… I never imagined the representative of the People’s Association would say that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It does appear to be a counteraction against American First…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That high and mighty representative is now acting as a spokesperson for other guilds. You really do see everything if you live long enough.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The representatives began to seriously consider the proposal of the People’s Association.
 </p>
 <p>
  “… His intentions may seem dubious, but his argument isn’t wrong. Indeed, when compared to other races, there’s a noticeable difference in humanity’s daily point earnings.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s true. How much stronger are these other species…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “In fact, if the elves had utilized their full strength, it wouldn’t have been surprising to lose 3:0. The strange actions they took to try and execute us ended up providing us with a chance to turn the tide.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Plus, players belonging to the Daegi guild definitely suffer less from defeat penalties. It’s evident there’s a significant difference in growth rates between players affiliated with the Daegi guild and those who are not.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The experience gain buff they have is substantial.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though the maximum level in BattleNet expanded to 250 over two months of entering the main game, not many players achieved considerable growth.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  The reason being the penalty for not ranking in the upper 50 percent had become harsher than before.
 </p>
 <p>
  One wrong move in the level-up race could lead to demotion rather than progression in this punishing high-level game environment.
 </p>
 <p>
  The lifeline for this issue was the various growth buffs offered by the Daegi guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, the developmental gap between players in the Daegi guild and those not was more severe than people thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  “While it’s a bit much for the Daegi guild to monopolize the Guild of the Year, but…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Until another guild with comparable growth potential emerges, wouldn’t it be appropriate to temporarily, say, a few years, confer the Guild of the Year?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right. Even if the Daegi guild is the Guild of the Year for a few more years, it’s not like Korea will win the Champions League, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You never know what Seong Jihan might do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Haha, is that so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Anyway, if the number of slots increases in Daegi Guild, there will be more space for their players. While other prominent guild representatives positively reacted to the People’s Association’s proposal, the representative of American First vehemently opposed it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We cannot accept this proposal!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, tauntingly, the People’s Association representative rebuked.
 </p>
 <p>
  Is that so? I will convey it to the Daegi Guild as well. If American First strongly opposes it, this proposal will not be passed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Ha. Are you threatening us right now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No? Threatening you? Who on Earth could threaten American First? We are simply conveying the facts about what happened today to the other side without any deductions.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “When did the representative of the People’s Association become a spokesperson for another guild?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A spokesperson…! You’re using harsh words!”
 </p>
 <p>
  And thus, the representatives of the two major guilds, the US and China, began a verbal dispute. In the end, the second agenda of the day did not pass, but the first agenda, to award the Guild of the Year to the Daegi Guild, was unanimously approved.
 </p>
 <p>
  This fact was immediately highlighted in the media.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Daegi guild, the first Guild of the Year from South Korea!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The unexpected choice by the People’s Association! The motivation included significant movements by the TOP 200 players.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The situation surrounding the Daegi Guild, the roles of the United States and China reversed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Headlines in South Korea about the Daegi guild made waves.
 </p>
 <p>
  The incident was even more shocking to people as the People’s Association, who opposed Seong Jihan before, now seemed to play an active spokesperson’s role.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow… China defending the Daegi guild?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -There really is a first time for everything, haha.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -When Seong Jihan broadcasted demanding the Guild of the Year, didn’t they say they wouldn’t accept it?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Yeah, never thought they’d really hand it over haha.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even for Koreans, Seong Jihan’s broadcast seemed like an excessive demand, so people naturally assumed it would be diplomatically declined. But the situation turned out differently.
 </p>
 <p>
  -What changed their stance so drastically?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Rumor has it that some Chinese players were planning to leave the People’s Association to create their own guild. Negotiating with the Daegi Guild…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Huh… Does that work in China?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -It’s just a rumor, but considering how rapidly the Chinese players fell in the rankings in the past two months, it seems possible.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -You guys should definitely watch the meeting later. The representatives of the US and China will probably exchange blows and rap up a storm.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow. Really… It was shocking today.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah looked at her phone on the sofa, still expressing disbelief.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The People’s Association siding with our guild, who would’ve thought.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If they are excluded from nurturing at this time, they’ll be at a loss.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, but… I couldn’t even imagine that it would turn out like that from their side.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The internal data must have been unusual.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As compared to foreign players belonging to the Daegi guild, Chinese players were noticeably lagging in growth.
 </p>
 <p>
  For them, too proud to even consider being a corpse without dignity, the agitation among the TOP 200 players was not something they could overlook.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since BattleNet’s entry into the main game, the importance of players had always been crucial, but as time went on, their significance only soared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if it meant twisting their pride, internal unfolding was likely considered paramount.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But to charge at American First like that right off the bat. 20 spots should suffice.’

 <p>
  The People’s Association that had lobbied for the Daegi guild beyond expectations at the World BattleNet Association deserved some recognition.
 </p>
 <p>
  So Seong Jihan decided to allocate a fair share of the slots to them.
 </p>
 <p>
  He looked kindly at Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s your level now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Me? 220. Lately leveling up has been tough.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah furrowed her brows.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Indeed, the skill levels of people have changed since Diamond mid-tier. They got stronger. And when matched with space races, most of the time, they lose… Why are the extraterrestrial races so strong?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Still, such struggle has actually made you grow quite a bit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Probably because of our guild effect and robust growth trait… Even if I lose, just one win gets me back on my feet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Players around Yoon Seah’s level often ended up losing out or barely maintaining their level even with a 1:1 win-loss ratio.
 </p>
 <p>
  But with both guild effects and the robust growth trait, she was displaying a remarkable growth effect even with low win rates.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, now that she had slowed down a bit after initially skyrocketing, she felt frustrated.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Inventory.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan opened his inventory and handed over the bow he had bought from Artemus.
 </p>
 <p>
  A longbow swirling with a pure white light, clearly extraordinary at first glance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah’s eyes sparkled at the sight.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, this bow… What is this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it from Artemus’s forge. It’s SS grade for now, but it evolves with the owner. Try using it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, uncle…!! A bow that grows with the owner!!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Trembling, Yoon Seah received the radiant longbow Seong Jihan handed to her.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow… The option to grow together is so good!! Except for the name [Artemus’s Bow], everything is to my liking!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. Use it well and level up quickly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah! But… Is this really expensive? How much is it, by the way? I’ll pay you back if I succeed!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s 20 billion GP.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……Huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah blinked.
 </p>
 <p>
  20 billion… GP?
 </p>
 <p>
  “U-uncle. Wait a minute. Why is a bow 20 billion GP…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why? It can reach SSS-grade or even higher.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, even if that’s the case… R-refund it right away! It’s an absurd price!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have a lot of money. Just use it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, still…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Yoon Seah panicked and tried to hand the bow back to Seong Jihan,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Boss! The World BattleNet Association contacted us!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Ding-dong! Ding-dong!
 </p>
 <p>
  The doorbell rang from the wall pad, and the face of Lee Hayeon appeaSeongred.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Daegi guild has been selected as the Guild of the Year, and they are asking you to grace the event in New York…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “To New York? When am I supposed to go that far? They can come here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ah, but… they say they’ve already dispatched a private jet for you…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing Lee Hayeon’s troubled expression, Seong Jihan let out a slight sigh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rejecting their request so bluntly was perhaps too discourteous for the Association.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright. I’ll go and come back quickly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan accepted the trip to New York with the thought of quickly returning after receiving the Guild of the Year award.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  A woman’s eyes sparkled as she read the news that Seong Jihan would be attending the Guild of the Year ceremony.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan… Is he finally coming out from there?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike Longinus and Dongbang sak, who wanted to educate Seong Jihan, her main goal was prophecy.
 </p>
 <p>
  And for her, prophecy could be performed without necessarily clashing on BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This opportunity shouldn’t be missed. I must go and see.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Educating him on BattleNet could come later; for now, she needed to focus on her prophecy.
 </p>
 <p>
  With these thoughts, Pythia smiled gently.

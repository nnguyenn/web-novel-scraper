  Chapter 226
 </p>
 <p>
  “That was truly amazing just now!”
 </p>
 <p>
  After the Guild of the Year ceremony concluded, Association President Jeff was at a dinner with Seong Jihan, exuberantly praising him and spitting out in excitement.
 </p>
 <p>
  “To sign like that for the audience in the Hall of Glory…! I’ve met numerous players, but no one could control their power so precisely like you!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jeff, who always attended the Guild of the Year awards to hand out prizes, had met more top-tier players around the world than anyone else. However, no one had shown him power like Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Anyone could cause harm to all of the audience in the hall, but…’
 </p>
 <p>
  In the case of the world’s top-ranked mage, for example, using a grand spell could set the entire hall ablaze if possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  But leaving a precise signature on each person’s left arm was a different tale entirely.
 </p>
 <p>
  It meant that control of power had reached a realm of maturity far beyond what top-tier players were capable of.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s nothing special.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Haha, you even humble yourself. Coach Davis, what did you think of the performance just now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Davis, the Earth’s team coach who was present at the banquet, enthusiastically gave a thumbs up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It was amazing. Seong Jihan is truly exceptional!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Because Seong Jihan had, thanks to his actions, turned the tide in the opening game against the Elves, the coach was naturally favorable towards him. And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mr. Seong Jihan, did you know about the next Space League match scheduled for a week from now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A week from now, already.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Today, he had to make an uncomfortable request to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s a favor related to that match I’d like to ask…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A favor?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes… Mr. Seong Jihan. You’re aware you’re currently ranked 11th in the world?”
 </p>
 <p>
  World player rankings.
 </p>
 <p>
  Levels were the foremost metric for these rankings, along with other combined metrics, the final score determined one’s place.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s prowess was now uncontestably recognized as humanity’s strongest by people worldwide. However, up until now, due to his lower level, he hadn’t been placed in a befitting rank.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But already the 11th?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Though the experience earned by Hidden Boss Seong Jihan was considerable, it was still a shockingly high placement considering all TOP 200 players had surpassed level 250.
 </p>
 <p>
  “11th place… I haven’t checked the world rankings specifically, so I didn’t know, but it’s higher than I expected, especially since I’m not yet level 250.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Level is the most important evaluation criterion, but everyone believes it’s underestimating you considering the achievements you have accumulated. 11th is considered very low by everyone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Davis slightly hesitated to continue.
 </p>
 <p>
  “However… from a coach’s standpoint, this 11th place… it’s absolutely crucial.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is it because of the ban card?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. It’s expected that the opponent’s race will use the ban cards that apply to the top 1-10 most extensively.”
 </p>
 <p>
  During the last match, the Elves refrained from using them for malicious intent. Normally, 1-10 ban cards were the most useful.
 </p>
 <p>
  When the opposing race was to draw a card, whether Seong Jihan was affected was crucial for the position of the Earth’s team coach.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…So could you remain in the 11th spot only until next week? I kindly ask that you refrain from playing games for just this week!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Davis, who never bowed to players while in American First, understood the importance of the Space League being much greater than any national competition.
 </p>
 <p>
  He earnestly pleaded, bowing to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This match is… against the Orcs, right?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Orcs, whom Seong Jihan had encountered during his promotion to diamond, disappeared from the rankings after revealing their true strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though the race was currently at the bottom at 20th place, they weren’t entirely weak.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Before the execution by the Elves, the core Orc players were quite strong.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Orc warriors dominated the then-strongest human warriors, leading to victory.
 </p>
 <p>
  After humanity faced two consecutive defeats and confirmed their bottom standing amidst increasing dungeons,
 </p>
 <p>
  the Orcs expected to reach the mid-tiers with a win and a loss.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, after consecutive losses facing the World Tree Elves, and the Orc warriors being executed, they stayed in lower ranks just like humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Regardless of competing in relegation, the current Orcs are not to be taken lightly.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan assessed and lightly nodded to the coach’s request.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay. I’ll try to slow down the leveling as much as I can.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you so much…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But I can’t stop Hidden Boss Seong Jihan from earning experience.”

 <p>
  “I’ll send out a global notice to all diamond players to refrain from raiding Seong Jihan for a week. Also, could you take players ranked 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th into the Daegi guild just for a while?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’ll work.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan agreed, brightening Davis’s mood.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It must’ve been a tough choice, but thank you for listening to my request…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s extraordinary to see a player competing for the top voluntarily halt their own leveling up, all for humanity… truly, Seong Jihan is a role model for all BattleNet players. On behalf of the association, we will award a special prize after the game.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jeff, like he was waiting for the opportunity, began to talk about a reward from the side.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah. Well, why not take a good rest during this week instead? The U.S. is full of places to see. Enjoy some sightseeing and then continue on to the Space League, later to receive a special award in the Hall of Glory.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  Famous tourist spots in the U.S.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had already visited all the places worth visiting in his past life.
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s no need to waste time.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, I must prepare for the match. Please bring any rewards to me in Korea from now on.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah. But, coming to Korea… that is…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Time spent idly in the sky is too much. If it’s challenging for you to come, you don’t have to.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A player who suggests the president of the BattleNet Association come deliver the award himself. Jeff, who once had an impulsive character, didn’t change his pleasant smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not at all. Of course, I must come. The opportunity to present an award to Seong Jihan is an honor!”
 </p>
 <p>
  After seeing Seong Jihan’s omnipotent signature move in the Hall of Glory,
 </p>
 <p>
  Jeff had no thoughts of pulling rank over him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, shall I arrange the private jet again for tomorrow?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s just go after the meal, then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s words, Jeff nodded and reached for his phone. But,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Um… Mr. Seong Jihan. Could we not return home today? It’s not so long ago we crossed the Pacific… could we rest for just a day?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon, who had joined for the meal, pleaded in surprise.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We will leave tomorrow.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He postponed the return by a day.
 </p>
 <p>
  Given Lee Hayeon was an ordinary person, the schedule had been tough.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay. Then I will make arrangements for the private jet for tomorrow.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, Jeff took personal charge, rearranging the schedule.
 </p>
 <p>
  After the banquet ended, Seong Jihan’s party spent the next day at the top hotel provided by the Association.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s been a while since I’ve been here.’
 </p>
 <p>
  New York, which was almost his second home for Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  The room provided by the Association was where he used to stay during his days as American First’s warrior.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking around the lavish room, he reminisced for a moment, when suddenly,
 </p>
 <p>
  Knock! Knock!
 </p>
 <p>
  There was an unexpected knock at the door.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll come in. Mr. Seong Jihan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A woman’s voice announced her entrance without asking permission. The door turned transparent as she strode in.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan turned his head towards her, raising his eyebrows.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You are… the one who avoided the signature earlier.”Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om
 </p>
 <p>
  He had dominated the entire Hall of Glory with his shadow realm.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though he had signed for everyone, the one person sitting in the front row vanished just as he attempted to sign on her shoulder.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘An unusual existence. It seems she came right away.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Hearing Seong Jihan’s words, the woman smiled as if delighted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehe. That’s right. You have a good sense. A usable one… You seem fit to become the nemesis of the Martial god…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Nemesis of Martial god?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Hearing the term “Martial god,” Seong Jihan gazed at the woman with deep eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you also one of the people of Martial god?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. The fourth disciple of the Martial god… the prophet, Nostradamus.”
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Nostradamus?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. I’ve operated under various names throughout human history, but my last alias was Nostradamus. If my name is too long, you can call me Pythia.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The woman smiled playfully, exploring around the room as if it were her own.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nice room~ Can I lie down on the bed?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Before waiting for permission, Pythia jumped onto the bed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow, it’s so soft!”
 </p>

 <p>
  Chuckling at her antics, Seong Jihan felt a bit more at ease.
 </p>
 <p>
  What’s her deal?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Disciple of the Martial god, Just say what you need to say and get up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can’t I just talk lying down? It’s your fault that I woke up from a good sleep.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Could you explain in a way that I can understand?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah. Was that too out of context? After you freed the Witch of the Void, I saw a prophecy that I had to become the new Witch of the Void to oversee the apocalypse. So, I woke up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Witch of the Void? My sister and you are related?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan stared at her in surprise at the mention of the Witch of the Void,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hm…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia sat up in bed, pointing her finger at him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now… let the prophecy begin!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Her eyes kept blinking as if they were camera flashes.
 </p>
 <p>
  For a moment, she gazed at Seong Jihan, then she hammered the bed with her fist.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… why doesn’t it work? Is it because of the Marital God’s restrictions?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Marital God’s restrictions? So you’re in the same case as Longinus?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. I couldn’t come in my original form. Oh, Was there a case like this only with our master… Could your Void be the reason? Or perhaps, are you something like a kin of the martial god?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The prophetess inquired if the prediction failing was due to him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan furrowed his brow at this fourth-dimensional behavior.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why do you ask me if the prophecy did not pass? Besides, tell me more about the Witch of the Void.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “About that? It’s no big deal. If the Witch of the Void is your sister, it’s a bad ending, but… do you want me to tell you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…A bad ending?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. You struggled with a monster to save her, utilized the power of the void too much, and nearly got sucked in. The Witch of the Void finally frees herself only to sacrifice herself for you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Calmly sharing the details of her prophecy, Pythia frowned at the part where the Witch of the Void disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So! They dragged me to oversee the apocalypse! Why would I even do something like that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Me sucked into the void…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s hard to believe a word of a martial god’s kin, right? You don’t have to believe it. Prophecies aren’t always right, after all.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She flashed a significant smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But non-believers always end up fulfilling the prophecy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “….”
 </p>
 <p>
  The fourth disciple of the Martial god suddenly burst in, dropping metaphorical bombs.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, maybe this way the prophecy will come true?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash! Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  Drawing a square with her fingers, Pythia attempted her lights again.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah. Doesn’t work! Then let’s do this!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Now painting a triangle in the air, Seong Jihan thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘She may seem out of her mind… but what she said just now is too disturbing to dismiss as madness.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The martial god, the Witch of the Void, the kin of martial god…
 </p>
 <p>
  These were things that only someone from the wandering martial god’s side would know, and she spoke of them too easily.
 </p>
 <p>
  To tell her to stop spouting nonsense and leave would mean foregoing that information.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But if I keep letting her lead, she’ll have the upper hand.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan wondered how not to be swayed by this whimsical woman, remembering that she introduced herself as the ‘Fourth Disciple’.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The first and second martial arts techniques associated with the Annihilation God’s Secrets were connected to Longinus and Dongbang Sak.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Could the fourth martial art also be related to her?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Even though I wasn’t powerful enough to use it before… this may be my chance.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan hadn’t been able to use the fourth of the Annihilation God’s Secret during his time as a martial god in his previous life, but could infer its attribute name.
 </p>
 <p>
  The attribute of the fourth technique was water.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan asked her.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Being a prophet is your ability, but why is your power associated with water?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Click, click! …What? Water?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia, who had been making clicking noises suddenly stunned,
 </p>
 <p>
  “…No? I’m all about fire. I should be bringing great disasters…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Her pupils twitched at Seong Jihan’s comment.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike before, a blue light seeped from her eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh… but it seems right… doesn’t it?”
 </p>

  Chapter 227
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia’s eyes turned blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  From her body, a cold chill began to emanate.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…It’s really true.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The response that appeared right after hearing Seong Jihan’s single question about why her powers were related to water.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia, looking at her own body, contorted her face in confusion.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You… How did you know that? I didn’t even know about it myself.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I wonder.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I thought it was strange when you used the powers of Longinus and Dongbang Sak, but this is completely unexpected. Their powers matched their karma exactly, but the power you revealed to me is different from my karma.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Karma… what exactly is your karma?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Prophecy. [In the Year 1999, the seventh month, from the sky will come a great King of Terror]… that kind of thing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Hearing one of Nostradamus’s most famous prophecies, Seong Jihan sneered slightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, you said you were Nostradamus, right? Why didn’t the world end in 1999?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “End? That prophecy wasn’t about the end. The right to see the final prophecy was taken by the Martial God.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “And?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s a BattleNet story. There is a 10-year margin of error… I mean, that can happen, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia winked slyly, leaving Seong Jihan frowning.
 </p>
 <p>
  BattleNet as the great King of Terror?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, the end would make sense.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In his previous life, humanity had indeed perished because of BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Pythia claimed she didn’t predict the end herself,
 </p>
 <p>
  it was true that BattleNet performed the role of the King of Terror.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Tell me. How did you know about my power that even I am unaware of? And what exactly is that power?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why would I tell someone like the Disciple of the Martial God?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course, I don’t expect you to tell me for free. I’ll provide you some information, too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Information?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Shall I tell you the names of the two disciples who are currently sleeping? They are people you’ll be quite shocked to hear about.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Longinus, Dongbang Sak, and now Nostradamus, who was standing before him—the Martial God disciples always had rather notorious names.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Seong Jihan wasn’t particularly interested in the other two.
 </p>
 <p>
  To him, it was not about the disciples but about the master.
 </p>
 <p>
  His greatest focus was on the ‘Wandering Martial God’ with whom he would eventually have to battle over the Martial Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, that’s okay. Instead, if you tell me about the identity of the Martial God, I’d consider it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The identity of the Martial God…? I’m curious myself too. You, like the Martial God, seem immune to my prophecies.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Prophecies don’t work on me and the Martial God?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. It’s completely dark. Perhaps because of the Void? I could only glean a little from your sister’s future… but with the Martial God, I can’t see any related details to consider at all.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then you… aren’t much use, are you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan spoke, Pythia puffed out her cheeks.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s too harsh! Really! Can’t you fulfill a delicate girl’s little wish?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Granny, stop pretending to be a girl.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What, what? Granny?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “When were you ever a contemporary person? You are hierarchically higher than a great-granny, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow… I’m speechless. Can’t believe I’m being called granny.'”
 </p>
 <p>
  Though her face turned red and she fanned herself, Pythia could offer no retort to Seong Jihan’s factual assault.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright. This ancient granny will do you a favor. Will you tell me then?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ancient granny?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Wandering Martial God took me during my time as a priestess in the Temple of Delphi, so yeah, it’s been a while. As you said, I am a granny among grannies, well over 2000 years old.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You have lived quite a long time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, will you be generous enough to fulfill an old woman’s request?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m not the kind to give in just because someone is older. It’s strictly give and take with me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Ahh, really. Prophecy doesn’t work on you, so I have nothing to give.. Just ask and I can answer.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Frustrated, Pythia thumped her chest.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then leave if you have nothing to offer.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, please! Just tell me. I’m dying to know about my hidden powers! My abilities related to the water element! I always thought they were about fire!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan dismissed her, Pythia threw a fit on the bed.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was unconsciously irritating to watch a woman of her age behave like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘She’s really curious about her abilities.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to use her curiosity to extract information from her.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s the Martial God doing now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He’s on his star. Haven’t you been there once?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, when I awakened the Martial Soul.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “From there, I acted as his guide, and he’s flying to the Thunder God Constellation now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Flying to the Thunder God. This must have been when Brahma was being suppressed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded, continuing his questioning.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why did you become one of the Martial God’s disciples?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “When Apollo tried to take my prophetic ability and blinded me, the Martial God appeared and saved me. In return, he took the ability to see humanity’s end.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Apollo? The sun god, Apollo?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”

 <p>
  “What does the Martial God look like?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t know. I can’t see his face. But… his body is much bigger than yours.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What about the Martial God’s martial arts?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A single swing of his hand can split the world.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Any weaknesses?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A weakness? He’s a god who can shatter planets single-handedly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan asked various other questions, but no particularly useful information came out.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It seems the Martial God is just incredibly powerful.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God showcasing his powers across his constellations, hunting constellations—at this point, he’s even advancing to subdue the mighty Brahma.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright. Are you done with your questions? Can you tell me now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No. It’s not informative enough.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ahh! You said it was give and take, right? How are we supposed to go forward if you only take?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You need to give something of decent value.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Having boldly offered information, perhaps she knew too little.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan pondered what he could ask her that would be worthwhile.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Ah, perhaps.’
 </p>
 <p>
  An idea struck him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you… by any chance, know the name of the Martial God’s martial arts?”
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Nameless Divine Arts.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the skill grade reaching SS, a peculiar condition had been added.
 </p>
 <p>
  Either remodel the three techniques to fit oneself, or reveal the true name of Nameless Divine Arts to awaken the skill completely.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ve been wrong about the crimson thunder.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He ambitiously pursued crimson thunder, thinking it might be connected to him and failed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, he had only one chance left.
 </p>
 <p>
  So far, without any hints, he dared not attempt this last chance.
 </p>
 <p>
  But this time was different.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Martial God’s… arts name?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. If you tell me that, I’ll tell you about your power.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A name? Not sure if there’s a distinct one… Whenever he swings his hand, the world splits apart. Oh, but, considering the Martial Gods’ disciple’s use of powers, there does appear to be a system…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia fell deep into thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  “XX Divine Arts. What do you think fits in XX?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Divine art…Nameless Divine Art lacks one letter, and…Bangmu Nameless Divine Art?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s Bangmu?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A short form for the ‘Wandering Martial God.'”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That doesn’t seem like the right answer.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I think so too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She quickly agreed and blinked her eyes, like when she tried to prophesize about Seong Jihan earlier.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ziiing…
 </p>
 <p>
  A hologram formed before her, and a man’s face appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  With brown curly hair and a long beard, the man carried a weary complexion on his weathered skin.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who is this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Martial God’s fifth disciple. He’ll be fighting the Martial God in the future, so I tried to get a clue.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash! Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  As she prophesized the man, Pythia addressed Seong Jihan,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you not curious about this man’s identity? How about we trade for this man’s name instead of an uncertain martial arts name?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s okay. I’m more curious about the name of the martial arts than some Middle Eastern guys.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow. How did you know he was from the Middle East?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking at his complexion and demeanor and having said so, it turned out it was true.
 </p>
 <p>
  Who could it be?
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan pondered,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hm. Hm… Of course, he’s the one who will oppose the Martial God in the future.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia nodded to herself upon seeing something, then capturing her bright gaze.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This might be a hint. [Martial God… indeed, you are invincible. The complete set of humanity’s information, the Fundamental Divine Arts… Even if I am ultimately human, I cannot surpass it.].”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ho.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In the future Pythia saw, there was a battle between the fifth disciple and the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  And it seemed he had left those words as a legacy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan focused on the term ‘Fundamental Divine Arts.’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Fundamental Divine Arts…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The two characters that fit into XX.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like he had found the answer.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, what could the two characters be? Fundamental origin martial arts? Human martial arts? First martial arts?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Be quiet. Let me guess the correct answer.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Was there even a correct answer?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. If it’s correct, I’ll tell you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan hushed the babbling Pythia then opened the skill window and clicked on Nameless Divine Arts.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Would you like to guess the true name of Nameless Divine Arts?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The true name is composed of two characters.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You are given your last chance.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Fundamental Divine Arts.”
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have revealed the true name of Nameless Divine Arts.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Nameless Divine Arts will now be elevated to an SSS+ grade as ‘Fundamental Divine Arts’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh… really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The system declared it as the correct answer.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan immediately turned to read the new skill description.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Fundamental Divine Arts]
 </p>
 <p>
  Skill Grade: SSS+
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  – The ancient martial power of the Martial God since creation.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  – Its true name has been discovered, unleashing its original capabilities.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  – With the constraints of Nameless Divine Arts entirely lifted, all of humanity’s martial arts ultimately converge on Fundamental Martial Arts, leading to innate acquisition of all human martial practices.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  – However, its origin lies with the Wandering Martial God, and thus, the skill is graded below EX to reflect this.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  – If one acquires all of the Annihilation God’s Secret Techniques and awakens their ultimate form, they can discover a new name for the martial arts, elevating it to EX grade.
 </p>
 <p>
  All martial arts of humanity converging into one…
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was astounded by the unprecedented capabilities of Fundamental Divine Arts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just by deducing the right two characters, can it be this good?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Of course, the Martial God stands at EX grade, while I am one step lower…’ but the fact that it culminates all of humanity’s martial arts and imparts wisdom was an immense power.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I might be able to use the third Technique of the Annihilation Series with just a little more growth.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Until now, he had not dared to attempt the third Technique of the Annihilation Series, but it was now within reach.
 </p>
 <p>
  And on top of that…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The fourth Technique of the Annihilation Series, related to the water element, now seems possible.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps because he had met its true owner, Pythia, for the fourth Technique.
 </p>
 <p>
  It appeared more accessible than the third.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The owner of Fundamental Divine Arts, the ‘Wandering Martial God,’ is watching you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A new system message popped up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh… Sir, about this…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [No further chatter is permitted. Return.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A stern voice echoed from the star—an indistinct language, yet perfectly understood by Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, generous! Thank you so much!”
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like Pythia was also conservative, saluting before hurriedly leaving the room.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have awakened faster than expected. But if you become complacent now… you will ultimately become part of me.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Part of him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Like in Seong Jihan’s dream, where he was absorbed by the Martial God—was there a connection?
 </p>
 <p>
  He twisted his lip into a sneer, replying to the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  “As if I’d be satisfied with just this. You still have to overcome me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Good attitude. Then for now, I permit you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  With the Wandering Martial God’s approval,
 </p>
 <p>
  [With the consent of the Wandering Martial God, the skill ‘Fundamental Divine Arts’ fully settles with the player.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was granted full access to Fundamental Divine Arts.
 </p>
 <p>
  An epitome skill for humanity, now made his own.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, his expression was anything but happy.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Fundamental Divine Arts’ SSS+ grade is outstanding but… this skill is ultimately just an inferior version of the Martial God’s power. And its existence hinges on his will.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was like being the Martial God’s livestock, fattened up and waiting to be devoured.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That can’t be my future.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan sharpened his eyes, gazing at the details of Fundamental Divine Arts,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Um… about that promise earlier.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia, who seemed to have left, was peering out from behind the door.
 </p>
 <p>
  The fourth Technique of the Annihilation Series.
 </p>
 <p>
  After all, he hadn’t shown it to her.
 </p>
 <p>
  Promises are promises, so Seong Jihan decided to uphold it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The fourth technique of the Annihilation Series. Ice Sword Rain of the Frozen Heavens.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Icy sky and… rain of swords… Hmm, I’ve only used swords just for maintenance… What kind of method is it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Just hearing its name, Pythia was puzzled, not quite picturing the fourth Technique Ice Sword Rain.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…I’m not sure why the Martial God misled her about her powers. There must be a reason.’
 </p>
 <p>
  She always thought her powers were related to fire, used to bring great disasters.
 </p>
 <p>
  Surely, the Martial God must’ve implanted that notion.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s still unclear why she was led to mistake water for fire.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was determined to interrupt the Martial God’s intentions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll show you Ice Sword Rain in the next Space League match.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really? Thank you!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Excited by Seong Jihan’s words, Pythia happily vanished from the room.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for waiting!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The day has finally, finally arrived…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Space League, the second match begins!]
 </p>
 <p>
  That day soon arrived.

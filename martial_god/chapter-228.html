  Chapter 228
 </p>
 <p>
  March brought the second Space League match of the year.
 </p>
 <p>
  This match, like the opening game, captured the attention of the whole world.
 </p>
 <p>
  And for good reason:
 </p>
 <p>
  =Is there ever an unimportant game in the Space League?
 </p>
 <p>
  =But today’s match is particularly crucial.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Since the human race has become the last place among the victorious races.
 </p>
 <p>
  =And now there isn’t much of a score difference between us and the 71st ranked World Tree Elf either.
 </p>
 <p>
  Humanity’s ranking situation was not exactly favorable.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Dungeons are starting to pop up frequently.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -From the North Korean territory where the Sword King had once purged completely, dungeon portals are resurfacing, right?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Yeah, and the GP prices are climbing too.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like the world was in better shape than during the tutorial times when we were co-leading the rankings.
 </p>
 <p>
  But as the points discrepancy between races widened and humanity dropped to 10th place, the situation began to decline more than during the tutorial times.
 </p>
 <p>
  For now, humanity could still manage the increasing dungeon portals with known strategies.
 </p>
 <p>
  But if rankings dropped further, the outcome was uncertain.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Thankfully, the opposing race is the bottom-ranked, the Orcs.
 </p>
 <p>
  =This is the race that player Seong Jihan encountered during the promotion match.
 </p>
 <p>
  =They may resemble pigs, but all of them have bodies like robust warriors.
 </p>
 <p>
  =During Seong Jihan’s promotion match, they were easily subdued, so it’s hard to gauge their full strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Isn’t every race that goes up against player Seong Jihan like that anyway? Haha!
 </p>
 <p>
  Fortunately, the opponents being the 20th-ranked Orcs meant the prognosis for the game was positive.
 </p>
 <p>
  -The Orcs truly seem like nothing special lol.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -No wonder they’re always near the bottom.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -They just got swept away during the promotion match.
 </p>
 <p>
  The opposing race, the Orcs.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the BattleNet, ruled by powerful alien races, they were seen as the most vulnerable opponents.
 </p>
 <p>
  Everyone anticipated victory in this second match.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is rather burdensome like the opening game.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps because of that, Coach Davis felt the pressure for this game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not knowing what hidden cards the opposing race might have, everyone assumed we would win.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a serious look, he inspected the players in the BattleNet waiting room before his eyes softened as they landed on Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Player Seong Jihan, you really kept your promise to be 11th rank. Thank you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Davis approached Seong Jihan and offered a handshake.
 </p>
 <p>
  As requested, Seong Jihan stopped at the 11th world player rank.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not vulnerable to any ban cards, able to play all positions, and demonstrating overwhelming power.
 </p>
 <p>
  For a coach, having such a player at his disposal was a blessing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “A promise is a promise.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Haha. At this rate, you might be playing every match. I count on you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then let’s end this in three sets and head back home.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Trustworthy as always.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon hearing Seong Jihan’s words, a pleased Coach Davis responded,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Both teams’ coaches, please report.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll head out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He was summoned to a separate space by the BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Davis, the coach who was conversing with Seong Jihan, was summoned.
 </p>
 <p>
  =The scene is changing.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Like the last time, the representatives were summoned to the office.
 </p>
 <p>
  =The Orc coach… translates to the ‘Great Chieftain.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly rising from the darkness was a pristine white table.
 </p>
 <p>
  Standing at the massive table’s two ends were the human coach, Davis, and…
 </p>
 <p>
  An Orc, easily 1.5 times larger than Davis – an enormous figure.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Grrr…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Orc, with his lower fangs protruding sharply, growled upon seeing Davis.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Humanity… the race with the hidden boss.”
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah, the hidden boss…
 </p>
 <p>
  =Is he referring to player Seong Jihan?
 </p>
 <p>
  =He’s famous even out of the Earth! The one-shot, one-kill hidden boss, Seong Jihan!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Speaking of which, apparently a memo went out to all guilds to maintain Seong Jihan’s rank at 11. To ignore him and not challenge the hidden boss.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Haha. A strategic move to prepare for the ban cards. Since only those up to 10th place will be affected!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Yeah. But when we interviewed players, it seems they were running scared even before the memo came out. No matter how appealing the rewards, they didn’t dare to challenge him anymore!
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  =Just one swing from him and you’ll split in half, what do you expect!
 </p>
 <p>
  Hidden boss Seong Jihan, notorious even beyond Earth, causing fear in dungeons across many worlds.
 </p>
 <p>
  Was he also making a name on the Orc planet?
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon encountering humanity, the Great Chieftain immediately mentioned Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then he looked at Coach Davis with sharp eyes,
 </p>
 <p>
  “You… you’re weak. Why would you represent your race?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Because I’m the coach of our national team.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Coach? Grrr… I don’t see how a coach without fighting ability is of any use.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Laughing mockingly right in Davis’s face, the Great Chieftain said.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Please place your ban and select cards on the table for the first match.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon the system’s prompt, He took out the cards he had prepared in advance.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Our select card is…
 </p>
 <p>
  =The Tower of Magicians!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Isn’t this map a solo matchmap for the mage class?
 </p>
 <p>
  =It turns into a team match map for Space League. 100 players will participate!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Tower of Magicians.
 </p>
 <p>
  This map featured two gigantic magic towers at a certain distance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mages would dwell there and unleash their firepower upon each other’s towers.
 </p>
 <p>
  =We have some interesting data on this map.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Yes, player Seong Jihan participated as a magician during that match!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Everyone thought China’s top magician Je Galheon would end the game, but they were counter-suppressed by Seong Jihan. It was the game that revealed the utmost utility of all Seong Jihan’s classes.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Is Davis picking this map today targeting Seong Jihan’s participation?
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as the commentators mentioned,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Orcs… it could be prejudice, but judging by the appearance of their race, their warriors seem mightier than their magic forces.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Coach Davis had his strategy for choosing The Tower of Magicians map.
 </p>
 <p>
  Humanity’s strongest point was the vanguard of warriors with Seong Jihan and the Sword King at the forefront.
 </p>
 <p>
  Based on ranking alone, there were more magicians in the TOP 10.
 </p>
 <p>
  Factoring out the irregularity of Seong Jihan, humanity’s magicians actually held more power.
 </p>
 <p>
  Conversely, the data for the Orcs was only from Seong Jihan’s promotion match.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘From that game, undead adversaries were bested by warriors and archers; there was barely a glimpse of magicians or supporters.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus,
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no need to directly face what seemed to be the more formidable Orcian warriors.
 </p>
 <p>
  Driving the game into a magician’s map, especially with the hidden card Seong Jihan in play, was the optimal strategy.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the other hand,
 </p>
 <p>
  =The Great Chieftain of the Orcs is taking out their select card. Thankfully, they are not doing any strange stuff like the Elves did.
 </p>
 <p>
  =The map’s name is Warrior’s Valley… This map is said to be a large battlefield where only warriors, 2000 of them in total, can participate!
 </p>
 <p>
  =2000? Can our representatives even meet those numbers?
 </p>
 <p>
  =It’s not just the team representatives, the races from 1st to 2000th ranking warriors are conscripted for the play.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Selecting a magicians’ map even with a hidden boss present… Does your race lack the pride of a warrior?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Great Chieftain, taking out his card, mocked Davis.
 </p>
 <p>
  Confident in the superiority of Seong Jihan, the warrior above warriors.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is way more comfortable than with the Elves.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Faced openly with a warrior card from the Orcs, Coach Davis answered with a smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why? Are your magicians weak?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Insects! Orc pride lies in strength, not in magic’s trickery!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really? Just take out the Tower of Magicians card, then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Impossible! We will face the hidden boss. I will prove that I am the supreme warrior, not him!”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a thud, thud, the Great Chieftain pounded his chest.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the table shook, Coach Davis inwardly broke into a cold sweat.
 </p>
 <p>
  Why, whether it’s the Elves or now…
 </p>
 <p>
  Why are all the representatives such formidable players?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Of course, I don’t think Seong Jihan will lose against that Great Chieftain, but to win for humanity, we need to thoroughly exploit their weaknesses.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Deciding not to select the warriors’ map, Davis took out the ban card.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Orcs’ 1 to 10 ranked players will receive a ban on 3 of them.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Players ranked 1, 7, 9 are banned and won’t participate in the first match.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Humanity’s’ 1 to 10 ranked players also receive a ban on 3 of them.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Players ranked 2, 3, 10 are banned and won’t participate in the first match.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Both species were subjected to reciprocal bans of three players each.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sword King Yoon Sejin, pondering the ban results, remarked,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I got banned. Maybe I should’ve pushed harder to go for 1st place.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The gap to Oliver closed quite a bit, you’ll probably overtake him next month, right Brother-in-law?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. I’ll get a taste of the freshest air up there before brother-in-law takes the first place.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems like you need to hurry there.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Seong Jihan, your 1st place ranking now seems inevitable.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Listening to their conversation, Lee Hayeon couldn’t help but look at Seong Jihan with a sense of disbelief.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Naturally.”
 </p>
 <p>
  For Seong Jihan, 1st place was an expected progression.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘In the current situation without national bonuses, there is no chance of my ranking dropping.’
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Previously, being a latecomer and national bonuses playing a significant role, the rankings dipped.
 </p>
 <p>
  But now, in the absence of such, level became the prime factor for ranking.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite not providing as much experience as when first introduced as the hidden boss, even so, his level was closing in on 249.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But about the Orcs. Are they truly only strong in the warrior class? What if they are hiding their strength like the Elves did…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What about it, Brother-in-law? Have you had any premonitions?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A premonition? No, I didn’t have any.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan observed the Orc Great Chieftain intensely on the screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  This chief was the most powerful Orc warrior before being executed by the Elves, the player who defeated the Sword King in the previous life’s second match.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘And if the Orc planet was chosen by BattleNet, there must be something…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite playing relegation with them later on,
 </p>
 <p>
  he couldn’t be complacent.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, pointing at the chieftain said,
 </p>
 <p>
  “That chieftain looks quite strong.”Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… I thought so too. We’ll need to be cautious if it’s the warriors’ map.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Could they be concealing their magical strength?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s unlikely.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In his previous life too, the Orcs’ weakness was their magicians and supporters.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were a race that laid everything in plain sight.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having made his certainty clear,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Phew…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I feel relieved now that Boss has said so.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Not only Lee Hayeon but also other players around sighed in relief upon hearing him.
 </p>
 <p>
  After many doubts with the Elves, they felt secure with Seong Jihan’s prophecy-revealing ability.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The map for the first match has been decided.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The first match will proceed in ‘The Tower of Magicians’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ooh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Tower of Magicians it is.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a favorable outcome!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The coach has good luck.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As per Coach Davis’s intentions, the first match map was settled.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the result, the Great Chieftain of the Orcs grimaced.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Humanity, even with a hidden boss, you lack spirit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s see how superior your magician forces really are.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmph…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  With Davis’s retort, the Great Chieftain snorted, but once the game started,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Grrr…”
 </p>
 <p>
  He turned his eyes away from the screen and closed them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because,
 </p>
 <p>
  =Uhh…
 </p>
 <p>
  =The Orcs’ magic is weaker than expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Their spells are hardly reaching our tower, see.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Oliver and Je Galheon are bombing the enemy’s magic tower in competition!
 </p>
 <p>
  The game was embarrassingly one-sided.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Their level of magicians is even more tragic this time.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In the Space League’s Tower of Magicians map, with towers piercing the sky, and despite the considerable distance,
 </p>
 <p>
  Humanity’s magicians could bomb from afar without hindrance, unlike Orc magicians who suffered.
 </p>
 <p>
  A battle like cannon against bow.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Player Seong Jihan… is flying towards the enemy’s magic tower but…
 </p>
 <p>
  =The game will end before he gets there.
 </p>
 <p>
  =The Orcs stand no chance against our firepower!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan prepared to use the Ice Sword Rain as promised, but
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…it’s finished already?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Before he could even use his martial technique, the game was over.
 </p>
 <p>
  =We won the first match easily!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Player Seong Jihan had to stop advancing midway.
 </p>
 <p>
  =The game ended before he could start!
 </p>
 <p>
  The game concluded with American Oliver as the MVP, and Davis smiled more relaxedly at the Great Chieftain.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Great magical forces, huh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Magic, a mere cowardly trick. Orcs revere only strength!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so? It will always be magicians’ maps only.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Orcs were much more transparent than the Elves.
 </p>
 <p>
  Coach Davis picked a magicians’ map for the second match as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  But this time, luck was not on his side.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The map for the second match has been decided.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The second match will proceed in ‘Warrior’s Valley’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Great Chieftain, upon seeing the result, flashed his vicious teeth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Bring out the hidden boss immediately. I will personally send you all to your deaths.”

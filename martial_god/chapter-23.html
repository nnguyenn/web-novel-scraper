 <h3>
  Chapter 23
 </h3>
 <p>
  [Translator – Zain]
 </p>

 </p>
 <p>
  [Welcome to the Bronze League – Gangnam Area]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The mission is Defense.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, after returning home, logged into the game while wearing a suit.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a zombie mission this time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The mission was to survive while blocking the zombies coming up the tower until only five teams remained.
 </p>
 <p>
  The achievement quest window still displayed the uncompleted chain quest from last time.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Chain Quest – Zombie’s Source (1)]
 </p>
 <p>
  * Eliminate 1,000 zombies alone.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Reward – Achievement Points 3,000]
 </p>
 <p>
  * Upon completion, the quest continues to Zombie’s Source (2).
 </p>
 <p>
  “At that time, it was impossible, but now I can easily clear it.” During the previous game, Seong Jihan had low levels and power, but now his abilities had greatly improved, and he had gained another unique stat boost.
 </p>
 <p>
  With this much strength, he could easily sweep away the zombies below the tower.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had also prepared items that were perfect for this map.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Inventory.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan opened his inventory and summoned the weapons within it.
 </p>
 <p>
  In his right hand, a large sword the size of a person appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Otherworldly Artifact – Urk’s Divine Executioner Sword (C-Rank)]
 </p>
 <p>
  – A sword used by Urk’s high priest to offer sacrifices at the altar of the gods.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Excellent for cleaving through monsters’ bodies.
 </p>
 <p>
  When his divine power reached 10.
 </p>
 <p>
  [From now on, you can only absorb Divine Power from relics that are C-rank or higher.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Receiving this message, he purchased the item for testing purposes.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I wonder if absorbing divine power from artifacts of the Otherworld will also increase my force.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A unique stat boost that combined divine power and mana.
 </p>
 <p>
  To see if absorbing divine power would increase his force, Seong Jihan boldly spent all his GP to purchase a C-Rank weapon.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s quite big.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite being C-Rank, the price was not as high as he expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  Urk’s Divine Executioner Sword was too large and heavy for humans to wield comfortably.
 </p>
 <p>
  A sword that many warrior classes had avoided for that reason.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish! Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s usable.”
 </p>
 <p>
  However, when such a weapon came into Seong Jihan’s hands, it spun as lightly as a wooden stick.
 </p>
 <p>
  The synergy between power and force made it even more powerful, enabling this.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now that I’m all prepared, I want to go down right away, but…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The defense map wouldn’t start until all the team members were summoned.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan turned on the Battle Tube broadcast while waiting for the rest of the team to join.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Oh? Seong Jihan has started the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  – You went straight into playing after visiting the auction house? In a suit, no less.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Kingsman
 </p>
 <p>
  – That’s just how that guy is. He used to play games in his sweatpants.
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as the broadcast began, viewers started pouring in.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps it hadn’t been long since the Sword King’s auction had ended. It hadn’t been that long since the broadcast had started, but more people were joining than expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since the game hadn’t started, the chat window was open and active.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked around, gauging the atmosphere.
 </p>
 <p>
  – A zombie map, huh?
 </p>
 <p>
  – The power He revealed at the auction… will he use it here too?
 </p>
 <p>
  – This is Scout Kim Jinhwan who greeted you a little while ago. The psychic power you showed earlier was really impressive. I regret that I couldn’t have a longer conversation with you earlier. Could you open your message box?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The atmosphere isn’t bad.’
 </p>
 <p>
  There were a lot of chat messages that seemed to be from scouts.
 </p>
 <p>
  In his previous life, the chat window might have been filled with Pro-Japanese comments during this time, but now the atmosphere was relatively pleasant.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Mr. Seong~ Good luck! It’s Take-chan , and I’m ready to send some more donations. ♡♥ Could you open your message box…?
 </p>
 <p>
  – An annoying brat.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Stop pretending to be cute, you f***er!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Korean people are harsh with the words. Hmph.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Take’s chat messages were annoying, since so many people were chatting, they quickly scrolled past.
 </p>
 <p>
  – How did you tear the business card earlier?
 </p>
 <p>
  – What kind of ability is that? Any guesses?
 </p>
 <p>
  – No idea.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Is it something like psychic power?
 </p>
 <p>
  Most viewers were curious about the ability Seong Jihan had demonstrated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though it was just a performance of tearing a business card, it was an out-of-spec power within the Battle Net class.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not only regular viewers but also the scouts were paying close attention to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I guess it’s time to make a bet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan checked the channel’s subscribers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Over 12,000.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps due to the exclusive coverage of the auction, there were more than 4,000 additional subscribers compared to before.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a result, one achievement quest had been cleared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The channel’s subscribers have exceeded 10,000.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Cleared the regular achievement, ‘Recruit Subscribers (1).’]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Reward: 1,000 Achievement Points.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘From now on, increasing subscribers won’t be easy.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Up until now, he had been at the center of events that attracted the world’s attention, so his subscribers had rapidly increased as a secondary effect.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, Seong Jihan’s potential was exceptional, so he could easily increase subscribers by moving to a higher league, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Instead of waiting idly for that, I should make the most of what I have here.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to take advantage of the current situation where aggro was drawn to him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hello, everyone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He greeted lightly while looking at the chat.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Oh, Jihan is reading the chat!
 </p>
 <p>
  – I think it’s because the game hasn’t started yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Hello!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Hi hi~~
 </p>
 <p>
  “As I’ve been looking through the chat, it seems that many of you are curious about my abilities.”
 </p>
 <p>
  – Reveal. Your. Status.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Reveal your status window.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Seong Sang~♡♥ It’s Take-chan again, If you share your status window, I might donate again…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Why is that guy so great at writing Korean in such a disgusting way?
 </p>
 <p>
  – I’ll also donate 10,000 GP!
 </p>
 <p>
  Many people said they would donate GP if Seong Jihan revealed his status window, but he just smiled and brushed it off.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead…
 </p>
 <p>
  “I won’t be revealing my status window… I’m sorry.”
 </p>

 <p>
  – Aw
 </p>
 <p>
  – Why not?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Just show it, show it, show it, show it, show it, show it, show it, show it, show it, show it
 </p>
 <p>
  –
 </p>
 <p>
  Amidst the fiery enthusiasm, Seong Jihan thought for a moment, then extended his index finger and spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Instead, I’ll make a deal. I’ll reveal it if I reach 200,000 subscribers.”
 </p>
 <p>
  – 200,000? Are you kidding?
 </p>
 <p>
  – So, you’re not going to do it.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Just do it, come on!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Seong Sang… ♡♥ I’ll donate 50,000 GP, just show me a little glimpse!!! ^O^
 </p>
 <p>
  The sentiment took a sharp turn as the idea of 200,000 subscribers was introduced.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan pondered for a moment again, then broke into a satisfied expression, as if saying, ‘This is good!’
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then I’ll make another condition. If I cannot finish 1st, I’ll reveal it. How about that?
 </p>
 <p>
  – ?
 </p>
 <p>
  – ????
 </p>
 <p>
  – ????????
 </p>
 <p>
  As viewers went into shock, Seong Jihan stated confidently,

   “I’ll definitely reveal it in that case. Agreed?”
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   The promise was that he would reveal his status window if he didn’t get 1st place in any future game.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   The chat started flooding with laughter.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   – Not just a winning streak, but 1st place in every game? Haha.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   – Hahaha.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   – Does he think finishing 1st is easy?
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   – He’s bluffing to attract attention. It seems like he’s become too arrogant after finishing 1st consecutively.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   Achieving 1st place in Battle Net was something that even the most exceptional players couldn’t casually guarantee. While winning the game itself often relied more on skill than luck, as long as you ended up in the top 50%, luck was less of a factor. However, 1st place required both skill and luck to align.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   – If he talks like that, he will end up meeting a troll and shedding bloody tears.

   “Hello~!!!! Nice to meet you all! I’m Streamer Golden Light. Today, I’ll be exploring the deep sea with all of you once again! The broadcast started a bit late today, right? I was checking out the auction house… Oh… Seong, Seong Jihan-nim!?”

   – The archer who shoots soccer balls instead of arrows!

 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   Diego Masid was an Archer who was considered the worst team player.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   Despite being a long-range dealer, he never dealt any damage and only threw soccer balls, making him a legendary troller.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   His playing pattern was simple. He throws soccer balls from his inventory of 10 slots, and once he uses up all 10 soccer balls, he stands still until he gets defeated.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   In a different Bronze League, people might consider this a comedic act, or it might pass as entertainment. But in the most serious and intense Gangnam Area, the situation is different.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   Teaming up with players like him in such a serious and competitive environment made the others want to tear their hair out.

  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   However…
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   Upon seeing Diego Masid’s name in the chat, Seong Jihan’s eyes widened.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   ‘Masid?’
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   Diego Masid, Argentina’s top player. He was a powerful player who had upheld the ranking of Argentina’s league all by himself. While he didn’t make it to the final ten countries and eventually fell in battle. Still, his unique playstyle garnered him high fame even after his fall.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   “But… he was a Mage class?”
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   Remembering the videos of Masid he had seen before, Seong Jihan smirked. His appearance was vastly different from the clean look in the videos. His face was untidy due to the long beard, and his body was lean and emaciated.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   As Seong Jihan silently gazed at Masid, Masid lifted his head and said in broken Korean, ” Don’t mind me.”
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   After stumbling through some Korean words, Masid kicked the ball again. It must be at this point that he earns the title of a true troll.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   ‘But… he doesn’t seem interested in communication.’
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>

   There was no need to waste time on a partner who clearly had no intention of conversing. There was no need to pour time into someone who seemed unwilling to engage in a conversation.

  Chapter 230
 </p>
 <p>
  Fundamental Divine Arts: Annihilation God’s Secret, Ice Heaven Sword Rain.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s Eclipse froze in his grip.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The sword left his hand and soared autonomously into the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you trying to do!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The chieftain charged at Seong Jihan, who was now without his weapon.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!!
 </p>
 <p>
  Before he could reach him, from the Phoenix Flag in Seong Jihan’s hand, a Crimson lightning burst forth, completely incinerating the chieftain’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  Demonstrating superior power than the basic moves of Triad of Martial Mastery, the lightning attack annihilated the chieftain’s form.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, a fiercer gray light burst from the sky and the obliterated chieftain soon reappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…You truly extinguished me completely.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He looked incredulously at Seong Jihan and then toward the heavens.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But as long as the ancestors’ blessing is with me, I will not die… Huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Just then,
 </p>
 <p>
  the supportive gray light from the sky quickly faded.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the same time,
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle… Crackle!
 </p>
 <p>
  Around the Eclipse in the sky, the heavens rapidly began to freeze over.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You fool… You think you can freeze the sky? Do you think that’s even possible?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The chieftain scoffed outwardly, but unlike before, he refrained from charging recklessly at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead, he observed the waning gray aura for a moment and began to retreat hastily.
 </p>
 <p>
  He made a cold judgment: without the ancestors’ blessing, he was no match.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How can it continue…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The sky was freezing faster than the chieftain could flee,
 </p>
 <p>
  Thunk! Thunk…!
 </p>
 <p>
  From the frigid heavens, massive entities began to descend one by one.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is this…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are those… swords?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Column-like shapes of ice and water, resembling swords, the Ice Heaven Sword Rain landed directly onto the gathered Orc warriors behind the chieftain.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How do we block this!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Throw your bodies! Protect the circle’s center!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Trying to maintain formation despite the overwhelming force disparity, the Orc battalion bravely hurled themselves against the giant ice swords.
 </p>
 <p>
  But before even touching the ground, their bodies were frozen solid.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the pillars of swords anchored into the earth, the Orc battalion was crushed, and the frozen heavens descended, shattering the firmament.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Gr, Grr…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The formation maintenance is impossible. Evade…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…The heavens are falling, where should we escape?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “And the ground’s frozen over. Can’t even lift my feet!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the ground was skewered by Ice Heaven Sword Rain, instantly froze over, and the firmament above descended squarely upon the Orc battalion,
 </p>
 <p>
  it was a disaster they simply couldn’t stand against.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thump…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The skies and the earth merged into ice.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Orcs, caught between, were obliterated without a trace.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I… How could a mere player do this…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the chieftain stood alone, having barely escaped the range, he shivered, looking back at the devastation
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  .
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  “How could a single player… accomplish this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, despite the chieftain’s horror,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, upon using Ice Heaven Sword Rain for the first time, seemed dissatisfied with the result.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is it because it’s my first time using it? It seems Ice Heaven Sword Rain targeted the wrong entity…’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was fine until freezing the sky and diminishing the Orcs’ ancestral power.
 </p>
 <p>
  But why Ice Heaven Sword Rain targeted Orcs behind the chieftain instead of him remained a mystery.
 </p>
 <p>
  Was it a lack of control over the fourth Annihilation Technique, a skill yet new to him?
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan contemplated Ice Heaven Sword Rain, a realization dawned.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Aha.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Noticing a distinct change in the aura around the retracted chieftain,
 </p>
 <p>
  “The power from your ancestors… has markedly diminished.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What nonsense are you spouting?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “With Ice Heaven gone, the gray energy should be resupplying you from the sky. But it’s not regenerating you, it’s waning, isn’t it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Looking back, the Orc warriors’ formations were strange.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Orc warriors had gathered in circles of a hundred each, spaced far apart.
 </p>
 <p>
  It mirrored the past life, raising questions about potential bonuses for the Orcs.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So the power came not from ancestors but from them, did it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Grr.”
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">

 <p>
  The chieftain’s power was undeniably formidable, even overpowering in its capacity to regenerate and grow stronger after injury.
 </p>
 <p>
  If this had not been ‘Seong Jihan,’ the hidden boss himself might have stood a chance given prolonged combat…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Dungeons maps couldn’t deploy a thousand warriors at once. So that level of regeneration was impossible. That’s why the hidden boss failed.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Ice Heaven Sword Rain then must have precisely struck the true source of power.
 </p>
 <p>
  Could the feature of Ice Heaven Sword Rain be to attack the source of power?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan reflected on the deployment of Ice Heaven Sword Rain that fused heaven and earth.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Drawing upon the source to strike… is that Ice Heaven Sword Rain’s characteristic?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Still not fully understanding the fourth Annihilation Technique despite having wielded it, Seong Jihan concluded further study was needed, then slowly approached the chieftain, standing still.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…You, what’s your name?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Defeated in spirit, the chieftain enquired with resignation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You needn’t know.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  With a casual slash, Seong Jihan beheaded him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  With a roll, the head and body separated, spilling blood across the soil, but considering he regenerated from total deletion before, this injury should not have been fatal.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet now,
 </p>
 <p>
  no gray light descended upon the chieftain’s head,
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I have lost.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Closing his eyes at that declaration.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The second match concludes.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Humanity has won the match.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Player Seong Jihan is named the match MVP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The game was over.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  =Uh…
 </p>
 <p>
  =The game is finished! Humanity is victorious!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Player Seong Jihan accomplishes a solo 1000 kills!! Stronger than ever!
 </p>
 <p>
  Match two…
 </p>
 <p>
  For humanity, the game began inauspiciously.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not only was it on the Orcs’ favored map, but the Sword King Yoon Sejin also faced a ban.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nonetheless,
 </p>
 <p>
  The outcome was entirely unexpected.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is Seong Jihan a god?? Is Seong Jihan a god?? Is Seong Jihan a god??
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Not even joking, but like seriously, he’s god at this point;
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -That’s why he just keeps getting stronger every game lol lol lol
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Wow, the second match ended even faster than the first o_o
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Ordered chicken, but the Space League is about to end before it has even arrived….
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan’s power was always a spectacle, no one could have predicted he’d solo defeat 1000 players in the opponent’s strongest arena.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why is he ranked 11th then? lol The ranking system is a mess –
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Good thing he’s 11th, he won’t face a ban lol
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -The enemies will probably just ban the 1st rank from now on, if it’s Seong Jihan they’re up against, so terrifying!
 </p>
 <p>
  With the dominating victory, the chatroom overflowed with a festive air.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike national confrontations, the Space League united humanity in this collective fate.
 </p>
 <p>
  People of every nationality savored the overwhelming triumph as if in another world.
 </p>
 <p>
  -What will the countries of the Northeast Asia League do now?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Just fall one rank down, lol
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Seong-nim (Seong Jihan) will ensure the Space League rank, so no worries about regional league demotion lol
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -The Sword King wouldn’t have stood a chance anyway lol. Already those from the same league as Korea assumed a step down as given.
 </p>
 <p>
  Coach Davis grinned ear-to-ear with the second easy victory,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘With him doing all the work, it’s certainly easy for a coach… I’m so grateful he’s on our side!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether against the elves or now,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan singularly carried the matches with crazy prowess.
 </p>
 <p>
  Coach Davis indulged freely in the antics as humanity’s team representative.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile,
 </p>
 <p>
  “…That player from earlier, what’s his name?”
 </p>
 <p>
  From across the table, the chieftain who had lost his head in the second match asked Davis with an aged expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  The chieftain’s fixation on the name had been persistent.
 </p>
 <p>
  Davis, with a sneer, replied,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Think I’d tell you? Just throw out your card, chieftain.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sigh… What’s the use anyway? There’s a crazed monster among you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  For the selection and ban of the third match, the chieftain carelessly threw out a random card.
 </p>
 <p>
  Such behavior as a representative was unthinkable, but the blow of his recent defeat led him to an almost game-throwing surrender.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Orcs’ 1 to 10 ranked players will receive a ban on 3 of them.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Players ranked 3, 4, 5 are banned and won’t participate in the third match.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Humanity’s’ 1 to 20 ranked players will receive a ban on 5 of them.]
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  [Players ranked 1, 6, 10, 11, 19 are banned and won’t participate in the third match.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps tossing it absentmindedly, he threw a card that, instead of the usual 1-10, banned 5 players from 1-20.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…A pit fight? Ahh, against that monster again… Huh? Rank 1 has been banned?”
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  brightening upon viewing the system message,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Forewent, yet rank 1…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The third match beamed to life.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This time it’s my turn.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If the chieftain comes out, wipe out the Orcs behind him first. They are the source.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay, brother-in-law.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Humanity’s players, with Yoon Sejin replacing the banned rank 11 Seong Jihan,
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Ohh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The chieftain, participating in the third fight, looked around at his foes with a radiant smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  That monster, Now that the 1st rank was banned, he’s gone!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now, things are different…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Charging fiercely toward humanity,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s start with the Orcs in the back!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Humanity, though lacking Seong Jihan, followed his hint, targeting the Orcs rather than the chieftain.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the all-position Arena map, the human mages poured firepower towards the circular Orc warriors,
 </p>
 <p>
  “What? They looked so weak before…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Surprisingly sturdy, aren’t they?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Orc warriors, a stark contrast from their last match’s display,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Grrrrrr!!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The chieftain, trampling the warriors blocking his way, rampaged through humanity’s backlines,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll shred you all!”
 </p>
 <p>
  He unleashed a brutal slaughter, vengeful for the second match’s disgrace.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ahh, no one can stop the chieftain!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Was he always this strong??
 </p>
 <p>
  =The Sword King trying to mark him but… the chieftain utterly ignoring the attacks, focusing solely on decimating the magic forces!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah, the Sword King, conceding it’s futile, changed direction. Now he’s aiming to break the Orcs’ formation!
 </p>
 <p>
  =But… before that, our side will be annihilated first! The chieftain, he’s insane!!
 </p>
 <p>
  The chieftain was formidable only when Seong Jihan was absent.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now banished, he seemed to fly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kukh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You are fairly strong. But…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin held his own, fighting fiercely against the chieftain,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I AM UNMATCHED!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  Eventually, he couldn’t counter the chieftain’s fist.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  =Match three… We lost.
 </p>
 <p>
  =How could the chieftain be so powerful?!!
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, the third Arena match went to the Orcs,
 </p>
 <p>
  seemingly reinvigorated, the chieftain sat triumphantly back in the representatives’ room.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Haha. You humans… without that hidden boss, you’re not much, now are you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The chieftain, with arms crossed, looked down on Coach Davis with arrogance.
 </p>
 <p>
  “One strong player… then the solution is simple.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssshh!
 </p>
 <p>
  He pulled out a ban card, placing it on the table.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Humanity’s’ player ranked 1st is banned. Will not participate in the fourth match.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now, I shall turn the tide.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The chieftain laughed confidently.
 </p>
 <p>
  And Coach Davis,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ck… damn it…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Struggled to hold back his twitching lips, trying desperately to keep a serious face.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Rank 1 banned lololololol
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Check out the coach’s acting skills lolololol
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Why do I feel bad for the chieftain having fun lololol
 </p>
 <p>
  “Warrior’s Valley! My luck is good today!”
 </p>
 <p>
  So began the fourth game on the same map, Warrior’s Valley.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hello?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s end this one even quicker.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan waved at the chieftain before sending his sword into the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What, what’s going on? You… Why are you here? You were banned!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. Good job.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The fourth match followed the same pattern as the second.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thunk!
 </p>
 <p>
  The chieftain’s head fell even as he wondered,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Didn’t I ban the 1st rank…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  And following the end of the match,
 </p>
 <p>
  […I enjoyed watching your game.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Disciple of the Martial God, Pythia, contacted him.

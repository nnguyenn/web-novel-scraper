  Chapter 232
 </p>
 <p>
  A week after the Space League games, the Korea-Japan match is underway.
 </p>
 <p>
  The outlook for this game had drastically changed compared to six months ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  -1.01… Is that the real odds??
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Betting on Korea’s win gives you a 1% profit, huh? lol
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -It was originally at 1.05, but after Seong Jihan became the Space League MVP, it dropped even more lol
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Makes sense, the Japanese players are betting on Korea’s victory too? There seems to be a lack of talent in Japan nowadays.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -It’s the total opposite of last year’s Independence Day lol
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether it was the Independence Day when the Sword King moved to Japan,
 </p>
 <p>
  Or the subsequent Korea-Japan match where Seong Jihan rose rapidly, fighting the Sword King.
 </p>
 <p>
  The 2021 Korea-Japan match was expected to end predictably, unlike previous years.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who dominated the Space League games,
 </p>
 <p>
  And now evaluated as warrior rank 2, but still the formidable Sword King, Yoon Sejin, would participate as well,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whereas Japan, after the Sword King returned to Korea, hasn’t seen the emergence of any SSS-ranked players,
 </p>
 <p>
  Continually struggling at the bottom of the Northeast Asia League rankings.
 </p>
 <p>
  Korea’s easy victory seemed predestined.
 </p>
 <p>
  Koreans showed more interest in other developments rather than the predictable game outcome.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Turns out Yoon Seah also joined the national team this time.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Eh? Yoon Seah? Isn’t that a bit… Did she use family connections?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -└└└ Last month, Yoon Seah’s win rate was top among the diamond archers, she was always good, but after changing her bow, she’s insane.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Wow…that family is full of monsters o_o
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -The speed of her growth is unbelievable lol!! Two games a day is such a cheat
 </p>
 <p>
  With the assertive growth trajectory, Yoon Seah shows off the true potential of the late bloomer’s gift. Her Void Arrows, since changing bows, fire in quick seven-arrow volleys, devastating battlefields.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But if the gift is only quick growth and eventually plateaus, wouldn’t it be nothing special?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Exactly. It may not be directly combat affecting or something beneficial
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -It’s good she’s in the national team, but whether she’ll shine is another question…
 </p>
 <p>
  However, compared to the monstrous performances of Seong Jihan or the Sword King,
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah received a colder reception from the public,
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet the Korean national team staff thought differently.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Turtle Formation is breached.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “All warriors are down.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The national team held practice games incorporating the newly joined Yoon Seah with the existing warriors.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her performance was astonishing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We knew Void Arrow was strong, but…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah’s unique Void Arrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  Arrows vanished and emerged back to strike, leaving even diamond-class warriors unable to properly block them.
 </p>
 <p>
  People thought lower-ranked players might stand a chance, but with her new bow, Yoon Seah was easily hunting down even national-level players.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We never expected her to easily penetrate the Turtle Formation like this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I know, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The defensive formation, the Turtle Formation, formed by national team players,
 </p>
 <p>
  It used to be effortlessly destroyed by outliers like Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Typically, breaking through required intense combat.
 </p>
 <p>
  But to pierce it with arrows…
 </p>
 <p>
  “If Yoon Seah keeps growing at this pace, we might even aim for the Champions League victory this year…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t count the chickens before they hatch. We can’t even guarantee making it to the main competition yet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Coach Noh Youngjun reprimanded the over-excited staff, but his eyes gleamed with anticipation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you want to lead this time, Seah?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Archer Division Leader Ha Yoori welcomed Yoon Seah coming out of the BattleNet connector.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Eh. Come on, with Unnie here, why would I lead!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re stronger than me. I can’t even break the Turtle Formation by myself.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Break it by myself? But I got help from Akari Unnie!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssss!
 </p>
 <p>
  Beside Yoon Seah, Akari shook her head upon hearing this.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Together…? I merely stood there. You handled it all.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You had no rear guard concerns, so you were free to pull your bow to its limit!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Indeed. I saw you smoothly deflect the warriors’ attack.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Um, is it really okay for me to join the national team? As an assassin, in the archery ranks… I’m not sure if I’m needed…”
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">

   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Akari, who joined the national team roster with Yoon seah, had grown to level 245, easily qualifying her, but as an Archer variant class, the Assassin wasn’t a perfect fit for Korea’s archer division.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry. Our archer division has more than enough firepower with the addition of Seah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. Games aren’t always about confronting enemies head-on. In places like dungeons, assassins shine.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… Uncle! Weren’t you practicing?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah was surprised to see Seong Jihan coming toward the BattleNet connector.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hadn’t he disappeared to practice again? When did he return?
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m stuck on something tricky, so I’ve wrapped up my practice for now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You, Seong Jihan, find things difficult?”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Ha Yoori’s playful comment, Seong Jihan shrugged.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m not a god to find everything easy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The fourth of the Annihilation technique, Ice Heaven Sword Rain.
 </p>
 <p>
  After Pythia mentioned this skills true intention lies in reconnaissance,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan spent time in the Void Training Room, repeatedly practicing it.
 </p>
 <p>
  But…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Reconnaissance doesn’t seem to click. Sword Rain seems related, though…’
 </p>
 <p>
  During the previous game, Sword Rain intercepted the source of the Great Chieftain’s power,
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite Seong Jihan not directly commanding it, the swords targeted the Orc warriors automatically.
 </p>
 <p>
  If reconnaissance is truly the intent of Ice Heaven Sword Rain, then it connects with that incident.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet in the Void Training Room, he could freeze the sky, but the swords didn’t form as vividly as before.
 </p>
 <p>
  Raining down, it was more a genuine downpour than an ice storm.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan pondered the Ice Heaven Sword Rain,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ha Yoori teased with a grin.
 </p>
 <p>
  “A god… after watching the previous game, I thought you were one. There’s even a ‘Church of Seong Jihan,’ you know?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan Church? What’s that about?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What else but a religion that believes in you? That you’ll be the messiah to save humanity?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Unnie, You’re joking, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No joke. Yuri’s convinced such cults should be suppressed before they grow, she’s been reporting them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Frowning, Seong Jihan became concerned.
 </p>
 <p>
  A cult believing in a player as a deity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Such movements were usually at the end times, and now humanity was thriving, climbing to 5th place. Why would a cult appear all of sudden?
 </p>
 <p>
  “I think I showed too much strength. Should I lose on purpose?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, Messiah! If you have started saving us, you must continue to the end!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. Uncle, since it’s come to this, climb to that divine throne!”
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…A divine throne? What are you talking about?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Daddy!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin, who had also been training individually, arrived at the BattleNet center, carrying two large bouquets.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Congratulations on joining the team, Seah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehe. Thanks.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Congratulations to you too, Akari.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank… you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Handing out bouquets, Yoon Sejin looked at Seong Jihan,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jihan, It seems I’m getting a lead on what you told me last time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you talking about focusing on each sword individually?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. I’m glad I listened to you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sword King of the previous life, went in the direction of focusing on the numbers of swords.
 </p>
 <p>
  Alone, it took a long time to find the way, but with Seong Jihan’s guidance, progress was swift.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems all our key players are here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, Coach Noh Youngjun approached with a smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re about to start analyzing Japan’s last game’s footage. Normally, you would not have to see it, but… How about it? Want to join us for the analysis?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh. I’d love to listen! I’ve been interested!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Japanese power analysis.
 </p>
 <p>
  Technically it was unnecessary given Japan’s lack of threat, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sure.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With practice hitting a wall, Seong Jihan entered the analysis room to get a change of perspective.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Why did they get so weak?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching Japan’s power in the footage, Seong Jihan wondered.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  =Everyone! The first Korea-Japan match of 2021 is upon us!
 </p>
 <p>
  =The Korean national team is sailing smoothly with 2 wins in the Northeast Asia League! Despite Seong Jihan’s absence, the second game against Taiwan was an easy win!
 </p>
 <p>
  =The double threat of Seong Jihan and the Sword King is so effective!
 </p>
 <p>
  =On the other hand, the Japanese team is not faring well with 0 wins and 2 losses. They suffered 3:0 losses to China and Russia too.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Northeast Asia League of 2021.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Korea cruises with 2 wins and no losses, Japan languishes at the bottom.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Their weakness lies in not having key players with high Gift ranks.
 </p>
 <p>
  =But wasn’t there a lack of high Gift rank players back in 2019 too? It seems Japan’s weaknesses have been magnified this year.
 </p>
 <p>
  =True. Even with the Sword King around, our win rate against Japan was only around 60%. The characteristic of Japan was having evenly strong abilities across all positions, even without a key player…
 </p>
 <p>
  =Now, their overall position strength is considered mediocre. To see such a change in two years… they desperately need an SSS-rank Gift holder now.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the BattleNet waiting room,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan listened to the Korean commentators and thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s not just the absence of a key player that’s the problem. All their players seem to have weakened.’
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  Between the last life and now, the only changes in Japan’s power were the Sword King’s return to Korea and Shizuru’s death.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sword King’s presence or absence wouldn’t sway the others’ levels,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Was Shizuru modifying other Japanese players too?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The editing gift was indeed overpowered.
 </p>
 <p>
  It would have been great had she used it benevolently for mankind.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘She wasn’t that kind of person.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With her ability, there’s no knowing what frivolous acts she would perform. Believing it was right to remove her, Seong Jihan watched the ban process.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Japan is preparing to use their ban card.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Who would they ban?
 </p>
 <p>
  =Surely, after Seong Jihan’s incredible performance in the previous matches, he’s the top candidate…
 </p>
 <p>
  =Exactly! He dominated the Space League, didn’t he?!
 </p>
 <p>
  While the commentators firmly expected Seong Jihan would be banned,
 </p>
 <p>
  =Uh, what? But… it’s Sword King Yoon Sejin’s name written on the ban card!
 </p>
 <p>
  The actual result was beyond prediction.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Expecting his participation, Yoon Sejin was startled by the commentators’ revelation as he held his twin swords.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even after viewing last week’s game,
 </p>
 <p>
  Why they wouldn’t ban Seong Jihan but instead him was puzzling.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What scheme are they planning…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who knows.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Outwardly playing ignorant, Seong Jihan inwardly speculated,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It must be Pythia’s doing.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia, who had proposed a meetup during the Korea-Japan match,
 </p>
 <p>
  Required Seong Jihan’s participation in the game as a prerequisite.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Something fishy’s going on. Be careful, Jihan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Addressing Yoon Sejin’s concerns, who was unaware of the subplot,
 </p>
 <p>
  “My first game with you, right uncle?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan joined the first set of Korea-Japan match with Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  =The map for game one is Southgate. It’s chosen by Japan!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah… facing Seong Jihan at Southgate? What in the world is the Japanese coach thinking?
 </p>
 <p>
  Southgate map, where Seong Jihan has continually shown exceptional performance.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed a self-destructive move for Japan to choose such an optimal map for a transcendent warrior like him.
 </p>
 <p>
  But…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Here! Right here!”
 </p>
 <p>
  At the start of the game atop the ramparts,
 </p>
 <p>
  A Japanese player suddenly appeared, waving at Seong Jihan,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah. It’s awkward to talk here, huh? Let me invite you to a better place.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  With a downward sweep of his hand,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Fall down, Apollo.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  A massive chariot of flames erupted from the sky,
 </p>
 <p>
  Crashing down upon the earth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom! Boom! Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  With a tremendous explosion, the ground shook.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fires surged, engulfing the Korean national team.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially,
 </p>
 <p>
  The flames wrapped around Seong Jihan at the forefront.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What… The fire isn’t extinguishing?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Heal, heal!”
 </p>
 <p>
  While the rest of the team struggled at the back against the fire,
 </p>
 <p>
  The lead flames did no harm to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [You are invited to ‘Fallen Apollo’s Sanctuary’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Will you accept the invitation?]
 </p>
 <p>
  A message of invitation appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The team will struggle a bit.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Fallen Apollo’s Sanctuary.
 </p>
 <p>
  It appeared like a Greco-style circular temple made entirely of fire.
 </p>
 <p>
  While created by Pythia solely to invite Seong Jihan,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… can’t fend off this fire…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Retreat back!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even the indirect influence of the fire from the temple overwhelmed the national team players.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether a prophet or not, the disciple of the Martial God certainly had power.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But they should manage. It’s their duty to overcome hurdles like this on their own.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As much as they couldn’t always be spoon-fed solutions,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I accept the invitation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan accepted the invitation to the sanctuary.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

  Chapter 235
 </p>
 <p>
  Moments ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, at the forefront with Akari, fought valiantly, taking down dozens of players, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve got you now!”
 </p>
 <p>
  In the end, she conceded distance.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kill her!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Japanese players, with infuriated expressions, drew their weapons.
 </p>
 <p>
  Akari put up a good fight but couldn’t block every player approaching.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  A gleaming blade lunged towards Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssshh!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Bye-bye~”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah stuck out her tongue playfully as she stepped into the veil of void.
 </p>
 <p>
  The blade sliced nothing but the empty air.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, out of thin air, only her bow appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Twang!
 </p>
 <p>
  The bowstring snapped, and a Japanese warrior was pierced through.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan had disappeared, and everybody thought the first set was a loss.
 </p>
 <p>
  But unexpectedly, Yoon Seah, joining the national team for the first time today, demonstrated a surprising performance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers from both nations had polarized reactions.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Seong Jihan disappeared, why…?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -What are the Japanese warriors doing? Can’t they handle one girl who’s debuting today?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Come on, win the first match!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Are they seriously going to waste the chance Mizuhara created…?
 </p>
 <p>
  With the game evening out after Seong Jihan’s disappearance, where Japanese viewers had briefly harbored hope, now they despaired.
 </p>
 <p>
  -I didn’t know Yoon Seah was such a good player!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Wow, really… these are some messed-up plays lol!!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -What was that? She can even dodge attacks from national-level players?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Is she hacking?
 </p>
 <p>
  Korean viewers, ready to concede the first game, were enthused, feeling like a new hero had joined their team.
 </p>
 <p>
  And so, unable to suppress Yoon Seah, the Japanese team increasingly found their numerical advantage shrinking.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssssh…
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan appeared out of nowhere, their expressions turned to despair.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Se-Seong Jihan… He’s back!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mizuhara is…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “She’s not here… was she taken down?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Da-dammit…! We should have finished it before he came back!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s… Let’s head for the fortress for now!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan appeared, the Japanese team began to back away.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite all their preparations, as they had originally intended to defend, everyone prepared to retreat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah. If I wipe them all out, will I take the MVP from you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah. Uncle. That’s a bit… it’s my debut match, let me have the MVP once.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan stroked his chin, then thrust his sword at the enemies.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fundamental Divine Arts, Annihilation God’s Secret – Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods.
 </p>
 <p>
  The shadow sword quickly transformed into a giant vortex.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh. Uh…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s a black vortex!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you get sucked in, you’re dead…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Resist it somehow!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The retreating Japanese players began to be drawn into it.
 </p>
 <p>
  They struggled to avoid being sucked into the Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods , but the strong suction made them float helplessly in mid-air.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods was slower than usual in absorbing them because Seong Jihan was in control of its power.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Before you get sucked in, take more of them out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, you’re giving me the chance? Got it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Determined to grab the MVP title in her debut game, Yoon Seah eagerly pulled her bowstring.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pluck! Pluck!
 </p>
 <p>
  One by one, the Japanese players were pierced.
 </p>
 <p>
  Difficult to block arrows while being caught in the vortex.
 </p>
 <p>
  Warriors could last a few rounds, but supporters and mages were straightforward targets.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This should secure the MVP for me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After counting the number of enemy players Seong Jihan had dispatched,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whissssh!
 </p>
 <p>
  He increased the suction strength of the Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods.
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  With that, the slowly drawn-in Japanese players were all swept into the vortex.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a flash, they were torn apart.
 </p>
 <p>
  = Player Seong Jihan wraps up the game immediately upon his return!
 </p>
 <p>
  = Was he controlling his power earlier, just to let Yoon Seah have the MVP title?
 </p>
 <p>
  = Truthfully, thanks to Yoon Seah buying time, the victory was assured even without the controlled effort…
 </p>
 <p>
  = Still, he made sure to buy the time!
 </p>
 <p>
  In the Space League, Seong Jihan demonstrated overwhelming strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having been temporarily sealed by the sudden emergence of a Japanese player, unable to use his powers.
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as he began to take full action, the first set ended rather uneventfully.
 </p>
 <p>
  =The MVP of the first game is…….
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah. Indeed, it goes to Yoon Seah!
 </p>
 <p>
  =She held her ground well on the frontlines in the first game together with player Akari!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Another prodigy appears on the Korean national team!
 </p>
 <p>
  The first match MVP went to Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Seong Jihan later piled up the kills, even without that, she had clearly earned her MVP title.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow… Yoon Seah is disgustingly powerful; an archer shielding warrior assaults at the frontline lol
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Why is everyone from that family like that?? What are they taking?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -The national team’s lineup is insane compared to a year ago lol
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Yeah, they ran at the bottom of the rankings until Seong Jihan showed up lol
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -I almost considered immigrating during those times.
 </p>
 <p>
  Entering 2021.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the Sword King joining and the emergence of a new talent Yoon Seah, the Korean national team significantly strengthened.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the other hand, the atmosphere on the Japanese side, without tangible reinforcements, was grim.
 </p>
 <p>
  -The chance Mizuhara created…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Ha, but we can win! Ban Seong Jihan, and Mizuhara can seal the Sword King!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -What about Yoon Seah then? She was the cause of the loss in the first set.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Ah… as expected, we can’t beat Korea.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Unless a supporter map is chosen, it’s impossible…
 </p>
 <p>
  Russia’s consistent victory card against Korea, the ‘Golem Duel’ supporter map, became Japan’s only hope.
 </p>
 <p>
  In Golem Duel, the supporter’s abilities alone determine the winner.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even with the monster-like Seong Jihan, he couldn’t dominate the game here.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om
 </p>
 <p>
  =The Japanese coach bans Seong Jihan and selects the Golem Duel map!
 </p>
 <p>
  =As expected…The first game was unusual! Japan’s supporter strength is definitely an advantage, making this their only winning formula.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Coach Noh Youngjun pulls out Southgate….
 </p>
 <p>
  =Oh… as expected. Japan selected the Golem Duel map!
 </p>
 <p>
  And then…
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Japanese coach got their desired Golem Duel map, Noh Youngjun’s brows furrowed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is… becoming a real problem every single time.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Golem Duel, a supporter map.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a map where victory was determined by golem versus golem, and where the player could only provide buffs and healing to their golem.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unable to partake in the combat themselves, it’s almost the only map where the all-encompassing Seong Jihan couldn’t wield his might, after Russia had fun with this map in a previous match.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ever since then, every country facing Korea prioritized this map.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah…….
 </p>
 <p>
  =Again, the Golem Duel map proves tough……!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Japan’s golem is putting serious pressure on ours……!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Korean national team couldn’t bridge the perceived gap in supporter strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  And they ended up facing defeat.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ah, really hate that map lol
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Can’t Seong Jihan participate in the Golem Duel?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -He doesn’t have supporter abilities, he’d be useless even if he did
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -That’s the only counter map for Seong Jihan lol
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Ah… at this rate, Seong Jihan. You have to charm Sophia! Naturalize her!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -He has a partner, right? lol
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -I authorize polygamy!
 </p>
 <p>
  After losing because of the Golem Duel in the second game.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Korean audience was like, oh well, too bad, bring over Sophia, but then…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh. Uh…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The third game also lands on the Golem Duel map!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the third game also fell onto the Golem Duel map, the mood became grim.
 </p>
 <p>
  -No… wait. Isn’t this statistically improbable……?
 </p>
 <br/>

 <p>
  -With a 70 percent probability on the select card to land a map. So each country’s probability is 35 percent, very possible…….
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -But two times in a row is a 12 percent chance…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -So, what’s the probability of the Golem Duel popping up again?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Multiply 35 percent three times and that’s 4 percent lol
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Ah f*ck… surely, we won’t hit that 4 percent, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks to the Japanese coach’s divine card drawing skills.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even as Coach Noh Youngjun banned Japan’s best supporter Sakura in response.
 </p>
 <p>
  = Ah…… We lost the third game.
 </p>
 <p>
  =With player Sakura banned, we might’ve thought we had a chance…
 </p>
 <p>
  = Still, our supporter strength is no match for Japan!
 </p>
 <p>
  The third game, just like the second, ended with the same result.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah. Uncle… Sophia says she wants to come to Korea, should we actively pursue her naturalization?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No need. Why bother with that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But really, if Golem Duel strikes three times in a row, isn’t that the end?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s the chance of that happening?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If only Jiah were here…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priestess Seong Jiah, who had shown remarkable abilities as a supporter.
 </p>
 <p>
  Had she been on the national team, they wouldn’t have been exploited so unilaterally.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unable to compete in two games, Seong Jihan and the group could only watch the screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  =The Japanese team has casually scored 2 wins with an air of ease!
 </p>
 <p>
  =On the flip side, Coach Noh Youngjun’s hands are trembling while picking the cards.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah, the Japanese coach picks Golem Duel again! How persistent!
 </p>
 <p>
  =No, but surely, it won’t be playing Golem Duel three times in a row… right?
 </p>
 <p>
  =There can’t be a fourth consecutive Golem Duel at 4 percent probability!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Just don’t land on it in the fourth game! No bans or select cards are given in the fifth game!
 </p>
 <p>
  And then the map for the fourth game was chosen.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah……!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The fates of the two coaches intertwined.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  The next day, at the Sword Palace Penthouse.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Republic of Korea struggles to win 3:2 against Japan!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Korea got toyed in the Golem Duel map! Weaknesses exposed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The only game Seong Jihan can’t partake in, Golem Duel map. What’s the counter strategy?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I really thought we were going to lose my debut game in a ridiculous way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah sighed deeply while reading the news articles.
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to when facing Japanese warriors, the moment the Japanese coach drew a card felt a hundred times more nerve-wracking.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh, I almost lost and went bankrupt…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Indeed, gambling is not a good idea for sure.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -I turned off the TV when drawing the cards because I was shaking so much. Lol.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -How can we not solve this Golem Duel map? Really want to ban the map itself ㅡㅡ
 </p>
 <p>
  After the intense card drawing by the Japanese coach yesterday, many people seemed to have their hearts pounding.
 </p>
 <p>
  Everyone was only talking about the Golem Duel map.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Japanese are criticizing the coach for not selecting the Golem Duel map from the first game.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Twice in a row was enough. They ask too much.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s it, uncle. Ah~ but my debut articles are buried because of that Golem Duel!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They aren’t gone, are they?”
 </p>
 <p>
  To the disappointed Yoon Seah, Seong Jihan pointed to the headlines on the portal site home page.
 </p>
 <p>
  [1st Game MVP Yoon Seah has a successful debut!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [1st Game MVP Yoon Seah. 4th Game MVP Yoon Sejin. 5th Game MVP Seong Jihan. The family takes turns claiming the MVP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The series MVP goes to Seong Jihan…]
 </p>
 <p>
  The news articles touched on Yoon Seah’s impressive debut at the Korea-Japan Series.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh… still, it feels like the limelight was stolen by the Golem Duel map.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She wasn’t satisfied with the amount of news coverage.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That can’t be helped. The game was almost lost, after all. Blame the Japanese coach’s card-picking skills.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It won’t do, uncle. Let’s bring Sophia over. With her, the Korea national team is sure to win.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No need. No need to bring her over.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Eh, but with Sophia, we could definitely win the championship!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah argued with disappointment, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll win even without her.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan waved it off, dismissing the idea.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Eh, but when you have a surefire card to win…”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Yoon Seah was about to express her dissatisfaction at Seong Jihan’s firm rejection, her phone vibrated.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh? Uncle. Sophia’s in Korea.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Why?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh? Uncle, Sophia says she’s in a hurry to see you. It’s really urgent regarding the Priestess.”
 </p>
 <p>
  An urgent matter……
 </p>
 <p>
  Something urgent… related to the Priestess.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright. Tell her to come over.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yep! I’ll let her know.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, Yoon Seah, right there and then, called Sophia.

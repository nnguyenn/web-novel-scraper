  Chapter 236
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jihan~”
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon arriving at the Sword Palace, Sophia waved cheerfully at Seong Jihan the moment she saw him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I watched the last match against Japan. How about it? You need me, don’t you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, not really.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why not!? There aren’t many supporters like me. Plus, in the Golem Duel, my gift will be as effective as if it’s SSS-rank, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia’s SS-rank gift, Trinity, enhanced all buff effects threefold.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a map like the Golem Duel, where only buffs and heals are applied, her gift proved even more effective than its original grade.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just tell me to come, and I’ll naturalize immediately! I’ve gotten better at speaking Korean too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s fine, really.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia, having been with the Daegi guild for a while, had quickly climbed to the Diamond League, surpassing her previous capabilities.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the United States, they were preparing for her possible recruitment as a supporter once her level rose slightly more.
 </p>
 <p>
  Actually, if it weren’t for the USA national team’s criteria of only choosing those above level 245,
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia would have been selected long ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thump! Thump!
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching this from the side, Yoon Seah nudged Seong Jihan in the ribs.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle… Sophia wants to come over so much, bring her now! If the USA team recruits her first, it’ll be harder to get her!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I won’t bring her.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t get it… With her, isn’t it a confirmed win for Korea in the Champions League?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s what I’m saying! We can win for the first time as a third world country!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Winning the Champions League.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although its value had declined since the inauguration of the Space League in 2020,
 </p>
 <p>
  it remained a goal every player dreamt of and sought to achieve.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah couldn’t understand why her uncle was stubborn when a shortcut to victory was right before them.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Yoon Seah patted her chest in frustration, Seong Jihan spoke up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t want to poach talent from another country.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Think about your dad.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… Dad was enchanted, but this is her choice!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right! I just want to come to Korea because I like you, Seong Jihan!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s why it’s troublesome.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia’s one-sided favor.
 </p>
 <p>
  For Seong Jihan, who might have to face death at any moment as the Martial God, there was no room to accept it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Besides, she’s even more aggressive than in my past life.’
 </p>
 <p>
  For now, it’s overlooked as there’s distance between Korea and the USA.
 </p>
 <p>
  If she naturalizes to South Korea and they got closer, it’ll be harder to push her away.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Plus, I can’t tell Sophia to leave her family and come to Korea just for the Champions League.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s about time I become independent anyway! My parents will surely understand!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It doesn’t matter. I won’t accept it even if you come.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow… that’s so mean! Didn’t you say you’d accept me if I become the top supporter?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Compete for the top spot first, then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh… why let this opportunity slip…”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan rebuffed the eager SS-rank supporter, Yoon Seah felt a tinge of regret.
 </p>
 <p>
  With Sophia in the national team, victory seemed within grasp.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sigh… Usually, you’d be the one asking me. That’s a pity. What if I get recruited by the USA team?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, nothing can be done then. So… was the urgent matter about naturalization?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia cast a sidelong glance at Seong Jihan, trying to change the subject, then wore a serious expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No. My personal desire for naturalization is separate… ”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then what is it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve received a revelation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A revelation, you say?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A revelation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even for a Priestess class, could such a thing be possible?
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking puzzled, Seong Jihan listened as Sophia lowered her voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Priestess Jeanne D’arc appeared in my dream.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jeanne D’arc?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jeanne D’arc was the priestess who had led France to victory but ended up condemned to the flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I never heard Sophia mention Jeanne D’arc in my previous life.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Why would she suddenly appear in her dream now?
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Initially, Seong Jihan thought it was another difference from his previous life.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…So, Jeanne D’arc says she’ll help lighten the burden of the priestess engulfed in the void.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Sophia began to describe the revelation of Jeanne D’arc, he felt a strange sense of déjà vu.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it’s the priestess engulfed in the void, it must refer to his sister, Seong Jiah.
 </p>
 <p>
  And to lessen her burden…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It sounds similar to what Pythia said.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia claimed that upon awakening Gilgamesh’s authority, the fifth Annihilation Technique, she would help lift the burden of the Witch of The Void, Seong Jiah.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, Jeanne D’arc in Sophia’s dream was saying something in a similar context.
 </p>
 <p>
  Till then, Seong Jihan was skeptical.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…And, Jeanne D’arc stated that if you hear about this, you will know what it means.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “And?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “She declared confidence in you keeping your promise and said she’d prepare a space in advance for it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. She intends to pass the Holy Flame to me for that purpose.”
 </p>
 <p>
  By now, he was convinced of Jeanne D’arc’s identity.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Was Jeanne D’arc, Pythia?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Nostradamus, Jeanne D’arc.
 </p>
 <p>
  He wondered since when had the Prophet undertaken the role of a priestess.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Since her actual power was water rather than fire, she’s preparing to transfer the energy she accumulated to Sophia, isn’t she…?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recalled Pythia’s power.
 </p>
 <p>
  The intensity of the flames in the fallen sanctuary of Apollo.
 </p>
 <p>
  Such a potent force, being passed on to Sophia just like that?
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Holy Flame… Won’t it be dangerous?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah! Are you worried about it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehe. Don’t worry! Jeanne D’arc said she couldn’t pass too much at once. She said it will build up slowly, so I’ll have time to adapt easily.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia’s face brightened as Seong Jihan showed concern.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah watched her from the side, shaking her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sophia… Honestly. Getting pleased by just one word from him, what will you do in the future? You’ll end up being led around by him!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s okay. I want to keep being led around by him!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh. Seriously… What’s so great about the uncle?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why? He’s the world’s greatest warrior. The coolest in the world.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Sigh. Forget it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah gave up on advising Sophia.
 </p>
 <p>
  What’s the point of playing hard to get when she’s so straightforward?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, even if you say that, I don’t plan on dragging her around.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s okay. You’ll see my face often from now on! You’ll naturally be drawn to me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Aren’t you going to the United States?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia responded to Seong Jihan’s question by smiling bright and open while spreading her palm.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whooosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, a small white flame sprouted lively from her hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jeanne D’arc said that to fully transfer her Holy Flame, I need to be near the Abyss.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Abyss in North Korean land, you mean?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. She mentioned that preparations must be made here for a definite sharing of the burden…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Expecting Seong Jihan to awaken the abilities of Gilgamesh early, that’s why Pythia was diligently making preparations.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan mused,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘She’s really keen on it. We haven’t even found a clue on our side yet.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The fifth Annihilation Technique, associated with the Wood attribute.
 </p>
 <p>
  He knew about its elemental alignment, but beyond that, there wasn’t a lead to follow.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, on their end,
 </p>
 <p>
  Expectations were that Seong Jihan, who completed the Ice Heaven Sword Rain quickly, could also swiftly achieve it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, it seems I need to stay in Korea a little longer to accept the Holy Flame~”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, Sophia. Is the Korean national team coming too?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes… initially, I planned to stop everything once Seong Jihan asked.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Flick!
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia twisted her body as the Holy Flame, unable to sustain itself long, extinguished in her palm.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you okay, Sophia?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… indeed it’s challenging. I need to get used to managing this fire; I’ll consider the next steps afterward.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia’s flame.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even Seong Jihan had to counter it through Ice Heaven Sword Rain before it became quenchable.
 </p>
 <p>
  For Sophia to inherit and wield such power wouldn’t be an easy task.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia winked at Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s most important to receive Jeanne D’arc’s flame right now, right? For your mother… and for the elder brother too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm, elder brother?”
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  “Yeah. It’s not just for husbands and older sisters; you can call them elder brother too, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Saying that, she tilted her head with a smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But isn’t ‘elder brother’ something men call each other? Why is a woman using ‘elder brother’?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, um… Anyway! Since my elder brother acknowledged me as his sister-in-law. I need to do my best too!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Brimming with determination, Sophia clenched her fists.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, grateful for her efforts to save her mother, thought, ‘Seah. You can call her auntie in advance.’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Nah,I’m fine!’
 </p>
 <p>
  She felt goosebumps at the thought of calling her friend “auntie”.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan. I’ll borrow one of the rooms in Sword Palace then~”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Fine with me. The building owner is Seah anyway.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah. That’s right~ Sophia. Want to go see the rooms? I’ll give you the best one!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sure, let’s go!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, it was nice of her to offer help in saving Seong Jiah.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, Yoon Seah decided to personally show Sophia the best room in the Sword Palace and they left.
 </p>
 <p>
  Left alone, Seong Jihan spent a moment quietly observing the house and thought,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Since Pythia is so keen, I need to hasten my training on Gilgamesh’s authority.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The fifth Annihilation Technique associated with the Wood attribute.
 </p>
 <p>
  Wondering how to attempt it, an idea struck him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll try utilizing the energy of life.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The World Tree could be considered the epitome of the Wood attribute.
 </p>
 <p>
  Could there be an intersection with the Wood attribute and the life energy it held?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘In the absence of clues, it’s worth a shot to try anything.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, Seong Jihan began his attempt at the fifth Annihilation Technique, skipping the usual order.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile,
 </p>
 <p>
  In the Abode of the Martial God,
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak, an old man with a white mane, stroked his beard while holding his smartphone.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Pythia… has she lost the will to fight?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Korea vs. Japan match ended at 3:2.
 </p>
 <p>
  The scores alone showed a close game.
 </p>
 <p>
  But it was the Japanese coach’s luck in card selection that narrowly edged the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  In terms of power, Japan was no match for Korea.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the supporter Mizuhara Aoi showed a strong fire power in the first game.
 </p>
 <p>
  She had been quiet since the second.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Through the Eye of Divination, she must have seen something in him…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  As Pythia appeared from the vast void, Dongbang Sak took his eyes off the smartphone and looked at her.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Pythia… why did you spare him?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I saw something amazing in him.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You were supposed to teach him a lesson.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll leave that to you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, Pythia spread out one finger.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Dongbang Sak,… can you defeat Seong Jihan in one minute?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “One minute?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. On a full power basis.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak twisted his beard, lost in thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Full power… has the fighting spirit of the Eye of Divination disappeared?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You know well, if I use full power, it will end in a single strike.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak said nonchalantly.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om
 </p>
 <p>
  As certain and routine as the sunrise from the east.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That wouldn’t be a lesson, would it? I wouldn’t have fun either.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Still! I made a bet with him. If he lasts a minute, I’ll have to give a free prophecy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You crafted quite the trick… what did you get in return?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If I win, he’ll tell me all his martial art names.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The name of the martial art.
 </p>
 <p>
  Behind Dongbang Sak, the Taiji symbol appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Initially rotating clockwise, the black and white pattern of the Taiji,
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you tell me too, I’ll use my full power.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [TL/N: Taiji means Yin and Yang powers, but its too long so i put taiji]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good.”
 </p>
 <p>
  then began to rotate counter-clockwise.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I guess I’ll have to bring out the Taiji Demon Sword after a long time.”

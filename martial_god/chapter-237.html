  Chapter 237
 </p>
 <p>
  A week later.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ding-dong. Ding-dong.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sitting on the living room sofa sipping coffee, Yoon Sejin heard the ringing from the wall pad and looked at Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is it Sophia?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, Dad. I’ll go check.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, now accustomed to these visits, walked to the entrance and opened the door.
 </p>
 <p>
  There stood Sophia, dolled up with her makeup on point.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hi, Seah~”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, I’ve been seeing you a lot lately, huh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A week after moving into Sword Palace, Sophia had been visiting the penthouse every day around 3 PM.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is Jihan perhaps here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle’s not here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not here? Again?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. He’s training.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really? Should I come before 3 PM? But Jeanne D’arc’s transfer of the Holy Flame doesn’t end until then…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia had been visiting the penthouse every day for a week, mainly to see Seong Jihan, but she had been missing him every time.
 </p>
 <p>
  And that was because…
 </p>
 <p>
  “No. It wouldn’t matter what time you come… Uncle just doesn’t come out of the training room.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not… for a whole week? What about food?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Food? He’s not eating.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Eeeek?! What if he faints?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “For uncle, we don’t need to worry. Plus…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah shook her head, looking towards the direction of the training room.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems like he’s not there either. No sign of him at all.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where did he go?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I heard he got access to a training space where time flows differently. When I asked to go with him, he said only he can enter.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow… such a place exists?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. So I’ll let you know when he comes back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Tch. I was expecting to see Jihan a lot… Okay!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia left after another day of futility.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Yoon Seah returned to the living room, Yoon Sejin, who had been drinking coffee, remarked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That girl really never gives up, huh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re not the one to talk, Dad.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It reminds me of when I followed your mother around.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But wasn’t Mom underage then?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Cough… maybe I need to go level up a bit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Startled by the mention of underage, Yoon Sejin rose from the sofa.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah smiled mischievously, then looked back at the training room.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But really, when is uncle coming out?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Since Seong Jihan acquired the training hall of the void, he had become a recluse in his training room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lately, Seong Jihan’s viewers were even flocking to Yoon Seah’s BattleTube channel asking when he’ll stream again.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Though it helped increase my subscribers… now they fight amongst themselves.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Since Seong Jihan had overwhelmingly more fans, each time Yoon Seah streamed games, the chat would be flooded with questions about “When will Mr. Seong Jihan come?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Those against searching for Seong Jihan on her channel were clashing fiercely with those just looking for updates.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah eventually gave up moderating the chaotic chatroom.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Today’s game stream… I’ll probably have to deal with uncle’s fans again… Maybe I should turn off the chat.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah mused this with a wry smile when,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Someone is looking for me? Who?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Behind her, without any prior indication, Seong Jihan appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, uncle! You’re finally out?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. How long has it been?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A week. Did your training go well?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan shook his head at Yoon Seah’s question.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not really.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The fifth Annihilation technique, Descend of the Heavenly Tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  Armed only with the clue that it’s a martial art of the Wood attribute related to Gilgamesh, Seong Jihan gave it a shot in the void training hall. Despite spending a significant amount of time, he made no progress.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There seems to be some connection between Heavenly Tree and the Martial Arts of the Wood Attribute…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Heavenly Tree, Initially, Seong Jihan thought it functioned as some kind of buff.
 </p>
 <p>
  Usually, descent implies gods bestowing their strength upon the user for a certain period, enhancing them.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But the last martial art of Annihilation technique to be a buff type? That doesn’t seem right…’
 </p>
 <p>
  While not backed by hard evidence, Seong Jihan’s instincts told him that the Descend of Heavenly Tree was not merely that type of power.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having explored other directions but always failing, he stepped out of the void training hall for a breather.

 <p>
  “What’s this chat about from earlier?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh. Nothing much. Just that your fans have been coming to my channel looking for you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really? Well, I’ve been doing fewer streams lately.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ever since becoming the hidden boss, Seong Jihan had stopped regular gaming.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because not only was the hidden boss garnering a lot of experience, but if he joined the race to level up, He would quickly become world number one.
 </p>
 <p>
  He would then be the focus of concentrated bans during the Space League, so he was regulating his pace.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do they not somewhat know the situation?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But they are curious about what you’re doing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve said I’ve been training.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “And I’ve said it over a hundred times too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sorry if it caused any trouble.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, it’s fine. Thanks to that, many of the viewers who came ended up subscribing to my channel…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thriving from her recent victories in BattleTube, Yoon Seah was gaining subscribers amongst Seong Jihan’s fans, enjoying the spillover benefits.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, she seemed somewhat hassled by the chat.
 </p>
 <p>
  Noticing her dim expression, Seong Jihan patted her on the head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You won’t be bothered by the chat today.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh? Why?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Because I’m going to play today.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh… but I thought you couldn’t level up? If you become number one in the Space League, that wouldn’t be good, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was going to do that, but this special map’s rewards are quite unique.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, what’s it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll show you in the game.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan said with a grin and entered BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  ***
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hello, everyone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon accessing BattleNet, Seong Jihan immediately turned on BattleTube.
 </p>
 <p>
  -What? Seriously, it’s Seong Jihan?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Oh… the notification popped out of nowhere, and it’s actually him?!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Ah, finally you logged in to BattleTube… Did you finish your training?
 </p>
 <p>
  Immediately as Seong Jihan launched the game, the chatroom brimmed with welcoming messages.
 </p>
 <p>
  Amid the flurry of fleeting comments, Seong Jihan began to speak.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  “Training is an ongoing process, but Space 4 has assigned me to another special map.”
 </p>
 <p>
  -Another special map?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -It’s special every time
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Doesn’t surprise me anymore that it’s Seong Jihan lol
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -So does that mean another hidden boss appearance?
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers were no longer impressed by the assignment to a special map.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead, it was almost expected, to the point where it’d seem strange to see him in an ordinary game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile…
 </p>
 <p>
  [A.DaVVies has donated 100000 GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Uh, Mr. Seong Jihan, we are really sorry, but you know the Space League isn’t far away.. could you somehow… perhaps stay at the 2nd place this time……?]
 </p>
 <p>
  -The human coach donated lol
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Donating while asking to keep a check on leveling up lol
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -He did enjoy the recent 1st-place fake stunt.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Really, if only Seong Jihan could stay forever below 2nd for the Space League…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Isn’t Seong Jihan now ranked 7th because of the hidden boss?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Even without playing the main game, he’s at that level? He must have earned a lot of experience points.
 </p>
 <p>
  Davis, who had greatly deceived Orcs, thinking Seong Jihan would naturally be first, appealed to him to somehow use similar tactics in the next game, even sponsoring him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have no plans to become world number one right now. I’m trying to hold back on leveling up as much as I can. It’s just that this special map has quite a unique reward. I have to participate.”
 </p>
 <p>
  People showed interest in Seong Jihan’s response.
 </p>
 <p>
  -If Seong Jihan says the reward is good…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Was it as good as when the hidden boss popped up last time?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -What exactly are the rewards?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just that…”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was about to reply,
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  [Oh. Welcome back, our esteemed customer. Long time no see.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  A giant robot appeared beside him and started speaking.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Artemus?”
 </p>
 <p>
  There stood Artemus, the greatest blacksmith in the universe, in its combined form.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes.]
 </p>
 <p>
  His body glowed, then split into hundreds of dwarves who lined up neatly on the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Are you also participating because of your membership, customer?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [So am I. Can’t miss out on a 6-month extension.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The basic reward of the special map was a Space League Premier Membership extension voucher.
 </p>
 <p>
  An item inherently equipped with a function of 100 percent boost in experience and GP gain.
 </p>
 <p>
  In fact, it was often chosen not only for that but for a 30 percent chance of evading the opponent’s ban list and for particular functions like ‘Spotlight’ or ‘Hideout.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [Are you planning to extend the hideout this time too?]
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  “That’s the plan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [If someone as talented as you used the Spotlight, you would have received universal attention. With GP sponsorship flooding in, and many constellations calling for your love, you’d be overwhelmed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you planning to use the Spotlight?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Of course. I need to gather GP to modify my race.]
 </p>
 <p>
  -Spotlight? Hideout?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -What are they talking about?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan explained briefly to the viewers who were not familiar with the Space League membership card.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh, so that’s why they couldn’t see Seong Jihan’s face.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -I thought the aliens were talking nonsense lol
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -And it seems he wasn’t banned due to that too.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -It seems worth joining .
 </p>
 <p>
  Although viewers took the explanation about the membership card quite casually.
 </p>
 <p>
  [A.DaVVies has donated 100000 GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Sir, Mr. Seong Jihan, does the membership card reduce the chance of being banned?! But it seems like it hasn’t been applied even once during the national games…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Coach Davis from humanity’s representative team excitedly made another donation with his query.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, sharing the same doubts about the 30 percent ban evasion, asked Artemus who was standing beside him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But Artemus, this 30 percent ban evasion thing… is it effective? I don’t recall it ever working for me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Really? I’ve made quite a profit off it. When was it you faced trouble?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “In national competitions. I’m always under concentrated bans.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […National competitions? Does your planet, which your race rules, have several countries?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Huh. Of course, that doesn’t work then. Is that a real game, competing against your own race? That’s just part of training. But… What did you even do? You should declare immediate world unification and become a dictator.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Hundreds of dwarves, sounding incredulous, simultaneously shrugged and stared at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “A dictator, what nonsense are you on about?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’re the one talking nonsense. To join Space 4 as a lowest-tier race, you’ve got to have celestial genes. You must not stop there; it’s your duty to evolve your race. Unify the world and spread your superior genes to all prolific women!]
 </p>
 <p>
  -The guy’s lost it…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -What’s this world unification joke? lol
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -But seriously, if Seong Jihan tried to unify the world, would anyone be able to stop him? lol
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Can’t they just bomb him?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Seong Jihan could probably dodge a nuke…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -His spatial control ability is brokenly overpowered, isn’t it?
 </p>
 <p>
  As the chat began to seriously debate whether world unification by Seong Jihan was feasible, Seong Jihan immediately waved his hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry. I have no thoughts of world unification.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tsk. One should dedicate themselves to one’s race… What a waste of ability.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Why bother with such tedious affairs?
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan flatly denied it, Artemus kept nagging aside,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Player has been assigned to special invade map, ‘Race Annihilation Battle.’]
 </p>
 <p>
  The system message appeared and the chit chat stopped as focus shifted to it.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The designated race is the ‘Blue Blood Demons’ demoted from the Silver League.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Divided between ‘Void’ and ‘Solar’ factions, the process of clearing the demotion planet begins.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Will you participate in the ‘Race Annihilation Battle’?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Race Annihilation Battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, having only thought of it as a special invade map before participating in the game, furrowed his brow at the revealed name of the map.

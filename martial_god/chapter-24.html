 <h3>
  Chapter 24
 </h3>
 <p>
  [Translator – Zain]
 </p>
 <p>
  ***
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers were stirred by Seong Jihan’s declaration to go down the tower alone.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ah-ah-ah!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Is another person going to be added to the list of Gangnam’s top three trolls?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Haha, we can’t lose to the trolls! We don’t need teamwork here!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Sh$%^&amp;!!!!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Looks like today we’re checking the status window!”
 </p>
 <p>
  – It looks like we’re going to see his status window today!
 </p>
 <p>
  Their reactions were understandable because, in the ’10 Towers’ defense map, countless zombies crawled around at the bottom of the towers. It was truly hell.
 </p>
 <p>
  Going down alone?
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how skilled Seong Jihan might be outside the norm, this was akin to saying he would commit suicide.
 </p>
 <p>
  – A Bronze player can be revived in the defense map. After being revived, he will probably fight properly from above, saying something like, “It seems like it still isn’t possible yet~”
 </p>
 <p>
  – Can you revive in Bronze? I didn’t know since I don’t watch Bronze.
 </p>
 <p>
  – I guess he’s doing it for entertainment purposes.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the excitement of the people subsided shortly.
 </p>
 <p>
  When it became known that Bronze players had a total of 3 chances to respawn, everyone concluded that Jihan’s arrogance was meant to entertain people. No one thought that he was serious about going down to kill a thousand zombies.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan, you’re truly a professional broadcaster…To think you would go down there alone!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Golden Light also thought that Jihan’s sacrifice came from the attitude of a professional entertainer.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although he’d been killed by him previously, he has become one of his fans after seeing him fight.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll be filming from above until you come back. Viewers of Seong Jihan , if you want to see him fight from a different angle, please visit my channel!” Golden Light blatantly advertised himself, assuming Jihan would die.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright. I’ll leave the top to you, and as for the Mage… Are you going to play properly this time?” Jihan’s cold eyes bored into Kim Gyuhyuk.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gyuhyuk choked up for a moment as he remembered what had happened before.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Fuck. How dare someone who said he’s going down lecture me on how to play properly? Supports should just give buffs. Why’s he wielding a sword and causing a fuss?!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite such thoughts, Kim Gyuhyuk weakly nodded his head outwardly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, of course.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Mage Kim Gyuhyuk, adept at anger management.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since the incident when he was utterly defeated by Seong Jihan, he had been very good at controlling his anger.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the other hand, Diego Mashid, who hadn’t experienced playing with Seong Jihan, had a quite normal attitude towards him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Support. Buff. Give.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He demanded a buff from Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “To think he’s asking me for a buff. It feels quite unfamiliar.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He’d only received buffs. He’d never given them.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But since the Force has Divine Power in it…’
 </p>
 <p>
  His Force was at 14, so he could use buffs that he couldn’t before due to the lack of Divine Power.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Power Up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The skills he’d obtained as Support were Heal, Power Up, and Barrier, and Sung Jihan used Power Up on all three players.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Woah. So you really were a Support!! To think you’d use Power Up, and on top of that, the performance is great!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good buff.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pang. Pang.
 </p>
 <p>
  Diego Masid’s soccer ball flew high into the sky thanks to the buff.
 </p>
 <p>
  It could’ve been because, just like Martial Power, Force was also a unique stat, but the effect of Power Up was too good for 14 points of Divine Power.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Protect the crystal and survive the zombie attack.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The battle will continue until 5 towers are left.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the game began…
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll be going.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Woosh-
 </p>
 <p>
  JiHan, who was standing at the top of the tower, jumped straight down.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  At the same time, Diego’s mouth fell open when he saw how the Support jumped off the tower.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is he crazy?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. He’s crazy,” Gyuhyuk answered while nodding vigorously. Then he quickly ran toward the tower’s edge to look down at where Jihan had fallen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just like what had happened to him, he wanted to watch the zombies surround and kill Jihan, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  The sight unfolding beneath the Tower was…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Crazy…”
 </p>
 <p>
  It was crazy in an entirely different sense.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  The power that dominated space, Force.
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren, the first to handle this power, had always complained.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Force is too difficult to handle. Especially controlling space… It’s almost ineffective against high-ranking players.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When it came to top-ranked players representing each country, they were all formidable and easily resisted space control.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Of course, the biggest problem was Barren’s lack of control.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps due to his exceptional gifts, Barren had consistently grown without much difficulty, overpowering opponents with his stats until he reached Rank 1.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if his spatial control wasn’t effective, the power of Ultra Magic Power, a fusion of Divine Power and Magic, remained robust.
 </p>

 <p>
  Thus, he grew to become Earth’s strongest damage dealer, flourishing like a flower in a greenhouse.
 </p>
 <p>
  If Earth hadn’t been included in the Space League, he might have been content to remain at Rank 1 while living within the greenhouse.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But in battles against extraterrestrial beings, he was utterly powerless.’
 </p>
 <p>
  However, when Earth started competing in the interstellar league with beings from other planets…
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren’s overpowering strength on Earth only translated to being remarkable in the Space League. His hidden weaknesses became apparent.
 </p>
 <p>
  To be precise, it was his lack of control and his vulnerability to attacks.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jihan, Let’s practice!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren had called upon Seong Jihan countless times to practice and overcome these weaknesses, but he couldn’t easily eliminate them.
 </p>
 <p>
  If Barren had managed to overcome these weaknesses, Earth might not have faced relegation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Nevertheless, my role as Barren’s partner back then is proving helpful now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was quickly falling from the tower.
 </p>
 <p>
  Below, zombies crowded together without any room to spare.
 </p>
 <p>
  At this rate, a collision with the zombies was inevitable.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Fire.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a single word, Seong Jihan extended his hand and flames erupted.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The heads of the zombies waiting below burst into flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  Basic magic of the Mage class, Fire.
 </p>
 <p>
  It could only conjure flames near the hand, and if the casting distance increased even a bit, the flames would weaken and extinguish quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  No mage had ever used this magic for offensive purposes.
 </p>
 <p>
  But Seong Jihan’s Fire was different.
 </p>
 <p>
  The flames that erupted simultaneously even from a distance were not only stronger than if he had conjured them directly, but they also radiated a powerful white light due to the fusion of Magic and Divine power.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  Furthermore, perhaps due to the power of Sanctity, which was the opposite of the zombies’ nature, the white flames were instantly reducing the zombies’ bodies to ashes.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Not bad.’

   Though his Force stat was only 14, the range of the Absolute Domain was limited to 1.4 meters.

  <p>
   But that wasn’t all.
  </p>
  <p>
   Zombies that were slightly touched by the sword line emitted white light from their bodies and turned into dust.
  </p>
  <p>
   Seeing this, Seong Jihan nodded subtly.
  </p>
  <p>
   “As expected. Combining it with Marial Power is better.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Using the power of Force alone for Fire was less destructive than combining Martial Power and Force to emit a Sword Ki from the sword.
  </p>
  <p>
   Swoosh-
  </p>
  <p>
   After he confirmed its destructive capabilities, Jihan’s sword began dancing, and the chat window also started to dance with comments.
  </p>
  <p>
   – ?¿?¿?¿?¿?¿?¿?¿?¿?
  </p>
  <p>
   – What’s this? What in the world is this? Seriously, what is this!!!
  </p>
  <p>
   – This goes beyond common sense!
  </p>
  <p>
   – If we empty our thoughts, it makes sense!
  </p>
  <p>
   In just a few seconds, dozens of zombies turned to dust and vanished.
  </p>
  <p>
   Everything happened in the blink of an eye.
  </p>
  <p>
   ‘120 kills.’
  </p>
  <p>
   The score on the scoreboard was already showing 120 kills.
  </p>
  <p>
   This achievement was possible thanks to the densely packed zombies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Looking at other Towers where the recorded kills were still around 10 or 12, Seong Jihan’s overwhelming performance was remarkable.
  </p>
  <p>
   Even if he continued to face the incoming zombies from this spot, achieving the goal of 1,000 kills seemed quite possible.
  </p>
  <p>
   However…
  </p>
  <p>
   “It won’t work at this rate.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Seong Jihan’s goal was the linked quest. He didn’t know what quest would come after clearing this quest. Therefore, Seong Jihan quickly moved to achieve the 1,000 kills.
  </p>
  <p>
   While staying in this position allowed him to fight without being surrounded, it wasn’t a viable option for Seong Jihan in his current state with both impotence and Force.
  </p>
  <p>
   Whoosh!
  </p>
  <p>
   Seong Jihan’s body shot forward like a cannonball.
  </p>
  <p>
   Whoosh!
  </p>
  <p>
   Although the zombies targeted him from all sides, just a few movements of the sword were enough to cut them all in half.
  </p>
  <p>
   No matter how effective the tactics might be, they were only feasible when there was a certain level of difference in strength. This situation was akin to an ant swarm attacking a lion.
  </p>
  <p>
   – Wow, He reached 300 kills in an instant.
  </p>
  <p>
   – Others are only at 30 or 40 kills… He’s single-handedly crushing them down
  </p>
  <p>
   – To think he alone could reach more than 500 kills… Is he even human?
  </p>
  <p>
   Viewers watching Seong Jihan’s unmatched performance were stunned by the kill score displayed.
  </p>
  <p>
   – He’s strong, but this is too much, right?
  </p>
  <p>
   In a Defense Map designed for team play, Seong Jihan was sweeping away the zombies effortlessly on his own.
  </p>
  <p>
   Even the troublesome Blood Zombies from the Defense Map were appearing endlessly, but…
  </p>
  <p>
   – Crazy! He’s even taking down the Blood Zombies in a single hit!
  </p>
  <p>
   It was utterly frustrating to see dozens of Blood Zombies, who were about to swarm Seong Jihan from the air, falling like flies.
  </p>
  <p>
   In that state, they all crashed to the ground.
  </p>
  <p>
   Though the range of the Absolute Domain was only 1.4 meters, the area where the power of Force could exert dominance was wider, making this possible.
  </p>
  <p>
   – Wow… What in the world is this?
  </p>
  <p>
   – Even if it’s a garbage game with terrible balance, this is going overboard, isn’t it? He hasn’t been hit even once. Is this real?
  </p>
  <p>
   – It might be faster to gather subscribers if we want to see his status screen – Lol. I’m willing to bet all my belongings that JiHan’s Gift is SSS-rank.
  </p>
  <p>
   – Hey, you think that too?”
  </p>
  <p>
   The viewers were all in a state of disbelief when Seong Jihan’s kill count passed 700.
  </p>
  <p>
   While other Towers hadn’t even achieved a combined total of 100 kills, Seong Jihan had already recorded over seven times that amount.
  </p>
  <p>
   – This isn’t Telekinesis…
  </p>
  <p>
   – A Mage using Divine Power? That’s impossible…
  </p>
  <p>
   – On top of that, his potential as a Warrior is top-notch. He’s insane!
  </p>
  <p>
   The scouts who were watching Seong Jihan were exhilarated and ecstatic.
  </p>
  <p>
   It was an unconventional power.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m
  </p>
  <p>
   Moreover, this was something that not even the previous Sword King Yun Sejin could perceive when he was still a Bronze rank.
  </p>
  <p>
   If they could recruit Seong Jihan…
  </p>
  <p>
   The rankings of Korean guilds could completely change.”
  </p>
  <p>
   ‘No matter what it takes, we must recruit Seong Jihan!’
  </p>
  <p>
   Among these scouts, only one person’s gaze remained chillingly calm.
  </p>
  <p>
   ‘You can’t… If you continue doing this, it’ll attract way too much attention.’

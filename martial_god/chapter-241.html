  Chapter 241
 </p>
 <p>
  The hidden boss Seong Jihan was known throughout the cosmos for his one-hit kills, his stats were rated: EX in offense, A in defense, but F in vitality.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the skills possessed by the hidden boss Seong Jihan, there was only one skill for defense: the Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The vortex is weakening…!’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘At this rate, the hidden boss will be captured!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Once the Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods faded, a creature with an F-rated vitality would surely meet its end. Down below, the players couldn’t help but grow anxious.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though they didn’t understand why the fatal blow hadn’t struck yet, that wasn’t the issue at hand. If they left things as they were, the Black Dragon might snatch the reward.
 </p>
 <p>
  And so,
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  The giant kicked the Black Dragon away.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What the hell are you doing!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The hidden boss is mine!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How dare you touch my prey!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Following this collision, the players started fighting each other. Assuming Seong Jihan was already secured like a caught fish, they entered fierce battles to claim the spoils for themselves.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why are they fighting among themselves?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Isn’t it obvious? They’re fighting over the rewards for the Seong Jihan raid lol
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -This is pure chaos lol
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -But these guys… They’re on a whole different level compared to the players we’ve seen so far, right?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -The sky is practically falling;
 </p>
 <p>
  Dragons clashed with giants.
 </p>
 <p>
  Enormous mythical birds collided with smoke-formed figures.
 </p>
 <p>
  The atmosphere, frozen solid by Seong Jihan’s Ice Heaven Sword Rain, was shattered and melted.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ensuing conflict caused the earth itself to tremble.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Monsters…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How can we fight such beings…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Blue Blood Demons on the ground felt their fighting spirit wane. The players aiming at Seong Jihan were all so strong that Sword Rain had tagged them as bug-level threats.
 </p>
 <p>
  To a third party, the scene looked like deities throwing a fit.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master… this is our chance. Should we escape while they clash?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Amid the chaos of fighting players, Ariel suggested to Seong Jihan that they use this moment to flee.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though these opponents wouldn’t let them get away easily, if Seong Jihan made a full-powered escape, there was a chance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Besides,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Won’t we manage better with that suspecting Death star constellation?”
 </p>
 <p>
  A suspicious ally perhaps, but still a constellation that offered its assistance for now. If they could get out of this environment surrounded by bug-level players, a path would open.
 </p>
 <p>
  Escaping was the most logical evaluation of the current situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Escape? Why would I?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan chose to take up arms.
 </p>
 <p>
  “On the contrary, I couldn’t have asked for a better situation. I haven’t had the opportunity to fight strong opponents, but now they’ve finally come to me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Recent opponents, none of them became a real threat to him.
 </p>
 <p>
  The only significant damage he received was from Longinus’ Divine Spear, and even the Orc chieftain in the Space League was no threat.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even Artemus, who was contesting the status of the hidden boss, couldn’t match Seong Jihan in terms of strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Now, there’s a limit to improvement through training alone. I need to fight strong opponents to develop further.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially, in preparation for the upcoming battle against Dongbangsak in the national representative match.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had to keep pursuing power growth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle…
 </p>
 <p>
  Crimson lightning gathered at the tip of Seong Jihan’s spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fundamental divine art, Fusion of Divine thunder and phoenix: Crimson Thunder cannon
 </p>
 <p>
  The massive lightning bolt struck the players.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rumble!
 </p>
 <p>
  The dragon’s body was pierced first, and the powerful bolt didn’t stop there; it also perforated the giant behind it.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Whoa, that’s intense!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -But why attack… they said they’d fight among themselves Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Weren’t you listening earlier? He wants to fight strong opponents.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Still, isn’t that overkill? lolololol
 </p>
 <p>
  [A.DaVVies has donated 100000 GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Player Seong Jihan..! You shouldn’t aim for the first place!! Please, for the sake of humanity, for the sake of Earth, restrain yourself until the next match!!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seems like they’re worried that if they eliminate those bug-level players, Seong Jihan will easily take first place.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once again, Coach Davies objects while making a donation to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Seong Jihan just smiles faintly and points his spear towards the battlefield.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry. Those guys aren’t as easy as you think.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The sky, previously cloven by the Crimson Thunder Cannon, would have easily wiped out the enemies under normal circumstances in its intense assault.
 </p>

 <p>
  However…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Whoa… Is this it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this the Hidden Boss’s final skill?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…As expected, he’s strong. There’s a reason why my boys couldn’t clear it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssssh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The Black Dragon quickly regenerated its body, and the giant dusted itself off, extinguishing the fires caused by the Crimson Thunder Cannon.
 </p>
 <p>
  The power of the Crimson Thunder Cannon was indeed mighty, But It was a power that these bug-level players could withstand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssssh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The eyes of the players formerly at odds with each other all turned towards Seong Jihan together.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems like the hidden boss won’t be taken down easily.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shouldn’t we try to capture him first?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We could cut off his limbs and put them on display, then take him as the final loot.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh. How can we trust you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The power of that ultimate move seems like something we can handle. It’s better to let the players fight it out here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Surrounded by Seong Jihan, who they considered to be rebellious, the players convened a discussion.
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering himself a trophy, Seong Jihan then pointed his spear at them.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ve got something wrong in your conversation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The ultimate move?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssssh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The void force circulated around Seong Jihan’s body. The crimson lightning at the tip of the spear became even more intense.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is just one of my regular moves.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  Now double in size, the Crimson Thunder Cannon struck the Black Dragon and the giant once more.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This force… I can’t endure it with just my body…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Absolute Barrier!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The giant hurriedly avoided the attack, and the Black Dragon used absolute defense magic.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, even the barrier spread out in seven layers was pierced by the Crimson Thunder Cannon
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  .
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  It tore apart the Black Dragon’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aaaargh…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Here goes another round…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Warp — let’s get out of here!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Phoenix Spear crackled with another surge of crimson lightning, the Black Dragon hastily evacuated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite being one of the strongest dragonkin players, he managed to endure another blast of the Crimson Thunder Cannon infused with the power of the void and escape.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile,
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Black Dragon fled from the second round of lightning,
 </p>
 <p>
  The players ceased their struggle.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Crimson Thunder as a regular move…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wasn’t the hidden boss supposed to rely on a one-hit kill trait boost to be strong?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This isn’t the time to fight among ourselves.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In battle, they were all seasoned warriors with strong bones.
 </p>
 <p>
  They quickly realized the danger of the Crimson Thunder and swiftly changed their stance.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s take him down first.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ominous glances gathered on Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  The battle waged by Seong Jihan against multiple opponents. Although it had only been about 10 minutes since the battle began, the sky and the earth had already been shattered numerous times.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow… Are these guys really players? Not gods?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -I’m Diamond rank, but I’m quitting the game… How do you fight those monsters?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -The Blue Blood Demons’ base is completely destroyed lololol…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Seriously, how can they withstand the chaos caused by those monsters in the sky?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Fr, even one meteor hit would wipe out the demons.
 </p>
 <p>
  Diamond-ranked players were considering quitting the game due to the overwhelming strength of the transcendent-level players. However, for the viewers, they were merely amazed by the scale displayed on the screen. The real astonishment was directed at the players relentlessly attacking Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This crazy guy…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So tenacious, so very tenacious!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How does he keep going?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wasn’t the hidden boss’s defense rated A…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “And vitality was rated F!”
 </p>
 <p>
  To most players from lower-tier races, humanity seemed insignificant compared to the giant entities dominating the battlefield. With their combined strength, it seemed like Seong Jihan, who would have been easily defeated, had become a formidable boss. Despite being constantly bombarded, he was holding his ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Haha…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Are you actually finding this funny, Master?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course. They’re strong, so it’s fun to fight.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Isn’t your body in shambles?]
 </p>
 <p>
  As Ariel had mentioned, Seong Jihan’s physical condition was far from normal. His body, usually untouched, was scorched and torn apart. Despite wounds regenerating, they reopened, and blood continued to flow incessantly. However, Seong Jihan seemed to enjoy his battered state.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now I understand.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Understand what?]
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  “How to use the life force stored in Eclipse.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Is this remarkable healing factor powered by the force of life?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite being constantly bombarded by the transcendent-level players’ assaults, Seong Jihan instinctively began to utilize the life force and find ways to use it. Although it would be great if he could awaken this power through enduring such attacks…
 </p>
 <p>
  [Nevertheless, isn’t it becoming increasingly difficult to endure?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. The life force has greatly diminished.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As pointed out by Ariel, Seong Jihan’s regeneration had reached its limit. The wounds had stopped healing, and the bleeding wouldn’t stop. To anyone watching, it seemed like Seong Jihan was nearing his end.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The hidden boss…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is he finally meeting his demise?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t let your guard down. Someone said that earlier and ended up dead.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s true.”
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the players surrounding Seong Jihan were cautious. Thinking they had all subdued him, they had lost 10 lives already. The neck of the Black Dragon, which had come back for another challenge, was severed, and the giant’s body was split in half. These players, who had reigned as mythical beings in their own worlds, now found themselves in a shameful situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s come to this; he must be caught.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A being like that has to drop diamonds… It has to!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As strong as they were, the other players bore great expectations for the reward to come from the Seong Jihan raid.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is this the end now…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -You’ve fought well, Seong Jihan, really.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Today, I’m convinced. Humanity just needs to ride the Seong Jihan bus blindly. That’s the conclusion, whether it’s today or not, lololol.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -To witness death like this… sob
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as viewers sensed the climax approaching,
 </p>
 <p>
  “These… creatures…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Wriggle! Wriggle!
 </p>
 <p>
  Giant tentacles stretching from the earth to the sky split apart.
 </p>
 <p>
  What appeared from within were massive teeth and blue eyes flashing within them.
 </p>
 <p>
  The tentacles shifted the teeth around, emitting a roar.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Why here of all times…! My grand design is ruined… I won’t forgive this!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Kaaah!
 </p>
 <p>
  A cry of rage echoed from the tentacles.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the players surrounding Seong Jihan indifferently watched this new development.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why is this weak thing causing a fuss?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm, the reward doesn’t seem worth it either.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ignore it. Let’s take down the hidden boss first.”
 </p>
 <p>
  To those who reigned as absolute beings in their own worlds, the tentacles were not threatening at all. As they turned their gaze back to Seong Jihan, the blue eye within the tentacle’s mouth emitted a brilliant light.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Possession!]
 </p>
 <p>
  And then…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh? What…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait, why isn’t possession working on me…!?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the players surrounding Seong Jihan , more than half hesitated.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kill them all…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Quick, log me out!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon after being possessed, they began fighting among themselves, now on the same side.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The effects of this possession seem… alright.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Blue Blood Demons’ possession had been entirely random until now. However, this time, the light emitted by the tentacle’s possession was showing quite effective results.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Martial Soul cannot be breached.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He crossed his arms leisurely, watching his opponents fall into disarray with a wistful eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Tsk. If only I were not immune to possession. What a pity.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master… Do you want to die that badly?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was considering understanding more about the life force… Huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, observing the enemy players fighting amongst themselves, furrowed his eyebrows.
 </p>
 <p>
  The life force.
 </p>
 <p>
  The power possessed by the Elves.
 </p>
 <p>
  He could sense it even from the eye within the tentacle.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s odd.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With a swift movement, Seong Jihan charged towards the tentacle’s mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Possession!]
 </p>
 <p>
  As he approached, the tentacle’s eye inside the mouth gleamed once again, but Seong Jihan confidently declared, “That won’t work on me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan quickly entered the mouth and tore out the shining blue eye that he could feel bursting with life force.
 </p>
 <p>
  [No, how could you… from such a distance…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The tentacle screamed in disbelief.
 </p>
 <p>
  But for Seong Jihan…
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s attention had already shifted elsewhere.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What is this…?’
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as he ripped open the eye, the orb transformed.
 </p>
 <p>
  From the iris, it morphed into a giant seed.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then…
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have obtained the ‘Modified Seed of Life.’]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have found the origin of the Blue Blood Demons.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A system message appeared for Seong Jihan, indicating that he had found the origin.

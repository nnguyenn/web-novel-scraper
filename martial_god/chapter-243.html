  Chapter 243
 </p>
 <p>
  “That old man took action himself. There definitely was an issue with this world.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Click! Click!
 </p>
 <p>
  The black skull rattled its teeth as the masked elf vanished into thin air. Observing the disappearance, the skull turned its head towards Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you alright, my leader?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who’s that guy?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The half-masked elf.
 </p>
 <p>
  He looked different from the stereotypical elves seen before. The elves human race had witnessed, though appearing in various forms, were actually all with the same female elf face, due to a disguise spell.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, the elf seen earlier seemed truly undisguised and distinctly male – different from any elf encountered before.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He didn’t have green hair like a High Elf but silver instead.’
 </p>
 <p>
  An odd creature indeed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing Seong Jihan’s curiosity, Karlein clicked its teeth and said,
 </p>
 <p>
  “That masked elf from before? An ancient elf.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ancient elf?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, an old elf. Supposedly a member of the elder council from the time the World Tree Alliance was formed… I’ve only seen him a few times with business, so I don’t know much. I just know that each of them is individually strong enough to be a constellation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “As strong as a constellation?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. And quite a powerful high-ranking one at that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Karlein glanced at the seed Seong Jihan was holding.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you give that to the BattleNet, he might really come after you. Why not just absorb it all?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm, worried?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course. You’re going to be my Leader, Those old elves are petty and dangerous. You don’t want to be targeted by them; it’ll be a hassle.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If Karlein was saying so, then the masked elf was definitely no easy adversary.
 </p>
 <p>
  But Seong Jihan decided,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll have to hand it over regardless.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. The misery of elves is my happiness.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Epic quest reward aside,
 </p>
 <p>
  If it caused trouble for the World Tree Alliance, Seong Jihan was willing to take the risk.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright then… If it gets dangerous, call me anytime. I’ll come to save you!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That won’t be necessary.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll keep the constellation channel open at all times! See you next time!”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a wave, the black skull disappeared, and the undead legion summoned to block the masked elf vanished along with it.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why is the skull so obsessed with Seong Jihan?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -It wants to make him its Leader; definitely no good intentions there.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -But why does the black skull want a Leader? What is it going to do with the Leader?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Exactly. But opening a constellation channel… Is that kid a constellation? LOL.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -All the fantasies about the constellation are shattered now -_-
 </p>
 <p>
  Karlein was drastically different from the typical image of a constellation, and viewers debated over this peculiarity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssssh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The vanished Karlein reappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah. I said goodbye, yet here I am, coming back like this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why did you return?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “For the first-place award ceremony, of course!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “First place?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. You’ve made the greatest contribution to annihilating the Blue Blood Demons across both factions.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The black skull chuckled ominously before widening its mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, from within, a massive diamond popped out.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The first-place reward… is this stat diamond that increases your remaining stats by ten points!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thanks for the reward, but why am I first place?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan tilted his head questioningly.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had been battling players from the Solar Faction right up until the game ended.
 </p>
 <p>
  What did that have to do with contributing to the annihilation?
 </p>
 <p>
  “According to BattleNet’s own evaluation scores, you’re overwhelmingly dominant. Probably because you completely trampled the hopes of the Blue Blood Demons?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, by preventing the possession, huh.”
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">

 </div>
 <p>
  “Yeah, possession switching! Since you blocked it at the source, your merit is much greater than just destroying the city below. Here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssssh…
 </p>
 <p>
  With a whoosh, the massive diamond flew towards Seong Jihan, who observed it quietly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is this the reward for annihilating an entire race…?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Ten remaining stats + 10. While it was a top-tier reward in the game, the complex emotions of having ended a race for it crossed his mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  If humanity were to face extinction, and players were to join the fray, would they slaughter humanity for a stat boost of +10?
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you doing? Aren’t you going to accept it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…No. I’ll accept what’s given.”
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s right.
 </p>
 <p>
  Comparing the current situation of the Blue Blood Demons with humanity was a meaningless speculation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan stopped pondering and gripped the diamond.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Essence of the Race’ has been absorbed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your remaining stats increase by +10.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Essence of the Race granted the boost and then vanished,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Farewell for real this time, Leader~”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whirl.
 </p>
 <p>
  The black skull spun in place and vanished.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘You have cleared the Special Map, ‘Race Annihilation Battle’ in the first place.’]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your level increases by 10.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You gain 10 billion GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Beyond the Essence of the Race,
 </p>
 <p>
  Substantial experience and GP rewards also came as first-place prizes.
 </p>
 <p>
  ’10 levels at once… Am I going to hit rank 1 now?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Each level up was a significant factor in the rankings, and a 10-level jump would cause a massive shift in rankings.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought he might achieve first place, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  [A.DaVVies has donated 100,000 GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Wow. Seong Jihan, 2nd place!! Congratulations!! You won’t have to worry about the next match!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing Coach Davies’ message, he realized he didn’t secure first place.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh… Seong Jihan got 2nd place?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Thankfully, he didn’t get 1st place LOL.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Phew… He won’t be targeted until the next Space League…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -But seriously, isn’t Oliver amazing? How does he keep holding onto 1st place while Seong Jihan keeps climbing?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Yeah, he’s holding up well LOL.
 </p>
 <p>
  Oliver, who had held the top spot in the world rankings for several years. It was already a given that Seong Jihan would take first place from him, but Oliver had managed to hold on as much as possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should reclaim 1st place after the next Space League.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking so, Seong Jihan logged out of the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh. Ah! Aaah… What’s this? My hair!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as he logged out, Ariel, who came out of Seong Jihan’s arm, screamed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I-I’ve turned into a High Elf!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The grayish-black hair of Ariel had turned green like a High Elf in some strands.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is it because of the life force?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… With this change, I am no longer a shadow elf…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Think of it as evolution.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What kind of evolution is this! It’s a mess!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Still, you seem stronger than last time?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “R-Really? Hmm…”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong-Jihan spoke, Ariel, who looked at him with trembling eyes, began to check her condition in earnest.
 </p>
 <p>
  She cast shadows around the house and split them into dozens or hundreds from one form.
 </p>
 <p>
  She nodded hesitantly to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…It’s true. I’ve become noticeably stronger.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right? So let’s keep at it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Sigh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Although she didn’t want to receive the life force, she couldn’t refuse the situation when the results were so clear. Ariel sighed deeply and returned to Seong Jihan’s arms.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Maybe I should rest for a bit…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Before that, do you know anything about that masked elf? Just share that and then you can rest.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Masked Elf? Was there such a being? I couldn’t see it earlier because I was too distracted by this life force.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Constellation of the dead star said he’s an ancient elf.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “An ancient elf…”
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  In response to Seong Jihan’s words, Ariel’s tone became serious all of a sudden.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you have any footage of the Masked Elf from earlier?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sure.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She rewound the recently ended BattleTube and sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh… A High Elf. I’ve only heard stories. Each member of the Council of the World Tree, who created the World Tree Alliance, is as powerful as a constellation. If this being reveals itself, it must be reported to the Queen immediately… Can I have a moment to report?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ancient elves from the World Tree Alliance… Anything else you know about them?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s all I know. I’ll ask the Queen for more information.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh, before we hear more about this ancient elf, wouldn’t it be better to leave the seed alone? If that being really comes into this world, it could be threatening.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll go report this now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Ariel disappeared to report to the Shadow Queen, Seong Jihan looked at the seed he held in his right hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Both Karlein and Ariel advised me to leave it alone.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He had grasped the extent of the ancient elf’s strength when he effortlessly disposed of the tentacle, but their displayed caution still seemed excessive.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What’s the big deal with this thing?’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan fiddled with the shrunken modified seed,
 </p>
 <p>
  A system message appeared before him.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Would you like to return the ‘Modified Seed of Life’ to BattleNet?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [If more life force is lost from the seed, it won’t be accepted as ‘evidence material,’ and no reward will be given.]
 </p>
 <p>
  BattleNet warned him not to absorb more life force from the seed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan sighed,
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking he would drain all the force and then return the seed, but now he had to put that on hold.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Maybe I’ll wait until I hear what the queen has to say.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Returning the seed was certain,
 </p>
 <p>
  But he might as well listen to the ancient elf story as Ariel suggested.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssssh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, green smoke began to waft from the modified seed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘The Modified Seed of Life’ is rapidly losing force.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [If the force is further depleted, it will not be accepted as ‘evidence material,’ and no reward can be given.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do you wish to return the ‘Modified Seed of Life’?]
 </p>
 <p>
  With a sense of urgency, the messages kept popping up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who hadn’t done anything, found both the seed and system in an inexplicable frenzy.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What’s going on with this thing?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Uncertain of the sudden changes,CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll return it now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Not wanting to miss out on the epic quest reward, Seong Jihan promptly handed over the modified seed of life to the system.
 </p>
 <p>
  As if waiting for his decision, the seed promptly vanished.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have cleared the Epic Quest.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Void stat limit increases by +30.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have obtained the title, ‘Void Enforcer’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The quest-clear message and rewards were granted.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Good. I didn’t have a suitable title to equip.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, eager to inspect his new title earned as an epic quest reward,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssssh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Noticed the green smoke that had billowed from the seed didn’t dissipate.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead, it intensified and flew outside through the window.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to deal with that first.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The life force-filled smoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  Left to its own devices, it could unknowably impact Earth and humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to sort out the smoke’s issue before checking out the title,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssssh…
 </p>
 <p>
  He reached out effortlessly to absorb it,
 </p>
 <p>
  But the smoke resisted and broke through the window, flying out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Observing the green mist move as freely as if the window wasn’t there,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That’s some serious resistance.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan stood up and opened the window, stepping outside.
 </p>
 <p>
  Stepping into thin air, he reached out for the smoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssssh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Transforming briefly into a tree-like form, the smoke then…
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssssh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Morphed into unique symbols.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What’s this…?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Seong Jihan had no prior knowledge of these symbols, he could somehow read them.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This world has already undergone the experiment.]

  Chapter 247
 </p>
 <p>
  With Seong Jihan joining the fray, everyone thought Taiwan’s second match would be an easy win. However, the gameplay turned out to be stunningly unexpected.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Hu Wootaek is flying in the sky!
 </p>
 <p>
  =What…what’s he doing up there?
 </p>
 <p>
  The colossal Taiji summoned by Hu Wootaek devoured the map when it spun one way.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Even the trains are flying away… Is this even possible?
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah, the Taiji is reversing!
 </p>
 <p>
  =The screen is… suddenly engulfed in darkness.
 </p>
 <p>
  When it spun the other way, a white sword spewing darkness dyed the world completely black.
 </p>
 <p>
  An overwhelming dark force that no player could resist.
 </p>
 <p>
  -What’s that…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Why can’t we see the screen? Is there an error??
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -I hope it’s an error… I can’t believe Jihan has been defeated T_T
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -No, that old man has never used this before!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -If it’s to this extent, isn’t he the strongest player in humanity?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Yeah, why didn’t he compete in the Space League?…
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers who anticipated a one-sided match were panicked when the elderly player from Taiwan ended the game in a short time. However…
 </p>
 <p>
  =Uh… What? The game result. Korea wins?
 </p>
 <p>
  The actual outcome of the game went against expectations once again.
 </p>
 <p>
  =What’s going on? How did this happen?
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah… The sole survivor is player Seong Jihan. Hu Wootaek is listed as having perished?
 </p>
 <p>
  When the Taiji reversed and the world plunged into darkness, everyone assumed the game had ended. But the game’s result was a victory for Korea.
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzing!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Gosh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why is that old man using such power here when he didn’t participate in the space league?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As players emerged from the battle net connector with dazed expressions…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh? We won? What, Uncle… What happened earlier?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah too stepped out of the connector with a similar look, startled by the game’s outcome, she turned to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  But he…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just a moment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, okay.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a serious expression, he reflected on the recent situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ve never faced such a formidable opponent before…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Since obtaining the Martial Soul and the Void, Seong Jihan hadn’t encountered any threats even in space. The most challenging adversary he faced recently was the self-destruction of Artemus.
 </p>
 <p>
  His power far surpassed normal standards. However..’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Taiji Sword… it was my utter defeat.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The white longsword from the inverse Taiji spewed such darkness as to eerily resemble the obliteration of his previous life.
 </p>
 <p>
  Neither the ability of the Martial soul to command space nor the power of the void could withstood that darkness.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan naturally thought he had perished, too.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Just as I was about to dissipate, I was able to grasp a clue to the fifth annihilation technique, Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The fifth annihilation technique, Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit, touched upon the wood attribute. No matter how much he trained, he couldn’t grasp its mechanism.
 </p>
 <p>
  His body shattered by the Taiji Sword, Seong Jihan found the thread of Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit as life force attempted to mend the disruption.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There seems to be a connection between the life force held by the elves and Gilgamesh’s authority…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recalled what the Ancient Elf had said.
 </p>
 <p>
  He, who had once rampaged, claiming to invade Earth, now pondered…
 </p>
 <p>
  “This planet… it was already a world where experiments were conducted… But the races here are too weak to be part of it…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Since Earth was a “world which has already undergone experiment,” he couldn’t enter the portal.
 </p>
 <p>
  Could this power of Gilgamesh be related to that?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s only a small clue for now, but…’
 </p>
 <p>
  With just a small hint about the Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit, Seong Jihan was able to regenerate his body through the power of life force.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though the mechanism was similar to his regeneration during Artemus’s self-destruction, this time, he regenerated his body from complete annihilation, reaching a higher level.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, since this regeneration wasn’t complete,
 </p>
 <p>
  Had the darkness of the Taiji Sword persisted, the newly revived body would have been erased promptly.

 <p>
  ‘Hu Wootaek’s body couldn’t withstand the power of the Taiji Sword.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite Dongbang sak’s possession, the Taiji Sword was too powerful for normal players to handle.
 </p>
 <p>
  When the Taiji Sword unleashed darkness, Hu Wootaek’s body naturally couldn’t endure it.
 </p>
 <p>
  If Seong Jihan hadn’t regenerated, he would have perished later, albeit not immediately.
 </p>
 <p>
  However…
 </p>
 <p>
  Because of him reviving, the game’s outcome was flipped in Korea’s favor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps because of that,
 </p>
 <p>
  A system message from Pythia popped up.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dongbang Sak says, ‘You survived the Taiji Sword and revived, junior. I accept my defeat.’ I’ve lost this bet. Disappointed, but I shall give you a free prophecy.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak gracefully acknowledged his loss in the battle however, Seong Jihan had no intention of accepting it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not his loss. Hu Wootaek’s body simply couldn’t handle it. Tell him I can’t accept victory, so let’s fight properly in another form.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [No. What are you saying? Dongbang Sak acknowledged his defeat, and I’m offering a free prophecy!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Skip the prophecy. I want to fight again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Oh… really? But my prophecy is very valuable!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Forget it; I don’t need it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan sought to fight once more rather than claim victory in the bet.
 </p>
 <p>
  As his entire being disintegrated and found the thread to Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Taiji and inverse Taiji unfolded by Dongbang Sak proved to be immense opportunities for learning.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In less than a year after acquiring the Martial soul, Seong Jihan became the most powerful player among humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Till now, there was not a single player worthy to learn from.
 </p>
 <p>
  With no one to emulate, he had to carve his own path and push his martial boundaries.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But his Taiji was different.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Taiji Sword technique exhibited by Dongbang Sak made a profound impression on Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even with the martial soul, he couldn’t comprehend its depth.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, witnessing the Taiji stimulated his subconscious, prompting new thoughts on the martial arts he had honed until now.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can’t pass up the opportunity to learn over some small prophecy.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if it meant facing defeat hundreds of times,
 </p>
 <p>
  For the exaltation of the martial soul, Seong Jihan was willing to embrace death readily.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Tell him I want another match. Quickly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […Are you serious about this? For real? Aren’t you curious about your future?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’d rather see or learn more about the Taiji.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Humph. I’ve never been disrespected in such a way before… Fine. Just a moment.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Once Seong Jihan firmly expressed his will, Pythia sent another message after a pause.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You can fight in the next match. What do you say?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Then, just ensure you’re not banned. If you are in game three, you can’t contend after that.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded to her words and promptly went to Coach Noh Youngjun.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha. Hu Wootaek… was he this powerful all along? Why did he conceal his strength until now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We could simply ban him from now on, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “With no other remarkable key player in Taiwan, we should just ban him and be safe.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Though Korea won the second match, the coaching staff suggested they include Hu Wootaek in the ban list for safety, as he demonstrated extraordinary power.
 </p>
 <p>
  Coach Noh Youngjun was also nodding, about to agree to this proposal when…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t ban Hu Wootaek, please.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ji…Jihan?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just leave him be for the third game. After that, you can do as you wish.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pondering Seong Jihan’s words, Coach Noh fell deep in thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  To the coach, the right move would indeed be to ban Hu Wootaek.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Looks like Jihan wants to confront him again…’
 </p>
 <p>
  That was the issue with it being Seong Jihan’s request.
 </p>
 <p>
  The hero who single-handedly dragged the Korean team up from last place in the regional league to contenders for the Champions League.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was hard for even a coach to disregard the wish of such a transcendent player.
 </p>
 <p>
  “After the third game… are you really sure it doesn’t matter?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, I’m sure.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright, then Hu Wootaek won’t be banned this game.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The coaching staff exchanged unsure glances, but none contradicted.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were well aware of Seong Jihan’s stature within the Korean team.
 </p>
 <p>
  Who were they to say he was wrong for not banning Hu Wootaek and risking defeat?
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘We won the second game, so…’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘You never know, right?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Anyway, since Korea had won the second game,
 </p>
 <p>
  Maybe it was okay to give Hu Wootaek a pass for one match; they could just ban him in the 4th and 5th game.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the coaching staff’s consent, Coach Noh began selecting the ban for the third game.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah… Hu Wootaek has not been banned!
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  =Even after watching game two, they are leaving Hu Wootaek unbound…
 </p>
 <p>
  =What exactly is Coach Noh thinking!
 </p>
 <p>
  =The Taiwanese coach isn’t banning Seong Jihan either!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Instead, Yoon Sejin is banned!
 </p>
 <p>
  =The map is just Bridge Alone…
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah. In that case… won’t it just be the same result as game two?
 </p>
 <p>
  Nothing changed but the map.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the same lineup as the second game, Korea and Taiwan were set to clash again.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Bridge Alone.
 </p>
 <p>
  Typically a defense map in BattleNet to fend off undead armies, in the national representation matches it turned into an invasion map where both camps clashed across a bridge.
 </p>
 <p>
  Originally, the game progressed with warriors forming formations and advancing on the large bridge, supported by archers and mages from behind. However, the third match against Taiwan took on a completely different aspect.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Being willing to forsake prophecy to fight with me again, that’s a big decision.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thunk! Thunk!
 </p>
 <p>
  From the Taiwanese camp walked Hu Wootaek, leisurely approached alone.
 </p>
 <p>
  With each step, his appearance changed subtly.
 </p>
 <p>
  His beard grew longer, his hair became whiter.
 </p>
 <p>
  Originally a middle-aged appearance, he was now completely transformed into an elderly man with lush white hair.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That is correct.”
 </p>
 <p>
  And from the Korean camp, the sole player walking forward was none other than Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was fully equipped, drawing two weapons at the ready.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alas, this time I can’t unleash the Taiji.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why not?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This player can’t withstand it anymore. It might kill him.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s unfortunate.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The power that erased the map, the Taiji’s force.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite his eagerness to experience it once more, it seemed he couldn’t because the incarnated body was too weak.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan felt a tinge of disappointment, but Dongbang Sak stroked his beard.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Worry not. The original bet was for a minute, was it not?”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a yank, Dongbang Sak pulled a hair from his beard.
 </p>
 <p>
  Suuuu…
 </p>
 <p>
  An intense demonic aura arose behind him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can end this using the Heavenly Demon’s power alone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  With just a single hand movement,
 </p>
 <p>
  The atmosphere stirred violently, and Seong Jihan’s left arm disappeared in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  The formless palm of the Heavenly Demon.
 </p>
 <p>
  The strike that transcended shape erased not only the arm but also the shadow sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm…”
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Dongbang Sak appeared unsatisfied after erasing Seong Jihan’s arm, emitting a low chortle.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Heavenly Demon’s power seems insufficient.”
 </p>
 <p>
  But for a good reason.
 </p>
 <p>
  Suuuu…
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s vanished left arm was rematerialized.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s only the beginning.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, show me properly. A minute goes by quickly after all”
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  Before Seong Jihan could finish,
 </p>
 <p>
  The bridge collapsed, and Dongbang Sak’s body rapidly closed in on Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right. This will end quickly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In the blink of an eye, with intense demonic energy surging forth, Seong Jihan smiled amid the pain of his torn body.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the Taiji Sword was ungraspable,
 </p>
 <p>
  He instinctively comprehended the martial art of the Heavenly Demon Palm.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this how you use the Formless Palm?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swooooosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Having recuperated, Seong Jihan mimicked the Formless Palm he had just seen.
 </p>
 <p>
  A shred of Dongbang Sak’s robe was torn.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak looked sternly at his disappearing clothing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s replication of the Formless Palm.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having observed it only once, the similarity was strikingly profound.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Did you comprehend this with your martial soul?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you become my successor, never imitate it again,” Dongbang sak warned, his demonic energy growing ominously.

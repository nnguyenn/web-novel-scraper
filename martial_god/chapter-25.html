  Chapter 25

 </p>
 <p>
  The building next to Sword Palace, the Korean branch office of a Japanese trading company.
 </p>
 <p>
  This office, usually tightly closed with iron doors, was actually used as the Korean branch of the Neo Self-Defence Force.
 </p>
 <p>
  The reason the Neo Self-Defence’ branch was established next to Sword Palace was simple: to recruit Sword King Yoon Sejin.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, the office that had become useless by now was transformed into the personal space of the head recruiter, Takeda Kazuo.
 </p>
 <p>
  A large desk with eight neatly arranged monitors. Takeda swiftly devoured the stack of hamburgers on it, watching Seong Jihan’s achievements with an annoyed expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Sang. If you’re already showing such prowess… you might receive offers from other countries, not just Korea.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The sight of Seong Jihan single-handedly sweeping away zombies. Even though he was just a Bronze player, the scene showcased that his future value was different from that of ordinary players.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although he hadn’t been active in the league for long and hadn’t gained much attention, if such absurd scenes continued to be staged, it was clear that the surroundings would become noisy before he even got to Silver.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Before that happens, I need to secure Seong Sang somehow…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Takeda furrowed his brow.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it was just about money, Neo Self-Defence’ side wouldn’t have been left behind. However, Seong Jihan wasn’t the type that could be recruited with just money.
 </p>
 <p>
  To transfer him to Japan, “special” means were necessary.
 </p>
 <p>
  And for that to happen…
 </p>
 <p>
  “The approval of the upper echelons is required.”
 </p>
 <p>
  However, even with Takeda’s appeal, the conservative upper echelons of the Neo Self-Defence Force hadn’t granted their approval.
 </p>
 <p>
  There needed to be solid grounds to convince them.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That would be the Status Window.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If the data from the Status Window, which undoubtedly had remarkable information due to Seong Jihan’s displayed martial arts, was added, it might be possible to persuade the upper echelons of the Neo Self-Defence Force.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gulp! Gulp!…
 </p>
 <p>
  Takeda drank cola through a straw and calmly began to formulate a plan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes… Surely, Bronze’s Defense Map was about protecting the Crystal.”
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  In the center of the tower floats a crystal.
 </p>
 <p>
  Protecting it was the top priority of the defense map.
 </p>
 <p>
  And this also meant that it was possible for team members to destroy it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Tap-tap-tap!
 </p>
 <p>
  Takeda let go of the food in his hand and quickly began typing on the keyboard.
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the eight monitors focused on someone other than Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Sword King Fc 898’ entered the channel of the magician Kim Gyuhyuk]
 </p>
 <p>
  Takeda’s alternate account.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Kim Gyuhyuk! I can’t stand seeing that Seong Jihan guy outshine you like this!
 </p>
 <p>
  Takeda started his maneuvering.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha. This guy’s insane… So damn strong.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Gyuhyuk watched Seong Jihan, who was annihilating enemies alone, and his mouth twitched. They were clearly in the same Bronze League, but what on earth is this difference?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stupid game, the balance is crap…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Gyuhyuk muttered while shifting his gaze. He didn’t want to see the despicable human’s impressive performance any longer.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kyuuhhh~ It’s beautiful… so beautiful!”
 </p>
 <p>
  He glanced at Streamer Golden light, who had both hands clasped together as if in prayer, with an expression of disgust. Then, Kim Gyuhyuk turned his back to the front of the tower and walked slowly towards the crystal.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh… when will this end?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Not too long ago, he merely disliked looking at Seong Jihan. He had no other thoughts.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Sword King Fc 898 has donated 100GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Kim Gyuhyuk! Please accept our Sword King’s Fc Quest!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, messages of donations started appearing on his channel, which only had about 10 viewers and had been left open just as a formality.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Sword King 898 Fc has sent you a viewer Quest.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Break the crystal and prevent Seong Jihan from being in 1st place.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Reward: GP 50,000
 </p>
 <p>
  A quest with 50K GP as a reward appeared, and Kim Gyuhyuk stopped moving.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…50,000?”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘50,000 GP is equivalent to 50 million Korean won. He will get that much money just to break a single crystal?’
 </p>
 <p>
  That wasn’t all.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Is this where you marked the coordinates, 898?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wow~ As expected of 898. Your dedication is amazing.
 </p>
 <p>
  – We can’t just let that Seong Jihan guy rampage like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  – I’ll also donate to this Quest!
 </p>
 <p>
  On his channel, which was almost in complete darkness and had hardly any activity, Sword King’s Fc messages started flooding in.
 </p>
 <p>
  The GP for completing the quest began increasing little by little.
 </p>
 <p>
  52,000, 53,000…
 </p>
 <p>
  When it reached 55,000, Kim Gyuhyuk’s eyes shook uncontrollably.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘These Sword King guys were crazy to begin with, but… this is something else…’
 </p>
 <p>
  [Sword King Fc 898 has donated 300GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Kim Gyuhyuk! Please act quickly! If another tower falls, Seong Jihan will automatically achieve 1st place!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Encouraged by Sword King Fc 898, Kim Gyuhyuk grinned maliciously.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seems like he really hates JiHan.’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Even if I end up in last place, I won’t lose any skills…’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Of course, I have to accept it! When I remember how I lost a skill because of him…’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That’s right. I’ll make up for the loss with this GP!’
 </p>
 <p>
  55,000 GP was a sufficient amount to distort past memories. Kim Gyuhyuk’s mind had gone wild, and he immediately took action.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Sword King luv124 has donated 100GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Before breaking the crystal, please curse Seong Jihan thoroughly. I can’t stand that arrogant bastard anymore.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Gyuhyuk looked at Seong Jihan, who was far away, and nodded his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  What can he do to me from over there?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kukukukuk.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When he was first summoned, Kim Gyuhyuk felt anxious when he saw Seong Jihan. That feeling was nowhere to be found now.
 </p>
 <p>
  With excitement, Kim Gyuhyuk approached the crystal. And when the crystal came within the range of his magic.
 </p>
 <p>
  He turned on the voice chat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan, you son of a bitch.”
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Hearing sudden curses, Seong Jihan was more bewildered than angry.
 </p>
 <p>
  Troller Kim Gyuhyuk.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just a while ago, he was behaving properly, and now he’s doing this?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He is creating trouble just when I’m about to achieve 1,000 kills.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan has achieved 920 kills so far. He was about to see the next quest, an important moment. Why act like this now?
 </p>
 <p>
  As the game was nearing its end, was he trying to take revenge for the last time?
 </p>
 <p>
  “For now, let’s ignore him.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He could easily achieve 80 kills, so there was no need to pay attention to such insults.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was about to turn off the voice chat to focus on killing zombies, Kim Gyuhyuk’s curses rained down like a barrage.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You think it’s okay to scam your high school niece? Her father probably abandoned her because she was fooling around with you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Starting from this, Kim Gyuhyuk began intertwining Yoon Seah and Seong Jihan while showering them with curses.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether he had already predicted that Seong Jihan was about to mute the chat or not.
 </p>
 <p>
  [He went to Japan because of the shock of you two fooling around, right? You dirty bastards~ Haha.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Gyuhyuk poured out curses almost as if he was rapping.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan turned off the voice chat, no more curses came out. But he suddenly found himself standing still.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om
 </p>
 <p>
  “….”
 </p>
 <p>
  It was fine for others to curse him. After all, he was used to it, having heard countless insults even in his past life. He had long learned how to ignore criticism.
 </p>
 <p>
  However…

  Bothering his niece was an entirely different story, especially the way Gyuhyuk was saying such dirty things about her and him.

  Chapter 250
 </p>
 <p>
  “No… not the buzz cuts again. Can it really be the 108 Arhat Formation?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah looked at the game screen, her face a mix of astonishment and dread.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before Wang Lin had emerged in China as the top warrior, the notorious Shinsong Il-ryong had reigned using the 108 Arhat Formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  That very same formation that once gave Seong Jihan a hard time and was ultimately deciphered and defused by him, now looked to be making a comeback.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Dad’s going to smash through it, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hard to say. I would have been sure had Wang Lin not been involved…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Wang Lin, known by his title ‘Heavenly Demon,’ seemed an unlikely fit for Shaolin’s 108 Arhat Formation, it appeared that in-game buffs applied all the same, regardless of whether the user was a ‘Heavenly Demon’ or ‘Heavenly God’.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The first game might prove to be difficult.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Now overshadowed by the real Heavenly Demon Dongbang Sak, Wang Lin’s once shining moniker had dimmed.
 </p>
 <p>
  However his SSS-class gift, the ‘Heavenly Demon Body’ remained a talent not outclassed even by the Sword King’s ‘Twin Sword Mastery.’
 </p>
 <p>
  For now, Wang Lin was weaker due to being a lower level, but with further growth, he held the potential to fiercely battle the Sword King.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the 108 Arhat Formation could be the equalizer he needed to bridge their current gap.
 </p>
 <p>
  =The first game is about to begin.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah… Il-ryong has immediately activated the 108 Arhat Formation!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Different from the last match, this time Wang Lin has joined the formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  [108 Arhat Formation shall test Yoon Sejin.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As Il-ryong chanted from the front of the Chinese ranks, a flash of light!
 </p>
 <p>
  18 Chinese warriors, together with the Sword King, vanished from the battlefield.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not 9, but 18 players used the formation this time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then the warrior count left on the field… isn’t it pretty close now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Very close.”
 </p>
 <p>
  True to Yoon Seah’s words,
 </p>
 <p>
  now only 49 Korean and 32 Chinese warriors remained in Valhalla.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Korean warriors… must capitalize on their numerical advantage, with Sword King gone!
 </p>
 <p>
  =But the remaining Chinese players are high-end too. Their average levels are 10-20 higher.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Still, we have 1.5 times their number! The level gap is manageable!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the commentators noted, Korea did have the 1.5 times numerical advantage, but Korean commentators weren’t sounding hopeful.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Korean warrior force was deemed the world’s strongest precisely because of Seong Jihan and Yoon Sejin.
 </p>
 <p>
  Remove those two, and it became painfully clear that Korea’s warriors were the weakest in the Northeast Asia League.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh, this is annoying…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Our national warriors, are they earning their keep?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Remember last year? Even Taiwan trashed us, didn’t they?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -That unpleasant memory… not again.
 </p>
 <p>
  And that uneasy premonition quickly became reality.
 </p>
 <p>
  =The Korean warriors charged valiantly but…
 </p>
 <p>
  =The Chinese defense is impenetrable! They can’t break through!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah! We can see Korean casualties…
 </p>
 <p>
  =The Chinese warriors are now turning to offense!
 </p>
 <p>
  Starting off with a 1.5 times numerical advantage, the Korean warriors attempted to hammer the Chinese defenses.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the difference in level and skills of the two countries’ warriors was stark.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Feels like last year’s PTSD is coming back.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -How are things in the 108 Arhat Formation?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Sword King is going strong… but no easy suppression.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -It’s true, with Wang Lin’s intervention, the formation is holding firm…
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the pressure from the 108 Arhat Formation, the Sword King fought back indomitably.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the fortified Chinese formation, bolstered by Wang Lin, held fast.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Had he been at his past life’s level, he would have been suppressed already.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether it was the advice to focus on the Limited swords from White Sword that made a difference,
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin, firmly stronger than when he was in Japan, was weaving masterfully through the Shaolin monks, facing them head-on in battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  Neither side in the Arhat Formation gained the upper hand,
 </p>
 <p>
  suggesting the battle would continue till the end this way.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, the outcome of the match hinged not on the Arhat Formation but on the situation outside it…
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah…! Numbers are reversed! Now there are more Chinese warriors alive!
 </p>
 <p>
  =We started with a 1.5 times advantage, how could this happen!
 </p>
 <p>
  =With how fiercely Yoon Sejin is fighting…! This can’t be happening. Korean warriors, snap out of it!
 </p>
 <p>
  Against the shoutcasters’ outcry,
 </p>
 <p>
  One by one, Korean warriors started to fall.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, this isn’t right…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah couldn’t finish her sentence in frustration,
 </p>
 <p>
  Her face was painted with disbelief as she watched the Korean warriors perish.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why are we falling behind? Uncle, does a 10-20 level difference make that much impact?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s more than levels; there’s a significant gap in equipment.”
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  “Equipment gap…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. The Chinese warriors’ gear looks state-sponsored.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike the Korean national team, where players have to procure their own gear,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Chinese national team was equipped by the People’s Association with SS-grade equipment for national matches.
 </p>
 <p>
  Such a feat was possible because capital was monopolized by the country’s top guild, the People’s Association.
 </p>
 <p>
  The inability to capitalize on the numerical advantage was clearly affected by the disparity in gear.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now that you mention it, their armor does shine. That’s…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Still, the lack of skill is the biggest issue.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thump!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the fierce battle of Valhalla concluded, Korea’s last warrior fell.
 </p>
 <p>
  12 Chinese warriors survived.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking at the Korean team overwhelmed despite their numerical advantage, the viewers were filled with regret.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow, losing on this map…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Thanks for the vivid memory, Chinese Warriors
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -What are the odds Sword King obliterates the 108 Arhat Formation…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -It looks like they will just drag this on forever
 </p>
 <p>
  Korea’s sole survivor, Yoon Sejin, persisted in the fight within the Arhat Formation but,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The first game concludes as it goes beyond the allotted time.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The battle of Valhalla map went over time, and the first game ended in China’s victory.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha. We lost.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You did what you could, brother-in-law.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s my lack of ability. Had Jihan been there, he would have crushed them…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Exiting game one, Yoon Sejin sighed deeply.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the game on a warrior map, the victory should have been guaranteed.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the 108 Arhat Formation, now featuring Wang Lin, proved far too formidable.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Coach, I think we need to ban Il-ryong next match.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. It’s my fault. The game fell apart without Sejin…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Coach Noh Youngjun also blamed himself after witnessing the first game’s outcome.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s only thanks to those three that we’ve been considered championship contenders. Korea’s national team isn’t strong on its own.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, Yoon Sejin, and recently added Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  Their powers balanced or even overwhelmed other world teams, but excluding these key players, the rest were still lacking.
 </p>
 <p>
  Apart from the archers, the Korean team was lacking in nearly all areas.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first game was a harsh reflection of that bitter reality.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If we lose either match two or three… it’s definitely over.’
 </p>
 <p>
  China was sure to pick Golem Duel for game four.
 </p>
 <p>
  Should they lose either of the next two games, it’s over for Korea.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘We should have banned Il-ryong in the first game…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Regretting his past selections, Coach Noh Youngjun re-entered the ban and select phase, rethinking his strategy.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah! Coach Noh Youngjun bans Il-ryong!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Il-ryong, with the Monk Leader gift. Without him, the 108 Arhat Formation won’t activate!
 </p>
 <p>
  =That’ll free up Yoon Sejin to move around as he pleases!
 </p>
 <p>
  =And for the select card… it’s Valhalla again, just like the first game!
 </p>
 <p>
  =I wonder if that map will come up again?
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to the first game, the only change was Korea’s ban card.
 </p>
 <p>
  But that single change could be significant this time around.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Oh…
 </p>
 <p>
  =The Valhalla map is chosen again!
 </p>
 <p>
  =That 70 percent probability hits twice in a row!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good… Time for revenge for the first game.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin, having stared intently at which map would be picked, smiled as he entered the BattleNet connector.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle, I might not even get to play a single game today.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That goes for me too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, carrying a drink, finished her game-watching prep as the second game started.
 </p>
 <p>
  The flow of the match was completely different from game one.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Yoon Sejin charges alone swiftly!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Wang Lin tries to block him, but without the 108 Arhat Formation, he’s hopelessly overpowered!
 </p>
 <p>
  =No one can stand before the twin swords! The Sword King! He’s motivated from the first game’s defeat!
 </p>
 <p>
  =And swiftly, the game comes to an end!
 </p>
 <p>
  Without the 108 Arhat Formation to constrain Yoon Sejin, the Chinese team quickly crumbles.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Wang Lin is still lacking in growth, and couldn’t dodge the swords.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Schwing!
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching Wang Lin beheaded by the twin swords, Seong Jihan affirmed his previous thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Phew, LOL that’s more like it. This is how you win!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Banning the Monk Leader was the right move. That brat called ‘Heavenly Demon’ is not ready yet. LOL
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Heavenly Demon? More like an underling in the Evil Sect, LOL.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Seeing this makes the first game even more regrettable…
 </p>

 </div>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Right. We must win the third to push for a fifth game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Relieved by the smooth completion of the second game, the Korean fans relaxed a little.
 </p>
 <p>
  But considering the expected definite loss in the fourth game, the significance of the third game grew even more critical.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Now, from the third game onwards… Seong Jihan can also participate!
 </p>
 <p>
  =That’s right, although only a 50 percent chance!
 </p>
 <p>
  Starting from the third game, a player banned could be released with a 50 percent chance.
 </p>
 <p>
  The commentators, as well as,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan, please come with us. You have to prepare since you won’t be banned!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ha Yeonjoo and the team players all hoped that Seong Jihan’s ban would be lifted.
 </p>
 <p>
  With him, the third game was as good as won.
 </p>
 <p>
  But then,
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah… Seong Jihan is banned again…
 </p>
 <p>
  =He got caught in the 50 percent probability.
 </p>
 <p>
  =If only Seong Jihan had been picked, a sure victory would have been confirmed, but it’s a shame.
 </p>
 <p>
  The third game did not start on a good note.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘At this rate, I won’t even get to play before the game ends.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Banned again, Seong Jihan stepped out of the BattleNet connector, frowning deeply as he looked at the screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Being too strong does have its issues.
 </p>
 <p>
  I want to compete in the national match, but I can’t even get the chance.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Coach Noh Youngjun sticks to the same strategy as in the second game. He bans Il-ryong, and the map is Valhalla.
 </p>
 <p>
  =If Valhalla is chosen, we’ll have the same result as the second game. Then we can take it to a fifth game!Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  =The select card has become crucial now!
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite Seong Jihan being banned, If it’s a warrior map, Korea can easily claim victory in the third game, much like the second.
 </p>
 <p>
  Korean fans hoped again for Valhalla to be selected, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah…
 </p>
 <p>
  =This time, the map isn’t Valhalla!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Yeah, it’s the Train map!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Hmm… With Je Galheon still around, that’s quite annoying…
 </p>
 <p>
  Three consecutive 70 percent probabilities didn’t happen.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh no, we seem to be out of luck today.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -When did BattleNet turn into a game of luck?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Of all the maps that could’ve been picked, it had to be the Train map, with Je Galheon and Joo Ryung-Ryung unscathed…
 </p>
 <p>
  -But isn’t it still okay if the Sword King flies across the map with his sword?
 </p>
 <p>
  While people held onto hope for Yoon Sejin’s sword flight technique,
 </p>
 <p>
  =Joo Ryung-Ryung’s summon, the Yellow Dragon, stubbornly blocks Yoon Sejin’s path…!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Meanwhile, our train is getting decimated by Je Galheon’s magic!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Yoon Seah tries to take aim at Je Galheon, but the distance is too far and not feasible!
 </p>
 <p>
  Je Galheon utilized his grand sorcery, proving why he was banned in game one,
 </p>
 <p>
  =The train is derailing…
 </p>
 <p>
  =In the third game, Korea suffers a defeat…
 </p>
 <p>
  The third game ended in defeat for Korea.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… lost again…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Exiting the BattleNet connector, Yoon Seah sighed deeply.
 </p>
 <p>
  China, competing alongside the US for world supremacy, demonstrated their strength in the third game.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Yellow Dragon has become more troublesome.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin, blocked in his sword flight by the summon, shook his head as he stepped out from the connector.
 </p>
 <p>
  All three games he played with all his might, but the unsatisfactory 1-2 outcome left his expression dark.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That means game four is automatically the Golem Duel… Even if we ban Joo Ryung-Ryung, we’ll still be outmatched, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Looks like it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With only supporters allowed in Golem Duel,
 </p>
 <p>
  Korea’s supporter strength was clearly inferior to China’s.
 </p>
 <p>
  The outcome of this match was predictable by everyone.
 </p>
 <p>
  =China pulls out their reserve select card for the Golem Duel map.
 </p>
 <p>
  =And they use their ban card on supporter Lee Jinwook!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Coach Noh Youngjun too bans China’s supporter Joo Ryung-Ryung, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  =Without Joo Ryung-Ryung, China’s support lineup is still top-notch…
 </p>
 <p>
  The commentators predicted defeat, their voices sapped of hope.
 </p>
 <p>
  Similarly, Yoon Seah drooped her shoulders, watching when suddenly,
 </p>
 <p>
  She rose abruptly, watching Seong Jihan walk off somewhere with curious eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Un…uncle, where are you going?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “To participate in game four.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But… It’s a supporters’ game. Only buffs apply.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re set to lose with the current lineup, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s true…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If we’re destined to lose, it’s worth a shot to try something. I’ve already discussed it with the coach.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Without elaborating, Seong Jihan entered the BattleNet connector,
 </p>
 <p>
  Leaving Yoon Seah blinking at his retreating figure
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What kind of experiment?”
 </p>

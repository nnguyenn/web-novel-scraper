  Chapter 251
 </p>
 <p>
  “We won.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well done, everyone!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Chinese coach, receiving congratulations from his coaching staff, smiled broadly.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were moving into the fourth game, ‘Golem Duel,’ with a lead of two wins to one loss.
 </p>
 <p>
  Victory now seemed almost assured.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The third game was the real close-call. We were lucky.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Had the Valhalla map been chosen or had Seong Jihan been released from his ban, they could have lost the third game.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was only through fortunate happenstance that neither factor favored the Korean team, allowing China to gain the advantage.
 </p>
 <p>
  Had just one element fallen out of favor, the series might well have been a loss.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Chinese coach pondered, ‘Before Korea rises any further, we must secure the Champions League title this year.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With the advent of Seong Jihan, the Korean national team was rapidly advancing in power.
 </p>
 <p>
  The coach saw not only Seong Jihan as a threat but also the guild he’d established, Daegi Guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Right now, we’re welcoming players from all over, but preference goes to our own. If another Korean talent emerges, they’ll push hard for them.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If a player of the caliber of Yoon Sejin or Yoon Seah were to be added to the Korean team,
 </p>
 <p>
  China would not be able to claim superiority in the regional leagues.
 </p>
 <p>
  Today’s game was a victory by luck – had the map been different, the outcome could easily have been reversed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This year the first place will be ours.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Chinese coach, arms folded, watched the game screen as giant steel golems, ten on each end, stood side by side.
 </p>
 <p>
  Korean golems at the eastern end, Chinese golems at the western.
 </p>
 <p>
  The supporting players participating in the match were not visible from the stage.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were in a separate area called ‘Golem Control Room,’ where they supported their respective team’s golems with buffs.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Indeed, our golems are larger.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s because Korea’s supporters are subpar. The result is obvious.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The difference between the Chinese and Korean golems was unmissable – the Chinese were about 1.5 to 2 times larger.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was like an adult facing a child, with the golem size determined by the quality of buffs granted by the supporters.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are Korea’s supporters that inadequate? The difference in size is more than I expected.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The impact of banning Lee Jinwook is significant. He’s vital to Korea’s support.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Haha… looks like we’ve determined the outcome of this match already.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the size disparity confirmed the Chinese coach’s confidence in victory.
 </p>
 <p>
  “All ready for the victory interview then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, the reporters are standing by.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The coach, basking in the fun and about to shift his focus to the interview, was interrupted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What… what?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Coach, look at the screen!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “One of the Korean golems… it’s acting strange!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The coaching staff, noticing something awry on the screen, furrowed their brows.
 </p>
 <p>
  What could possibly be wrong now?
 </p>
 <p>
  Turning his head, the coach’s eyes widened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is that plant golem…”
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the steel golems, sprouting stems and leaves,
 </p>
 <p>
  Thumped! Thumped!
 </p>
 <p>
  As it hurtled forward, the surprising sight gripped everyone who saw it.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  -We actually lost…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -That third game defeat was too significant
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -So the 70 percent for Valhalla didn’t hit, but the 50 percent ban on Seong Jihan did???? What’s going on with these odds, really?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Look at that, the Chinese coach shrewdly bans Lee Jinwook.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Like they’d lose without the ban…
 </p>
 <p>
  When the fourth game was determined to be a ‘Golem Duel,’ the Korean fans resigned themselves to defeat before the players in the ‘Golem Control Room’ had even appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon seeing the size of the two countries’ golems, they were ready to give up on the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Look at the size difference, LOL. It’s like a kid fighting an adult.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Why is the support disparity so huge? Joo Ryung-Ryung wasn’t even out.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Did you miss the first game’s warrior massacre? These are players who survived competition among 1.3 billion people; excluding the top talent, there’s a baseline difference.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -This won’t do… we need to naturalize Sophia ASAP!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Fr, if we want to win Champions, we need Sophia;
 </p>
 <p>
  Facing an expected defeat in the fourth game,
 </p>
 <p>
  Korean fans began to earnestly consider the half-jested suggestion of naturalizing Sophia to boost their team’s chance.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, their focus quickly shifted back to the screen as the camera panned to the ‘Golem Control Room.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Confused comments filled the chat.
 </p>
 <p>
  -??
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Did I see that wrong, was that Seong Jihan?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Yeah; why is Seong Jihan there?
 </p>
 <br/>

 <p>
  -I thought the same thing, like we were really missing a supporter LOL
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Maybe he just wanted to play in the 4th game too…
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan firmly made his presence felt as one of the ten supporters.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Should I just focus on delivering buffs and heals to this golem core?”
 </p>
 <p>
  He eyed the core designated for him and asked a fellow supporter for confirmation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, that’s right. Buff the core and your assigned golem will become stronger. If it’s badly damaged, healing it can restore it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I see. But why is there such a big difference between our golems and China’s? What’s the reason?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The initial golem size is set based on your skills, stats, and equipment related to supporting. It seems… since Seong Jihan has no such support-related abilities, our side’s golems are smaller…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The female supporter, while kindly explaining, trailed off as she reconsidered. When accepting Seong Jihan’s participation, she had hoped his remarkable skills might enhance their golem’s baseline strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It didn’t.’
 </p>
 <p>
  On the contrary, the Korean golems turned out even smaller and more pathetic than usual.
 </p>
 <p>
  Was Seong Jihan’s entry, then, a failed endeavor?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood. Let’s perform the experiment then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… the experiment isn’t over yet?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s just starting.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, observing the core of his golem, began the test.
 </p>
 <p>
  The red orb, his golem core, showed no obvious reaction to his touch.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s try using the Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Fifth Annihilation Technique, known for providing recoverable energy akin to Elven regeneration, confirmed when Seong Jihan himself was cleaved by Dongbang Sak, was now channeled into the golem core held in his grasp.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though the life force spun through Seong Jihan’s body without effect, given his undamaged state.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  The red core sparked green, and slowly… the steel golem sprouted green leaves and tendrils.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wh-what… the golem is…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The nearby supporter, taken aback by the transformation under Seong Jihan’s guidance, was bewildered.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’m not sure if it worked as intended.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, seeing the change but puzzled by the effect, questioned.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How do I make this move?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We can only apply buffs; control is not possible. Command your golem to charge by gripping the core, starting combat. Typically, we all shout to charge once everyone’s ready, but…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Charge.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, ignoring the usual protocol as explained by the supporter,
 </p>
 <p>
  Immediately ordered his golem to charge. Then…
 </p>
 <p>
  Thump! Thump!
 </p>
 <p>
  His golem, standing among nine others, began to move first.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wh-what? Why is that one breaking ranks?”
 </p>
 <p>
  A lone golem’s surprise maneuver caught the others off guard in a battle typically fought in unison.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No… that’s Seong Jihan’s golem.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, really? Well, they can charge. Wow, its appearance has changed somewhat!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Realizing it was Seong Jihan who commanded the golem, the yelling supporter quickly soften their tone.
 </p>
 <p>
  No one dared question Seong Jihan, the core cornerstone of the team.
 </p>
 <p>
  “My apologies. It’s my first command, and I didn’t synchronize with the rest.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, it’s alright! After all…”
 </p>
 <p>
  It went unspoken that they expected to lose the game anyway.
 </p>
 <p>
  Stopping mid-sentence, that supporter, along with everyone else, widened their eyes in disbelief.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s golem, alone in its charge, crushed one of the Chinese golems.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That… can it really be destroyed so easily?’
 </p>
 <p>
  In a Golem Duel, a size difference of 1.5 to 2 times implies an equivalent advantage in performance.
 </p>
 <p>
  A smaller golem breaking another so easily was unthinkable.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Did Seong Jihan’s experiment actually work?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The supporter shouted to the others with renewed vigor.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Everyone, give the command to charge!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thump! Thump!
 </p>
 <p>
  Following the lead of Seong Jihan’s golem, the remaining Korean golems rushed towards the Chinese camp.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Golem Duel began earlier than usual with the sudden initiative.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah…! As the clash between the golems from both countries unfolds, the outcome is starting to become clear.
 </p>
 <p>
  =China has 5 golems down. Korea has… lost 8!
 </p>
 <p>
  A brutal battle between the golems of both nations showed,
 </p>
 <p>
  As expected, China had more surviving golems.
 </p>
 <p>
  If looked at just by the surviving numbers, it seemed like the battle victory would be China’s, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  -Whoa…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Seong Jihan’s golem survived again?
 </p>
 <p>
  The situation didn’t favor one side as expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Order them… hurry and destroy it! What are you doing?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Chinese coach, who had been preparing a victory interview, was shaking with rage at what he saw on-screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang! Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  Five Chinese golems circled Seong Jihan’s golem, bombarding it incessantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle!
 </p>
 <p>
  Outnumbered and out sized, Seong Jihan’s golem crumpled under the assault,
 </p>
 <p>
  Leaves and stems trampled.
 </p>
 <p>
  But then, with a flash of green light…
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s golem restored itself to its original form.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Whoa, it regenerated again, LOL
 </p>
 <p>
  – What kind of buff is that, making it immortal?
 </p>
 <p>
  Though battered to pieces, Seong Jihan’s golem restored its form time and again.
 </p>
 <p>
  It fought back, grappling with the Chinese golems, dragging them to the ground,

 </div>
 <p>
  And starting a messy, muddy brawl.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thump! Thump!
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite being hammered from every side,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s golem ferociously pounded on the Chinese one.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  Landing a decisive strike on the inner core,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Chinese golem stopped moving as its core ruptured.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Another golem of China is down!Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  =Korea has lost another too… but…
 </p>
 <p>
  =Though it’s 4:1, somehow, it feels like we might actually win this!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the tone of match commentary began to rise with unexpected developments,
 </p>
 <p>
  No one was more thrilled than the Korean fans.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Another kill added, LOL
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -It keeps getting up after taking such hits…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -If this is how it goes, even the golem duel map can’t stop Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -He’s managing all by himself, LOL
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Looks like Korea is on the path to Champions League victory…
 </p>
 <p>
  If even the Golem Duel, Korea’s weakest map, could be overcome this way,
 </p>
 <p>
  Banning Seong Jihan would be the only tactic left.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang! Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  With Seong Jihan’s golem overturning another, leaving only a 3:1 ratio,
 </p>
 <p>
  Korean fans roared in excitement, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit… it’s losing power.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, actively supplying the life-giving force to the golem core, reached his limit.
 </p>
 <p>
  Utilizing Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit, a technique not yet fully mastered, on something other than himself, took its toll.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Oh…
 </p>
 <p>
  =Leaves are vanishing…
 </p>
 <p>
  =Stems are not regenerating…
 </p>
 <p>
  As the situation boiled down to 2:1,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s golem began to shed its hands onto the ground,
 </p>
 <p>
  Losing the almost immortal regenerative capacity it had.
 </p>
 <p>
  Subsequently, Seong Jihan’s golem, which had been mighty despite its size, began to falter.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang! Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  The remaining Chinese golems pummeled it furiously.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can’t we… Can’t anything be done?”
 </p>
 <p>
  One supporter, already out of the game and observing from the sidelines, chattered nervously,
 </p>
 <p>
  “It doesn’t look good. It’s lost power.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan assessed the situation coldly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Without Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit’s effect, the game was lost.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘We’ll win next time.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Determined to increase his mastery over the Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit for the next match,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was resolute when suddenly,
 </p>
 <p>
  Tick! Tock!
 </p>
 <p>
  The beaten golem, controlled by Seong Jihan,
 </p>
 <p>
  Began to twist bizarrely.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is it… regenerating again?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, hold on.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, okay.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan hushed the supporter next to him
 </p>
 <p>
  As he watched his golem morph.
 </p>
 <p>
  The bipedal steel golem’s body contorted, and then…
 </p>
 <p>
  Clink! Clink!
 </p>
 <p>
  It transformed into a chain-like structure.
 </p>
 <p>
  =No…
 </p>
 <p>
  =What is this?
 </p>
 <p>
  Before long, only Seong Jihan’s golem core remained,
 </p>
 <p>
  With long chains dangling from it like ropes.
 </p>
 <p>
  As those chains extended in all directions, ensnaring the Chinese golems and spreading towards the sky and ground,
 </p>
 <p>
  The entire arena became enmeshed in them.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…What is that?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Crunch!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Chinese golems crumpled when wrapped by the chains.
 </p>
 <p>
  But this was just the beginning.
 </p>
 <p>
  Plunk! Plunk!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the chains reached out to the heavens and the earth,
 </p>
 <p>
  They began to constrict the space between.
 </p>
 <p>
  Right as the chains geared up to contract fully.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The fourth game concludes.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Korea wins.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The game end message appeared, and the screen went dark.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Korea equalized the score 2:2, a comeback victory.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet more striking to Seong Jihan than the win,
 </p>
 <p>
  Was the sight just before the game concluded.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Was that… the true essence of Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit?’

  Chapter 252
 </p>
 <p>
  =The fourth game…
 </p>
 <p>
  =Korea wins!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Seong Jihan as a supporter finishes the Golem Duel map, which was his weakness!
 </p>
 <p>
  The game everyone thought Korea would lose to China turned out completely unexpected.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow!! They actually won this LOL
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Knew something would happen when Seong Jihan stepped in.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -So what can be done against Seong Jihan other than banning him?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Lol, heard he was experimenting with maps designed to restrict him… but it really worked LOL
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Looks like we’re set for the Champions League this year!
 </p>
 <p>
  Golem Duel map, Seong Jihan’s only known weakness, was fully utilized by China in hopes of victory.
 </p>
 <p>
  But Seong Jihan personally overturned his weakness.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jihan… was this your experiment? Truly amazing!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Coach Noh Youngjun rushed over to greet Seong Jihan as he logged out.
 </p>
 <p>
  His face was flushed with excitement, perhaps buoyed by the game’s unexpected twist.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That last part wasn’t my intention.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh really? Anyway, the result couldn’t be better! Now we can confidently take on the Golem Duel map anytime! Heck, we might even issue the challenge ourselves!”
 </p>
 <p>
  China’s supporters were among the strongest globally.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having beaten them in a Golem Duel meant there were no teams left that Korea should fear losing to in this game.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Seong Jihan calmly replied to the still-excited coach,
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not something we can rely on going forward.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you mean…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There are significant aftereffects.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s golem, having regenerated like an elf before morphing into steel chains, had revealed a new aspect of the Fifth Annihilation Technique, Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The life energy granted to the golem is not recovering.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Before turning into chains, the force that was supposed to rejuvenate the golem core had completely vanished.
 </p>
 <p>
  The same life force showed no signs of regenerating within Seong Jihan’s body, giving him the sensation of a permanent drop in stats.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Until I fully grasp Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit, I should refrain from using it on other subjects.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even in the importance of representing his country, Seong Jihan wasn’t willing to secure victory at the expense of losing his abilities permanently.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There are side effects similar to a reduction in stats.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, that’s… not good for this map, then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, but we could feign the ability to participate.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Nodding at Seong Jihan’s words, Coach Noh Youngjun understood.
 </p>
 <p>
  Using that power means a drop in stats, so there’s no need to challenge the Golem Duel directly.
 </p>
 <p>
  But bluffing that Seong Jihan might compete might deter opponents from picking that map.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Still, if a similar situation occurs in the Space League, they’ll eventually catch on.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, the Space League is the most crucial match. I hope such a situation doesn’t arise before we make it to the Champions league.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nevertheless… I’m sorry and grateful for your sacrifice today. Next time, it’s okay to lose; don’t push yourself too hard.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I wasn’t aware of it myself. It won’t happen again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “All right. I’ll go get ready for the fifth game then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a few pats on Seong Jihan’s back, Coach Noh Youngjun left.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan pondered again about the recent unexpected occurrence.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Chains that touched the heavens, pulling them together…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The wood-attributed technique, Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit.
 </p>
 <p>
  When cleaved by Dongbang Sak’s Taiji Sword, this technique displayed the ability to restore to original conditions, akin or even surpassing elven regenerative powers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Justifying its spot in the line of absolute martial arts.
 </p>
 <p>
  But as the final technique in Annihilation, it must hold more than just regeneration…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll have to try to replicate it, but only to the point of preserving the life force.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Resolved to fully explore Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit, Seong Jihan returned to his place.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  =Everyone, it’s the fifth game! After winning the challenging fourth game on the Golem Duel map, Korea heads into the fifth!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Oh, we didn’t anticipate it. Look at the Chinese coach’s gloomy face. It’s a 180 from before the fourth game!
 </p>
 <p>
  =If I were in his shoes, I’d be devastated too! What a twist of fate!
 </p>
 <p>
  =From China’s perspective, picking a map now must be a headache.
 </p>
 <p>
  =For Korea, ah… Coach Noh Youngjun selects the Valhalla map!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Apart from game four, we’ve consistently chosen the Valhalla map card!
 </p>
 <p>
  The last face-off between Korea and China.
 </p>
 <p>
  The expressions of the two coaches were completely reversed from the previous game.
 </p>

 <p>
  “…Was Seong Jihan’s supporting ability pre-planned? If so, that’s quite the stoic facade, Coach Noh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Not that I knew.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Coach Noh Youngjun kept this thought to himself, maintaining a serene smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s no need to reveal our strategies in advance.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…You’re truly lucky. Back then it was Sword King, now it’s Seong Jihan scoring victories for you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s true. They say the best generals are the luckiest. Even if the draws haven’t always been favorable…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Coach Noh Youngjun glimpsed the map chosen for the fifth game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Following the disruption of their winning streak in the fourth game, China pulled out ‘Wizards’ Retribution,’ a map solely for mages.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Wizards’ Retribution,’ well-regarded by nations researching maps that might stifle Seong Jihan, only allowed participation from mages. Teams measured success by how many spirit kills they could amass from a tremendous distance in the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not as decisively victorious as the Golem Duel map, it fell lower on the priority list, but perhaps it was chosen because of the fourth-game shock.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The fifth game will be Wizards’ Retribution.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Chinese coach’s face brightened, if only by a shade.
 </p>
 <p>
  Had it been Valhalla, even with Seong Jihan banned, they could have lost like they did in the second game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Luckily for him, the map he desired was selected.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If Seong Jihan gets banned, we will win…!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Like in the second game, Korea banned Il-ryong instead of China’s top mage, Je Galheon. If Je Galheon lives, and Seong Jihan is banned, the fifth game, due to the difference between the mages, would surely go to China.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Chinese coach prayed for that 50 percent chance to hit, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The ban card has failed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Luck did not favor the ban card.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please do your best in the final game.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Coach Noh Youngjun, having seen the result and exhaled in relief, retreated.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the Korean team’s waiting room,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll be back after finishing the match.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, uncle. Come back with the MVP title~”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, sent off by Yoon Seah, joined the other Korean mages for the fifth game.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  The fifth game map, Wizards’ Retribution.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Entering the Grand Magic Circle.]Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  Entering the game, Seong Jihan looked around.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is this above the sky?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Floating in the sky was a giant glass sphere.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan and the Korean team stood on a glass floor embedded with magical symbols.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were 15 mages in total.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah. I’m kinda scared of heights…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Actually, being so high up, it almost doesn’t feel real, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Before the game began,
 </p>
 <p>
  The mages chatted, observing their surroundings.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whirrrr…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Light gleamed from the magical glass floor and,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Destroy the spirits hindering the tower’s construction, and cleanse the land with your magic.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Use magic towards the circle to amplify it and strike the ground.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A system message rolled up for the mages.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Magic damage gets amplified…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan, are you capable of using magic?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, just basic stuff like Fire that I learned when I changed classes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… that won’t be sufficient for this, then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The mage who had asked nodded understandingly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though Seong Jihan was powerful, a basic Fire spell couldn’t deal significant damage to the earth spirits.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It would be improper to use martial techniques here.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The amplification circle’s conditions were strictly magical.
 </p>
 <p>
  Launching powerful martial techniques here could break the glass flooring, causing a catastrophe.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked up and noticed an opening in the ceiling.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That glass sphere, There’s a gap in the ceiling. I will attempt a fall through it. Meanwhile, continue your attacks, everyone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Zoom!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan used the light step technique to exit the glass sphere.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Korean mages began casting spells towards the circle simultaneously.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s start with fire magic.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the diamond-class mages unleashed their most powerful fire spells,
 </p>
 <p>
  The magic circle quickly blazed red.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flames roared toward the earth—
 </p>
 <p>
  A pillar of fire extended from the sky as if signifying the end times.
 </p>
 <p>
  But this was met with—
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Ziiiing…
 </p>
 <p>
  A black barrier emerging from the earth, intercepting the fire.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Looks like it won’t fall that easily.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s strengthen our magic.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay. And when Seong Jihan descends, maybe the barrier will break, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, that’s possible. But let’s break the barrier before descending. We can’t rely too heavily on Seong Jihan in a mages’ map.”
 </p>
 <p>
  So, the Korean mages strove not to overburden Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  While he descended from the sky to the earth,
 </p>
 <p>
  Two more enhanced spells were cast yet,
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom! Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This barrier’s pretty tough.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The strengthened magic continued to be repelled by the barrier.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though not absolute as cracks appeared, the mages’ attempts to deal damage ended in failure before Seong Jihan’s descent.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Looks like I have to break it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, descending alone, drew the Phoenix Flag.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fundamental Divine Arts, Divine Thunder Decree – Celestial Judgment
 </p>
 <p>
  A hole tore through the sky,
 </p>
 <p>
  And a colossal spear of thunder struck directly toward the earth.
 </p>
 <p>
  The spear, half-filled with wrathful lightning pierced the barrier undamaged by several magic strikes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crash!
 </p>
 <p>
  Breaking through the barrier, Seong Jihan surveyed the area.
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon the blackened earth, there were gleaming, dark red clusters.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘These must be the targets, the spirits.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan waved his sword lightly,
 </p>
 <p>
  And instantly, the dark red spirits split apart.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even a simple slash proved insurmountable for them.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Compared to the barrier, their defenses are practically non-existent.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if it was a basic horizontal cut from Celestial Judgment, the spirit throngs were too easily cut.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan swung his sword and spear a few more times, clearing the surroundings.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Seong Jihan breaks the barrier that magic couldn’t, and he’s clearing out the spirits!
 </p>
 <p>
  =He’s really doing everything! It’s no wonder he keeps getting banned…
 </p>
 <p>
  =Indeed. While the Chinese have just managed to break the barrier. Seong Jihan has already completed the clean-up!
 </p>
 <p>
  Commentators watched Seong Jihan dominate the game, a scene shared by the viewers.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ah. Truly comfortable viewing.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -This is how games should be LOL
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -This series may be the most relaxing so far.
 </p>
 <p>
  But this ease was short-lived.
 </p>
 <p>
  =The Korean team… their score isn’t increasing!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Seong Jihan definitely made cuts, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  =Oh. Now that magic from the glass sphere descends, the score increases!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Do kills only count toward the score if made by magic?
 </p>
 <p>
  =What…? There are such restrictions?
 </p>
 <p>
  Scores weren’t reflecting kills by Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Only when magic descended from the sky did the scores increase upon the dark red spirits’ demise.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether due to the game’s prerequisite to cleanse the land with magic,
 </p>
 <p>
  Even as Seong Jihan eliminated more spirits, they weren’t tallied on the scoreboard.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm… we might lose to China this way.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Far off,
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching a torrent of thunder and lightning, Seong Jihan thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  China’s magic, visible even from afar, seemed much stronger.
 </p>
 <p>
  Likely, that was where China’s glass sphere was, with their best mage, Je Galheon.
 </p>
 <p>
  Amplified by the magic circle, his spells were overwhelmingly forceful.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No choice then…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan gripped his weapons and peered towards the Chinese glass sphere.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he couldn’t add to the score himself,
 </p>
 <p>
  He’d just have to prevent the enemy from scoring.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan vanished,
 </p>
 <p>
  =This map, Wizards’ Retribution… seems useful against Seong Jihan. It won’t count scores without magic.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Though Golem Duel failed, we can strategize with this map from now on…
 </p>
 <p>
  =Oh? Seong Jihan… he’s gone. He disappeared from the Korean area!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Where did he go…? Ah. That’s…
 </p>
 <p>
  As Korea’s score remained stagnant, the Chinese commentators switched from hopeful to dismayed broadcast.
 </p>
 <p>
  =This can’t be happening. He’s coming this way…!
 </p>
 <p>
  =This must be a foul!
 </p>
 <p>
  With Seong Jihan flying towards the Chinese glass sphere, the commentators could only express their shock.

  Chapter 254
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan reminisced about his last deal with the Brahma.
 </p>
 <p>
  After receiving the EX-grade skill of summoning the throne, he passed on the Crimson Thunder.
 </p>
 <p>
  He joyfully accepted it, but upon realizing the essence of the Crimson Thunder contained void powers he erupted in anger, questioning what he was supposed to do with such a thing.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Brahma rages at you, accusing you of breaching the contract and demands action.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Even as he vehemently criticized Seong Jihan for a while,
 </p>
 <p>
  He ultimately did not withdraw his support from The Thunder God due to his own regret.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hold on. I’ve got a message from The Thunder God, I’ll go talk and come back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “To The Thunder God?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seems like they need some help.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Go ahead~”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan waved to Sophia, who had visited as a guest, and entered his room.
 </p>
 <p>
  During that brief moment,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Thunder God ‘Brahma’ expresses fear as the wandering Martial God aggressively invades.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Thunder God ‘Brahma’ pesters you for not responding and pressures you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Switching to a stern stance for not receiving a response,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Thunder God ‘Brahma’ promises a greater reward for cooperation, apologizing for being too harsh in the past.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Thunder God ‘Brahma’ pleads for at least a response.]
 </p>
 <p>
  By the time Seong Jihan opened his room door, Brahma had switched to a pleading mode.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Brahma. Seems like he’s really in a hurry.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, looking at the system messages lowering his stance in real-time, slowly began to speak.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Using Crimson Thunder… wasn’t that all I told you last time? To utilize the void.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Thunder God ‘Brahma’ complains that even though he sacrificed immortality and utilized the void powers, the power obtained is not enough.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [He implores you to not withhold any secret techniques if you have them.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What secret technique. Shouldn’t a god like you be able to control lightning better than humans?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Silence fell upon the Brahma, seemingly displeased by Seong Jihan’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, within a few minutes, another system message popped up.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Thunder God ‘Brahma’ seeks to send an avatar.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do you accept?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzzt…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, in front of Seong Jihan, sparks flew and a small lion enveloped in red currents emerged.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master of the Crimson Thunder. Please impart the secret technique! The Martial God and their minions are currently destroying the barrier outside the Brahma’s throne!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, really, there’s no such secret. What I told you last time is all there is.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Impossible! I even sacrificed my lifespan to try using the Crimson Thunder, but failed!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “How much void did you mix?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [1, 2 percent…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mix more. Sacrifice more of your lifespan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [If I mix more, I’ll die!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The lion roared in anger at this.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s eyes sparkled upon hearing this.
 </p>
 <p>
  The essence of the void was indeed lethal to gods.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So that’s why he was so upset last time.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Regardless, that was their problem.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan shrugged.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  “The only way I know to enhance the Crimson Thunder is to mix it with the void. Any other secret technique? I’d like to know too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ugh… Really?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. I want to become stronger and hinder the Martial God.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You too? Against the Wandering Martial God?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Our relationship isn’t exactly friendly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Lion’s eyes gleamed upon hearing Seong Jihan’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you’re not on good terms with the Martial God… then, might you be willing to help me?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “If it’s about going to fight, count me out. I’m not yet ready to take on him.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I don’t expect that. But still…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzzt…
 </p>
 <p>
  The size of the Red Lion diminished,
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">

 <p>
  And blue currents began to surround its body.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Could you share a part of your sensation and help me operate the Crimson Thunder?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Share sensations?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. It won’t harm you. You just need to keep generating the Crimson Thunder.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, I’m supposed to act as a generator?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [A generator… Even with your growth, how could you possibly power up the entirety of a god? Think of it more as flipping a switch.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Lion nudged its head towards a switch in Seong Jihan’s room.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Like this. You just need to press the switch to turn on the crimson thunder.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, I can do that much. But…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [But what?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “In a few days, there’s a Space League match.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Is that really what’s important now!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. I can’t do it for long.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s not the end of the world if you miss one match!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Humanity will be in trouble without me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ugh…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzzt! Zzzzt!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Lion discharged electric currents here and there, biting its teeth in frustration.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was furious at Seong Jihan’s talk of the Space League match, considering its own dire situation against the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the more desperate party was on this side.
 </p>
 <p>
  […Fine. Go play your match. Anyway, if you operate the Crimson Thunder to strengthen the barrier, it will last longer.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay but…”
 </p>
 <p>
  […What now?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What about my reward?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Reward?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. Didn’t you say you’d give something?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That was if you had shared a secret technique…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait. So you were planning not to give anything? You’re entrusting a task to someone without giving anything in return? By the way, I prefer payment upfront now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzzt! Zzzzt! Zzzzzt…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Faced with Seong Jihan’s words, the Brahma’s body turned white, discharging electric currents in all directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  While its appearance was cute as a small lion, perhaps because it was originally a clone of the Thunder God, it showed quite a powerful force.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stop causing a fuss in my room.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan drew a circle with his finger,
 </p>
 <p>
  And the Brahma’s electric currents was trapped within, unable to escape beyond a certain distance.
 </p>
 <p>
  […If you share your senses with me, your seal of thunder stat will increase.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seal of thunder? That’s not particularly useful. Don’t you have any more EX-grade items?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [None! You think those just pop up easily?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… then the benefits are too low.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, crossing his arms and looking down, saw Brahma lower its voice in frustration.
 </p>
 <p>
  […Fine. If I survive, I’ll give you a better reward. And about the upfront payment… Your stat, was it Seal of Thunder? I’ll add 50 to it.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “50…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. Plus, sharing senses with me will rapidly increase this ability.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seal of Thunder.
 </p>
 <p>
  While it was a rare stat that could be useful for other players,
 </p>
 <p>
  For Seong Jihan, pushed aside by Martial Soul and the Void, it had become a stat he no longer paid much attention to. However, getting a straight 50 point boost in it was a different matter.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This feels somewhat like being a god of lightning.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan uncrossed his arms, smiling contentedly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright. I’ll specially help out to stop the Martial God.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […Thank you, thank you. Then, catch me now.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the previously white lion turned blue again,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded and reached out his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, a system message appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Thunder God ‘Brahma’ and the supporter Seong Jihan begin sharing sensations.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Thunder God ‘Brahma’ provides a 50 stat boost to the ‘Seal of Thunder’ in return.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You are summoned to the Brahma’s control space. Do you accept?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this a summon? But how do I get back from there?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hmm… You’re very thorough. I’ll add an option.]
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s query, the momentarily paused lion replied,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Shout “logout” to get out from Brahma’s control space.]
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  [Do you accept the summon?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Now that he had secured the option to return anytime, Seong Jihan nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I accept.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, Seong Jihan’s form vanished, engulfed in a white light.
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzzt…!
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So this is Brahma’s control space.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Summoned, Seong Jihan looked around.
 </p>
 <p>
  The space was surrounded by painfully bright white currents.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among these currents, only a tiny fraction showed a reddish hue.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  And from within these currents, a lion head popped out.
 </p>
 <p>
  [As expected, the electric charges can’t invade you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I do have some spatial control abilities.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [But to strengthen the Crimson Thunder, you’ll have to open up that space a bit.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzzt…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Two thin strands of red currents rose in front of the lion’s face.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not fully red, these Crimson Thunders had a clearly lighter touch of void.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Strengthen this.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just these two?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Haha. Try it and see.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan opened a path for the two currents approaching the void space.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzzt…
 </p>
 <p>
  The two light strands of Crimson Thunder were caught in his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So, I just need to add my Crimson Thunder to these.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan experimentally infused his own Crimson Thunder,
 </p>
 <p>
  Zap! Zap!
 </p>
 <p>
  The light-colored Crimson Thunder momentarily deepened in hue before flashing intensely and vanishing into the distance.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Indeed, yours is of higher purity…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where did it go?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Crimson Thunder you’ve strengthened is first used to reinforce the barrier. Clearly, areas mixed with Crimson Thunder have superior defense.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… Can I see that spectacle?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Currently, there’s no time for that. Once the defense becomes more solid, I’ll show it to you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, the lion disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Making a big deal out of displaying it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan had wanted to see what divine powers the Martial God used during the invasion,
 </p>
 <p>
  But Brahma didn’t easily grant his request,
 </p>
 <p>
  Adopting an attitude of showing him depending on whether he chose to assist or not.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, since I’ve received the stat points, might as well get to work.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [The rare stat ‘Seal of thunder’ has increased by 50.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Although it was an ability he hadn’t planned on investing in,
 </p>
 <p>
  The fact that a rare stat increased by 50 made it feel more manageable to use electric powers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzzt…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, absorbing the white currents and growing his stats,
 </p>
 <p>
  Certainly found it easier to wield the power of lightning compared to just holding onto the Crimson Thunder strands.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Free stat boost isn’t bad at all.’
 </p>
 <p>
  While Brahma was flustered dealing with the Crimson Thunder, Seong Jihan decided to focus on stat growth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to converting the Crimson Thunder, the growth in Seal of thunder was significantly faster.
 </p>
 <p>
  And when Seal of Thunder had grown by about 70,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The growth has slowed down.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The rapid increase came to a halt.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, noting this, decided to move on to the next step.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, Brahma. Aren’t you done yet? Ah, I’m running out of energy… I might have to rest and come back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Using a more energetic tone than ever, Seong Jihan called out to the Brahma.
 </p>
 <p>
  In response to him echoing throughout the Brahma’s control space,
 </p>
 <p>
  A system message suddenly popped up.
 </p>
 <p>
  [What are you doing here?]
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a message from Pythia, a disciple of the Martial God.

  Chapter 258
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Race.
 </p>
 <p>
  Humanity had encountered this race once before.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Remember when the Dragon Race showed up in the rehearsal game?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Yeah, they were spewing breath attacks as soon as we entered the map. They were certainly strong.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -But they still got cut down by Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Well, that was just a hatchling then…
 </p>
 <p>
  In the rehearsal map of the Chaos Battlefield, the “Blue-Scaled Dragon Race” demonstrated a significant presence.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though eventually suppressed by Seong Jihan, they left an indelible impression on the viewers who watched the games.
 </p>
 <p>
  The thought of facing such monsters in the Space League unnerved many.
 </p>
 <p>
  In astonishingly short order, the third match found humans facing the dragons.
 </p>
 <p>
  =’The ‘Red-Maned Dragons.’ They’re currently ranked second.
 </p>
 <p>
  =If they’re second, it means they’ve not only won both matches but have also been earning a lot of points.
 </p>
 <p>
  =We must defeat them this time and change our ranking position.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the opponents for the third match were determined, one of the ranked races, previously displayed as “??,” was now revealed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The “Red-Maned Dragons” stood at the top tier among the ranked races, holding the second position. Seong Jihan pondered the rankings of the Dragons.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It seems the dragons have yet to encounter the elves.’
 </p>
 <p>
  By racial specs, Dragons surpass the Elves. Nevertheless, they consistently fell short against the World Tree Elves.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once all races in the league were active, and as their match results rolled in, the Dragons never triumphed over the World Tree Elves—not even once.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, to be fair, no race has defeated the World Tree Elves…’
 </p>
 <p>
  In the Space League Bronze League, the World Tree Elves dominated spots one through five.
 </p>
 <p>
  Except for matches against each other, they remained undefeated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even so, the powerful Elves should have managed a few wins against the Dragons, yet the Elves firmly held the top five spots until humanity was relegated.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This time, let’s shake up the stagnating top ranks.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike his previous life,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan resolved to personally disrupt the rankings, watching the two races’ coaches make their appearances.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then, on the screen…
 </p>
 <p>
  =Huh…
 </p>
 <p>
  =The table isn’t showing up this time?
 </p>
 <p>
  =Are we… above the clouds?
 </p>
 <p>
  The coaches’ room, offering a scene vastly different from usual, opened up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Stepping into the cloud-covered coach’s room, Davis tentatively moved forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  Tap! Tap!
 </p>
 <p>
  One more step, and he worried he’d plunge through, but fortunately,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘These clouds can bear my weight…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The clouds supported Davis rather than evaporating like smoke beneath his steps.
 </p>
 <p>
  Relieved, Davis walked slowly until suddenly…
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoooosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Noticing a shadow closing in from his direction, he looked up.
 </p>
 <p>
  And there,
 </p>
 <p>
  […….]
 </p>
 <p>
  A colossal red dragon unexpectedly appeared before him, with no prior sign.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Is that a dragon from the Dragon Race…?
 </p>
 <p>
  =It’s huge… much bigger than the dragons seen during the rehearsal!
 </p>
 <p>
  Bigger than the hatchlings from the rehearsal, the massive dragon made Davis realize why the room had transformed into clouds—The previous coaches’ room couldn’t possibly accommodate such a tremendous creature.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swooosh…….
 </p>
 <p>
  Confronted with the dragon’s golden gaze, Davis involuntarily dropped to his knees on the clouds.
 </p>
 <p>
  The dragon’s look bore no special power, and even if it did, the default mental protection from BattleNet awarded to coaches would have blocked it.

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  ‘It’s just the presence of the dragon itself that’s terrifying…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Merely being sized up by the enormous beast instilled an instinctual threat in Davis.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Davis, why are you chickening out? You’ll lose momentum in the psychological battle!”
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Well, if I were there, I might’ve wet myself…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Oh, but he’s back on his feet now. Legs trembling, though.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Yeah, we need to use select and ban cards carefully.
 </p>
 <p>
  Davis, who crumbled momentarily, managed to stand again as cards for selecting and banning floated before him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘First, a preliminary bout is necessary.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With no information on the Dragon Race, Davis selected the most versatile option from the ban card choices, exiling three random individuals from the top ten ranks.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s pick Valhalla for the select card.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Among humanity’s players, Seong Jihan stood out as exceptional. To solidify his position, Davis chose the Valhalla map, a warrior map.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then, a flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  As light burst forth before him, Davis startled and recoiled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh… It was just a card.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the light faded, two cards chosen by the opponent were revealed. Among them, the ban card was flipped first.
 </p>
 <p>
  =The Dragon Race has made the same ban selection as Coach Davis. They ban 3 individuals within the top 10 ranks!
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘The Red-Maned Dragons’ players ranked 1, 3, and 5 have been banned from the first match. They cannot participate in the first game.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Humanity players from ranks 3, 4, and 7 have been banned. They cannot participate in the first game.]
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh, Seong Jihan’s safe!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Plus, the Dragon Race’s top rankers has been eliminated, LOL
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Davis seems spot-on with bans. Lucky draws, LOL
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite choosing the same option, the ban option favored humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Davis, seeing that Seong Jihan, ranked second, survived, breathed a sigh of relief.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Now, it’s all about the selection card…!’
 </p>
 <p>
  If only the Valhalla map was selected, it would yield the best outcome.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Davis watched as the opponent’s selection card was revealed.
 </p>
 <p>
  =The opponent’s selection card is… Oh, the Chaos Battlefield! Wasn’t that the map we played during rehearsals?
 </p>
 <p>
  =Correct. Last time they alternated matches between 10 races, but this map can also be used 1vs1, apparently.
 </p>
 <p>
  =A map quite advantageous for flying races. It appears the Dragon Race has chosen a map that showcases their strengths!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Race chose their preferred battlefield.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Coach Davis smirked to himself upon seeing this.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Seong Jihan exhibited a sure-win strategy on this map.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Chaos Battlefield, where the number of participating players dropped below 10% resulted in defeat. Seong Jihan had overcome this penalty by confining humanity’s players within the Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Valhalla would have been best, but being placed in the Chaos Battlefield isn’t the worst outcome.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching the opponent’s card being revealed positively, Davis hoped for the best.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The map for the first match has been decided.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The first match will take place on the Survival Map, the ‘Chaos Battlefield.’]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the map decided in the waiting room, Seong Jihan calmly predicted the game’s outcome.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The first match is going to be tough.’
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Chaos Battlefield.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first game commenced seemingly in favor.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Race adjustment in progress.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [For each Dragon, 50 human players are summoned equivalently.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Just like in rehearsals, where 50 humans were summoned for each Dragon, the Chaos Battlefield was filled with humanity’s representatives.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Am… I’m participating too?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I thought I was stuck on the bench forever…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The battlefield revealed the presence of all 2,000 members of the representative team.
 </p>
 <p>
  [All players selected as species representatives have been summoned.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [3,000 more players are needed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The remaining players will be summoned based on rankings.]
 </p>
 <p>
  To fill the numbers, even those not selected as representatives were summoned from Earth.

 <p>
  “Oh. I was just watching TV and… now it’s game time!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This happened during the last match against Orcs too… Seems like chances to play come more often than I thought!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Great!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the top-tier players who hadn’t made it into the representative team of 2,000 members were thrilled to get a chance to play…
 </p>
 <p>
  =Wow… They summoned 5,000 human players… Does that mean there are 100 dragons?
 </p>
 <p>
  =That’s right! And unlike the rehearsal map, human players are scattered across various regions! They’re divided into groups of 500, placed in 10 different locations!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Oh. And the defeat condition now is different from the rehearsal. If the survivors fall below 20%, they lose…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The commentators’ voices, which had been lively, turned serious as they observed the game situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  The start of the game seemed disadvantageous for humanity compared to the rehearsal.
 </p>
 <p>
  -If the number of survivors falls below 1,000, is it game over?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Yeah, with them scattered everywhere, Seong Jihan won’t be able to confine the players like he did last time
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Yeah, he trapped them all last time and carried the game alone…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Hey, the players then and now are different. Back then, they were losers, but now, they’re representatives of humanity. You think they’ll hinder Seong Jihan?
 </p>
 <p>
  During the rehearsal, the skill level of the fellow players was low. However, the players representing humanity in the Space League matches comprised the strongest individuals.
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers felt an uneasy sense about the player distribution, but they didn’t think humanity would easily fall behind.
 </p>
 <p>
  And it wasn’t just the viewers who thought this way.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Inventory.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Assigned to Chaos Battlefield, Seong Jihan intended to use Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods., but Barren, watching closely beside him,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jihan… You aren’t planning to trap us in that formation’s depth as you did in rehearsal, are you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That was the plan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No! Don’t do it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren pleaded, raising objections.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No! Don’t do it! We’re representatives of humanity! We’re not losers like last time! We can compete against the dragons!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We need to save 1,000 lives. Haven’t you seen the defeat condition?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Before we lose 1,000, we can reduce their numbers to below 20%! Why do you think we’ll lose without even trying? We are the strongest of humanity!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Phew!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan exhaled quietly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren was finally playing the troll, it seemed.
 </p>
 <p>
  He looked around.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right… Who says we can’t fight dragons?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let the dragon slayers do their job. When else if not now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “During the rehearsal game, the players participating were platinum-ranked, so that’s why we fell behind!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Hearing Seong Jihan and Barren’s exchange, several players whispered amongst themselves, seemingly agreeing with Barren.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps due to their status as the selected human representatives, they all were reluctant to be confined in the Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods without a battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Inventory.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing their reaction, Seong Jihan put the sword back into the inventory.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite their resistance, he could still use the Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods like a dictator.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But even if we do that, as soon as a few escape, we’ll lose anyway. It’s better to let them experience it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Chaos Battlefield map, where victory seemed unlikely anyway.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to awaken the reality for the players representing humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  “All right. Let’s give it a try.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow. Okay! I’ll just use my big magic…! Where are those dragon jerks?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren was eager to use magic as soon as Seong Jihan put the sword away.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No. Whether it’s big magic or small, try blocking that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As he pointed his finger towards the sky, his eyes quickly filled with shock.
 </p>
 <p>
  And understandably so.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  “The breath is coming this way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A massive flame engulfed the entire sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was rapidly descending towards them.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ahhhh! Absolute Shield…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Flustered, Barren and the others hastily deployed protective spells,
 </p>
 <p>
  But…
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Fire Breath swept through the players.

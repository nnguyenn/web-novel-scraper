  <strong>
   Chapter 26
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  “Se-Seong Jihan?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Wh-What? Why is he here? That guy who was far below the tower, how could he already…’
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s start with you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan’s hand wrapped around Kim Gyuhyuk’s head, his head burst like a balloon.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because it’s in the game, it’s like that, but if it were reality, it would have been a horrifying sight.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at Masied and slightly lowered his head.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you for stopping him.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Masied just shrugged his shoulders.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud! thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan walked to the place where Kim Gyuhyuk would resurrect.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This damn game! How could a Bronze player get here so fast from over there…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Gyuhyuk cursed as soon as he got resurrected.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite his head bursting, he still had the same spirit.
 </p>
 <p>
  Afterall, dying here wouldn’t result in a penalty of losing levels or skills disappearing.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘As if anyone’s going to save me, and the mission seems to be ruined anyway, might as well curse freely and gather some support.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking that way, Kim Gyuhyuk immediately opened his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey! You bas-…”
 </p>
 <p>
  His mouth, which was about to curse without hesitation, was caught in an instant by Seong Jihan’s left hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You aren’t afraid because it’s inside the game.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan said dully.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Senses are mostly filtered out by the Battle Net connector. Even if you die, you’ll just lose levels… Yeah, that’s probably what you are thinking.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh! B-Bubub!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Buzz.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s right hand tightly gripped Kim Gyuhyuk’s shoulder.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let me show you a world you don’t know.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Through the captured, limp body of Kim Gyuhyuk, he felt an unfamiliar energy penetrating his entire body. It was similar to the sensation when a magician manipulates the magic power of the heart. But it was a completely different energy from Kim Gyuhyuk’s magic power, It was a very cold and sharp energy.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh… Ugh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The penetrating energy tore through Kim Gyuhyuk’s whole body, twisted his muscles, and contorted his bones.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among those who learned martial arts, it was a technique called “Disjoint” , which only a few could use.
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching his own body twisting uncontrollably, Kim Gyuhyuk involuntarily broke out in a cold sweat.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s a good thing I bought an expensive Battle Net connector.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the moment when the Korean characteristic of wanting the best possible equipment, even if their tier was low, showcased.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘My body’s hurting right now, but if it’s this much…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The top-tier Battle Net connector, which reduced pain by a whopping 95%, was indeed reliable.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘By the way, I need to get damage and die asap.’
 </p>
 <p>
  “Heal.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Toward Kim Gyuhyuk, who was waiting for death, Seong Jihan used a healing spell.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the twisted interior of his body recovered, it was immediately twisted again due to Disjoint.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Damn… What a ruthless jerk.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Was he not going to let him die?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan just continued to use healing magic with an expressionless face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Heal.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Heal.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Gyuhyuk was able to stay alive because of healing magic several times.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Idiot. Does he think I’ll lose that easily… Huh?’
 </p>
 <p>
  While enduring the pain somehow, Kim Gyuhyuk, who was determined to stand firm to the end.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh… Ughhh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Maintaining his pride, he hadn’t even groaned before that,But the pain that suddenly surged like a thorn became unbearable.
 </p>
 <p>
  “W-What? What happened? Why does it hurt so much!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Gyuhyuk screamed as he writhed on the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a level of pain entirely different from what he had experienced so far.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  Every hair on his body stood on end, a sensation that made him wish he could just die.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ughhh… System check!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ding! Everything is normal.]
 </p>
 <p>
  For a moment, he thought the Battle Net connector might have malfunctioned.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the connector was working perfectly fine.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Heal.”
 </p>
 <p>
  And Seong Jihan mechanically cast healing magic, whether Kim Gyuhyuk was writhing on the ground or not.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Heal.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Heal.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The sound of recovery magic echoed multiple times.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ughhhh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Amidst the agony, Kim Gyuhyuk felt something ominous.
 </p>
 <p>
  He felt as if something more painful was awaiting him.
 </p>
 <p>
  More precisely, he thought there was no way Jihan would let it end like that, And he was right…
 </p>
 <p>
  When healing had probably reached Kim Gyuhyuk’s body for the tenth time.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh, uhh, ughhh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, Kim Gyuhyuk let out an animalistic scream, then his body transformed into light and disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though healing had been used, he still died and the cause of death was fainting due to unbearable pain.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the spot where Kim Gyuhyuk had vanished and muttered blankly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can’t endure even this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan waited quietly at the place where Kim Gyuhyuk would resurrect for the third time.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then…
 </p>
 <p>
  Pah-aat-
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sorry! I’m really sorry! I was wrong… Ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Gyuhyuk resurrected, his body trembling, Seong Jihan, with an expressionless face, covered his mouth again.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  – …It’s scary.

 <p>
  – Suddenly, the atmosphere turned into horror.
 </p>
 <p>
  – I…I can’t watch anymore T_T
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers who had been watching Seong Jihan’s channel were bewildered.
 </p>
 <p>
  In fact, while the sight of Kim Gyuhyuk’s body twisting might appear repulsive to watch, most viewers found a certain satisfaction in his current state due to the curses he had been throwing around.
 </p>
 <p>
  But…
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing Gyuhyuk roll on the floor while he frothed at the mouth made them feel something beyond discomfort.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Gyuhyuk genuinely appeared as if he was feeling pain.
 </p>
 <p>
  – But why is he having such convulsions?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Yeah, the Battle Net connector reduces pain, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Is he acting?
 </p>
 <p>
  – It feels too real for that…
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers might not have understood why Kim Gyuhyuk was acting that way. However, Battle Net experts engaged in heated discussions, sensing that there might be something underlying.

 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">

   Perhaps because Disjoint was used with less force this time, Kim Gyuhyuk, who had withstood the pain longer than before, finally succumbed to agony and died.

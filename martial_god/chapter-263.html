  Chapter 263
 </p>
 <p>
  In a conference room located on the third basement floor of the World BattleNet Association building in New York,
 </p>
 <p>
  representatives of the BattleNet associations from various countries had gathered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “A total of 8 countries have received messages from the BattleNet system…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just like they said, it would be the top 8 ranking countries from last year. It’s really happening.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Has everyone kept the secret well?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The American First representative cautiously looked around as the representatives from various countries nodded seriously.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ve reported to our governments, but they were even more cautious about not spilling it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s necessary. We don’t want stories about the ‘bonus’ to spread and cause us headaches.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The national representatives discussed, recalling the events of the past few days.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the day that the human representative team triumphed in the battle against the Dragon Race, claiming a good mood from the three wins in the league,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The first three matches in the Space League have concluded.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [From now on, bonuses will be given to facilitate smooth league progress for all races.]
 </p>
 <p>
  People could see this system message, but unlike the public who only saw these two lines,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Please choose a bonus item.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The right to choose a bonus item will be given to countries ranked 1st to 8th in last year’s Champions League.]
 </p>
 <p>
  An additional message inviting the association heads to choose a bonus item appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Glad we did well last year.’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What immense power.’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Thank goodness for the Sword King’s performance in the Champions League last year.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Notably, the United States and China, rivals for the top 1 and 2 spots every year, and Japan, which had not been performing well in 2021, were allowed to participate in this secret conference due to the basis of last year’s rankings.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Have you taken a look at the bonus items?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There are lots of good ones.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Additional experience bonuses for players, increased gift generation probability… all items necessary for us humans.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The 8 country representatives smiled meaningfully at each other.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Efficiency is most important for these items, isn’t it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Indeed. Bonus items that apply to everyone seem to have less efficiency.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “BattleNet is ultimately a game played by a small selection of elite players. We must focus and choose our bonuses wisely.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The right to choose the bonus item that will apply to humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  The options given by BattleNet included more than a dozen possibilities, such as a 30 percent bonus to experience and a 10 percent increase in gift generation probability,
 </p>
 <p>
  which, while good, weren’t exactly game-changers for the players’ development.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right. ‘National Bonus Enhancement’ seems to be the best option… right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The leading countries should continue to guide humanity, shouldn’t they?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The focus of the 8 national presidents was the national bonus enhancement option.
 </p>
 <p>
  This option provided differential bonuses to players based on the ranking of their country, including increases in experience and GP acquisition, among other benefits.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It‘s true. According to calculations, the countries up to the top 20 spots benefit significantly.”CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, but how does the Japanese representative feel about this? It will be bad for you once this year’s rankings are out, especially since the Sword King is gone and recent performances haven’t been good.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha! The Chinese representative speaks too much. Whether our performance has been good or bad, we can certainly maintain our position within the top 20 world rankings.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah! Is that so? Well, that’s reassuring.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Japanese association president chafed at the Chinese president’s teasing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, regarding national bonus enhancement, they were all agreeable.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm. It seems we’ve reached some consensus.”
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  “Does anyone disagree with enhancing the national bonus?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, that’s the correct judgement.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The 8 representatives looked at each other and nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  The option was quickly decided, perhaps due to some prior coordination before entering the conference room.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then… we’ll have to wait for him.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The secret conference was not over yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  The bonus item to be applied to all of humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  [A player affiliated with ‘Space 4′ Area has been detected.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Player ‘Seong Jihan’ is also given the additional option to choose.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [For smooth league progression, please select your bonus item!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan had the right to choose as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon afterward,
 </p>
 <p>
  Knock, knock!
 </p>
 <p>
  “I guess I’m the last one.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan entered the room as the door to the conference room opened.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘After the main BattleNet game, I was wondering why the national bonuses were so strengthened…’
 </p>
 <p>
  So this was the reason.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recalled how in his previous life, even though he was the true ace of the United States, he only managed to rank seventh,
 </p>
 <p>
  second only to Barren, who was difficult to surpass due to his two status windows gifts.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how well he performed, his rankings just wouldn’t rise, which he thought was quite unfair at the time.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Now the tables have turned.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In his previous life, Korea’s rankings plummeted, and it ultimately fell into ruin due to the dungeon portals.
 </p>
 <p>
  But this time was different.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this life, in 2021, Korea was not facing the threat of annihilation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead, it was viewed as a superpower capable of challenging the 3rd and 4th place in the BattleNet world rankings.
 </p>
 <p>
  Korea, which would benefit from the ‘national bonus enhancement,’ and the cause for this was.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Player Seong Jihan. You’ve arrived!”
 </p>
 <p>
  All 8 national association heads stood up from their seats as he entered the room.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your dominant performance defeating the dragons in the last game was truly impressive.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Space League 3-game win streak is all thanks to player Seong Jihan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Have you looked at the bonus options? We’d like to hear your opinion, player Seong Jihan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  They approached Seong Jihan, greeting him with full smiles across their faces.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed as though he was regarded as the superior to the association presidents, an exceptional being beyond competition.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The dragon’s onslaught was so easily overcome… how can a human even do that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  They approached Seong Jihan in a submissive demeanor, a result of his impact on the previous game.
 </p>
 <p>
  The power Seong Jihan demonstrated in dominating the Dragon Race after one game appealed to everyone to not see him as a competitor anymore,
 </p>
 <p>
  but as an extraordinary figure to be revered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at them briefly before speaking.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems the presidents have already discussed some ideas about the bonus options.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, we have talked among ourselves.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That… ‘National Bonus Enhancement Option’ seemed to be the best.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “National bonus… Is that better than the other options?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan scanned the room.
 </p>
 <p>
  The representatives from the United States and China, who would benefit the most, quickly spoke up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course, there were bonuses that would focus on the top players, but when calculated… they’re more inefficient than the national bonuses for the top 20 countries.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “And with player Seong Jihan’s ranking expected to rise greatly this year, once the rankings are set again, Korea will be able to enjoy the benefits of the national bonus.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The national bonus is a win-win choice for everyone!”
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  The two normally disagreeable country representatives cooperated to persuade Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  It also symbolized the collusion of the privilege-bearing countries to solidify their position.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘When it’s your turn to choose, you understand. Compared to the others, the national bonus is too advantageous.’
 </p>
 <p>
  While the national bonus focused benefits on the higher ranks,
 </p>
 <p>
  from a perspective of selectivity and concentration, it was the most efficient.
 </p>
 <p>
  In his previous life, Korea didn’t benefit, but now it could reap the rewards with Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Joining them in agreement wouldn’t hurt as before, and it only promised benefits through the national bonus.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’d like to make the option selection in a public conference.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who had the authority to choose the bonus option, preferred public consensus over a backroom deal.
 </p>
 <p>
  “A public conference… you say?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s a bit… Would there be no problems? We wouldn’t get the best efficiency.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Lower-ranked countries will definitely oppose it if we decide on a national bonus in public…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The association heads expressed concerns at Seong Jihan’s suggestion.
 </p>
 <p>
  After all, only a maximum of 20 countries would enjoy the national bonus benefits.
 </p>
 <p>
  The rest would be at a disadvantage compared to other bonus options.
 </p>
 <p>
  But if we go into a public conference, show these conditions, and choose the national bonus enhancement,
 </p>
 <p>
  would the other countries just stand by and watch?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Why on earth does he want to go public with this power?’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can’t understand. It’s a proposal that would certainly benefit Korea and Seong Jihan himself…’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is he planning a top-strata concentrated bonus option? Even if we vote on that in a general assembly, it would be hard to get it passed.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The presidents smiled outwardly but were seething on the inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  The leaders of the top echelons needed to make a wise choice.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it went public, lower-efficiency bonuses would be selected due to the interests of each country…
 </p>
 <p>
  Why was he doing this?
 </p>
 <p>
  “If it’s made public, everyone will opt for a bonus that benefits all.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Boosting the gift appearance rate by 10 percent or adding experience… such options are insufficient compared to the national bonus. If player Seong Jihan, now the number 1, gets banned, other human players also need to grow quickly to do their part… What happens if we choose such an option?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right now, no one knows we can ‘choose’ such options. If we agree among ourselves and move on, there won’t be any issues.”
 </p>
 <p>
  While pleading earnestly to Seong Jihan,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shall we turn on BattleTube right here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, no. Why do you…!?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This isn’t just for us. The national bonus is the option we need to efficiently navigate through the Space League!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I know. But let’s do it publicly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, no…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s stance was firm.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I also planned to choose the national bonus before boarding the plane.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In his previous life, the national bonus meant a loss for Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  But this time, it was undoubtedly a benefit, so he initially intended to choose it.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh, Seong Jihan. Can you see the message?
 </p>
 <p>
  But in the airplane,
 </p>
 <p>
  -You overlooked the free prophecy last time but I couldn’t just let it pass.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having heard the prophecy from Pythia, a disciple of the Martial God, he changed his mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Share the bonus option items you received this time with the world. New options will emerge then.
 </p>
 <p>
  -And that… will save you later.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A bonus… to save me?’
 </p>
 <p>
  What kind of option would come out that could literally be life-saving?
 </p>
 <p>
  Curiosity aroused, Seong Jihan preferred to negotiate publicly over a backroom agreement.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s make it public,” he strongly advocated during the public meeting.
 </p>
 <p>
  And eventually, as if unable to understand each other, the association heads of the eight countries looked at each other.

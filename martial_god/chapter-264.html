  Chapter 264
 </p>
 <p>
  The news from the BattleNet Association in New York quickly spread across the globe.
 </p>
 <p>
  Those who thought they were just getting a bonus after three matches had ended began to immerse themselves in analysis like experts after seeing the option items.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Bonus option? Was this what we were supposed to choose?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -So there was a choice for the representatives of the Eight Countries and Seong Jihan?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -If this wasn’t made public, we would have never known;
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Why did they disclose it? Wasn’t this supposed to be agreed upon behind the scenes? LOL
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -The national bonus seems to be the most efficient, right?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Only 20 countries actually benefit from it, isn’t choosing it somewhat unfair? Won’t it cause issues of equity?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Still, players from those 20 countries make up 90 percent of the human representative team… Shouldn’t we just focus on training the elites?
 </p>
 <p>
  The national bonus was certainly the most controversial among the bonus options.
 </p>
 <p>
  Its efficiency was far superior compared to other options, which led to heated debates among people.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, three days after this fact became known.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Starting now, we will begin the meeting to select the bonus option.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In the open meeting room of the New York BattleNet Association,
 </p>
 <p>
  representatives from numerous countries’ associations were gathered, cautiously exchanging opinions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s the procedure today?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The representatives with choice rights will speak, and then the heads of each country’s association will vote on the bonus option.”Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s surprising. Only representatives of the Eight Countries and Seong Jihan have the right to choose options, right? They could have just decided among themselves…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It was Seong Jihan who insisted on a public meeting.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s fine by us, but why go to such lengths…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Normally, the heads of the associations would have no voting rights.
 </p>
 <p>
  One way for these association heads to gain authority would have been through an opportunity given by Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  But it led people to wonder why he made such a decision.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan will take the podium last. Then we’ll understand his thoughts.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But where does the Mexican association head plan to cast their vote?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re leaning towards increasing the probability of gift occurrences. One exceptional player can change the rank of a country. We must also seek such luck.”
 </p>
 <p>
  While the national bonus might seem better for the efficiency of humanity as a whole…
 </p>
 <p>
  For countries not in the top 20, it was like being cheerleaders for the leading nations.
 </p>
 <p>
  In light of their own interests, people were guessing which option would be chosen amidst subtle exchanges.
 </p>
 <p>
  Drrrrrrr!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They are finally entering…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The representatives of the Eight Countries, along with Seong Jihan, entered the meeting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Hence, we in the UK have concluded that we must choose the ‘national bonus’ option.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The representatives of the Eight Countries, taking turns to give speeches, stood before the world’s focused attention advocating for the selection of the national bonus option.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Of course, the powerful nations speak in their favor tsk tsk.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -But isn’t that a good thing for us too?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Right… isn’t our battle industry line considered one of the powerhouses?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Recently we’re raking in so many ranking points. TOP 10 next year seems guaranteed, and even rank 5 is attainable, right?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Not just Seong Jihan, but Sword King and Yoon Seah are earning a lot of points in BattleNet…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Yeah. We’re also doing well, aren’t we? So we should support the national bonus?
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Korean viewers favored the national bonus,
 </p>
 <p>
  -National bonus… Doesn’t that mean the top countries will monopolize the benefits?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -If this goes on, the gap between countries will never close.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -The mood might be good for now but if our BattleNet rankings fall, aren’t dungeons going to pop up like mushrooms…? Shouldn’t we aim for balanced development among players?
 </p>
 <p>
  People from nations not in the top 20 were not pleased with the idea.

 <p>
  This sentiment was evident among the attending representatives from various countries.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re supposed to represent humanity but… isn’t this just national self-interest?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “For mid-tier countries, this bonus would be nearly ineffective.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We oppose the national bonus option.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Many representatives publicly expressed their opposition.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Figures this would happen.’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Shouldn’t have made the option public…’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This was good for Korea and him. So why did Seong Jihan make this choice?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The chaotic meeting room was being broadcast live and the representatives looked at Seong Jihan with a mix of complaints and expectations.
 </p>
 <p>
  Why try for the difficult path when an easy agreement could be reached?
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, Seong Jihan, with arms folded, was simply watching the situation unfold.
 </p>
 <p>
  If Pythia’s prophecy was accurate, revealing everything should lead to a new option.
 </p>
 <p>
  But no such option had emerged yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Prophecy… Useless, perhaps. They said a new option would arise.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If he recalls correctly, Pythia claimed to be Nostradamus, but the world didn’t end in 1999.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So. Last but not least, a word from player Seong Jihan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After the representatives had finished their speeches,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who had received Pythia’s prophecy and was climbing the steps toward the podium, was greeted by a round of applause far stronger than the rest.
 </p>
 <p>
  Knowing he had insisted on the public meeting, association presidents from other countries displayed a favorable attitude towards him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh, it’s Seong Jihan’s turn?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -I’m so relieved I turned on the broadcast in time.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -In the office secretly watching, even the team leader is watching the same thing LOL
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Our company just had it on for all employees LOL
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as Seong Jihan’s turn arrived, the number of viewers tuning into the conference, which had already been drawing the world’s attention, skyrocketed.
 </p>
 <p>
  They wanted to know why the best player in humanity went to such lengths to hold a public meeting space.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, facing everyone’s gaze, remained calm.
 </p>
 <p>
  Making such a meeting public meant he had a plan of his own which everyone anticipated.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Though I have no such thing.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, with a wry smile forming at his lips, was about to speak.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You are ranked 1st in the world.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You belong to the ‘Space 4’ elite area.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have received MVP three times or more in the Space League.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your race ‘humanity’ has 1/5 of the Constellation’s attention.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [There exists a constellation fully encompassing your planet… It does not exist.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have achieved all the conditions to be a ‘Constellation Candidate’ of planet ‘Earth’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Following the completion of all conditions,
 </p>
 <p>
  [A hidden bonus option is revealed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hidden bonus option, ‘Star Chaser,’ is activated.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia’s prophecy came true.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, right before giving his speech, gazed at the newly added option.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Star Chaser]
 </p>
 <p>
  All players start chasing after the ‘Constellation Candidate’ who gained the right early on.
 </p>
 <p>
  The wider the gap from the first rank, the greater all aspects of their growth rate become.
 </p>
 <p>
  The longer the 1st rank maintains their position, the stronger this effect becomes.
 </p>
 <p>
  If this option is in effect and the 1st rank maintains their position for more than 300 days,
 </p>
 <p>
  That player will officially become a ‘Constellation Candidate’.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The ranking 1st and future ‘Constellation Candidate’ player’s gap closing bonus option.
 </p>
 <p>
  The provided buff was overwhelming just by a rough calculation, significantly surpassing the much-debated national bonus.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But for me, it’s actually useless.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The bonus option ‘Star Chaser,’ urging everyone to catch up with the front-runner, did not provide a growth bonus to the actual leader.
 </p>
 <p>
  It instead gave a chase opportunity to those behind, an apparent loss for the option holder.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Seong Jihan focused on the last line.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I stay on top for 300 days, I can become a Constellation Candidate.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Since the fight with the Dragon Race in the Space League, Seong Jihan had been ranked 1st,
 </p>
 <p>
  his margin over second-placed Oliver, though narrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was confident in maintaining the top spot.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Not sure how this relates to my life but…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if it didn’t align with saving his life, as Pythia’s prophecy had mentioned,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Star chaser’ was compelling enough to be chosen.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Player Seong Jihan… Why are you silent?”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Are you nervous?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Would he even feel nervous? It seems like he’s looking at something…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He seems to be tapping the air, is that a system message?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The murmuring heads of the associations watched as Seong Jihan stood quietly on the podium.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ladies and gentlemen. A new option has just been added. Would the Eight Countries association heads like to check for themselves?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This, this is…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just moments ago, there was nothing…!?”
 </p>
 <p>
  With Seong Jihan’s prompt, the association heads checked the options and their eyes widened in disbelief.
 </p>
 <p>
  An option that hadn’t been there just moments ago, had suddenly appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The newly added option is known as ‘star chaser.’ The ‘star’ referred to here is, of course, me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  While sharing the option content,
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow, what’s this… The further behind from 1st place, the bigger the buff?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -This suits humanity, doesn’t it? The effects are far better than the national bonus.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -But Seong Jihan won’t get the buff then ‘-‘
 </p>
 <p>
  People marveled at the buff effects, yet showed concern that Seong Jihan himself was excluded.
 </p>
 <p>
  But on his part,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s go with this bonus option.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Is that really alright, Player Seong Jihan? You won’t receive the benefits.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s fine. Even without that, I’ll keep the top rank. The Constellation Candidate, that sounds tempting.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan expressed confidence in keeping the top position for over 300 days.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If the player himself says so…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then we are also in favor.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Except for Seong Jihan, the new bonus option conditions were advantageous for everyone else.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though there was some trepidation over the ‘Constellation Candidate’ provision,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Constellation Candidate… It’s only a candidate in the end, isn’t it?’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Perhaps it’s better if a modern human like us becomes a Constellation instead of others.’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This option gives an incredible advantage to those behind. Growth is the priority now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The association heads, viewing ‘Constellation Candidate’ as something distant and intangible, opted for practical benefits.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s proceed to the vote.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The results of the vote are…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “By unanimous decision, ‘Star Chaser’ has been adopted as the bonus option!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang! Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  The bonus option was unanimously agreed upon.
 </p>
 <p>
  A meeting room that had been on the brink of conflict over the national bonus was now harmoniously united thanks to this development.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Was the public conference for… this option…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Player Seong Jihan. Did you foresee this? We had no idea!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What a revelation. It would have been good if you had tipped us off in advance…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The representatives, who looked markedly different from a few days’ prior, approached and bantered with bright faces.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Had I informed you earlier, it might have clouded the prophecy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, with a slight smile, responded while still mulling over one part of the message that had activated ‘star chaser’.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The existence of a constellation that fully encompasses your planet… it does not exist.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What does this mean… does it exist or not?’ There were Constellations from humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even among the disciples of the Martial God, from Longinus to Pythia, all were Constellations.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether they fully encompassed Earth, however, was uncertain.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to ask Pythia about this once I contact her.’
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  In the star of martial gods, Tu seong.
 </p>
 <p>
  And at its center, the throne seized from the Thunder God, blazed brilliantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash! Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  While explosions echoed,
 </p>
 <p>
  Shhhhh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The seat on which the Martial God had been sitting earlier now collected a fierce surge of electrical energy.
 </p>
 <p>
  One element in the throne remained unabsorbed, streaks of red lightning resisting to the end.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Master has failed to absorb these fulminant red currents completely.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang sak observed the spectacle from a distance, his gaze settling.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  While immersed in absorbing energy, the Martial God spoke softly.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dongbang sak.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, Master.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [How goes the pursuit of the remnants of the Thunder God?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Pythia is on it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Join her, capture them.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle…
 </p>
 <p>
  With a pensive look, Dongbang sak gazed at the fulminant red lightning, the last resisting presence in the throne.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Understood.”

  Chapter 266
 </p>
 <p>
  The World Tree Elves.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was already the third time humanity encountered this race in the Space League.
 </p>
 <p>
  The number associated with this batch of World Tree Elves was 99.
 </p>
 <p>
  -This time it’s the World Tree Elf – 99?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -71, 200, 99. The numbers are quite diverse, haha.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Whoa, but two teams above us are all World Tree Elves. Even our opponent, 71, is in 7th place.
 </p>
 <p>
  The World Tree Elf 200 holds the 1st place, while the newly appeared World Tree Elf – 99 takes the 2nd place. They are among the top ranks.
 </p>
 <p>
  -The points gained by the 1st and 2nd place are quite similar. It won’t be strange if the rankings change.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Ugh, but the 3rd place, ??, has similar points too? Are they also World Tree Elves?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Ah, seriously, these Elves are so dominant…
 </p>
 <p>
  Although humanity won against the World Tree Elves in the first match, most viewers knew it wasn’t because humanity played well. The Elves intentionally didn’t use their cards and tricked around to execute the players.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the match had proceeded officially, humanity would have definitely lost.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Five teams of World Tree Elves… And yet humanity is still 4th, probably because they played inter-squad matches.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan scrolled through the ranking table which had opened up after ?? disappeared, recalling the old days before humanity’s fall.
 </p>
 <p>
  While humanity shared the bottom ranks with the Orcs, the World Tree Elves recorded four losses each from 1st to 5th place.
 </p>
 <p>
  They divided win-loss amongst themselves when they got matched up.
 </p>
 <p>
  The 6th place Dragon Race had lost only to elves, with ten losses.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Considering the past, our current rank seems like a miracle.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Overwhelming dominant forces like the elves and the Dragon Race had been defeated by humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But we can’t be satisfied with the current performance. We have to continue advancing and graduate from the Bronze League and be freed from BattleNet.’
 </p>
 <p>
  For that to happen, they had to perform well not only in official league matches.
 </p>
 <p>
  but also in league competitions and regular BattleNet games taking place.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the league went on, even if the official league matches went poorly, previous points earned could leave a team still ranking high.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Planet Exploration… Used to start off well but was always swept away by the elves.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The last time they played ‘Planet Exploration,’ humanity huddled at the bottom,
 </p>
 <p>
  eventually wiped out by elves or the Dragon Race.
 </p>
 <p>
  But this time around, humanity managed to sustain a top position before being suddenly raided and defeated by the elves.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Coordinating guilds properly in three days might be challenging.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In his past life, this was when humanity suffered three consecutive losses, sinking to the bottom ranks, leaving a dire mood.
 </p>
 <p>
  Guilds from various countries fiercely clashed to gain benefits in the league competition.
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, though, the circumstances had unfolded much more favorably than before.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle, Lee Hayeon is asking you to come to the guild.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Lee Hayeon? For the league competition?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. There’s an issue with the lineup.”
 </p>
 <p>
  For this league competition, 25 players could be fielded from the Daegi guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, most of the Daegi guild members were on loan, so traffic control was necessary to determine the lineup.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright, I’ll go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  In the Daegi guild’s master room.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Boss, it’s been a while since we last met!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Indeed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon greeted Seong Jihan with a smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve been wanting to thank you in person, Boss. You’ve been so busy that it’s been hard to catch a glimpse of you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you? What did I do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You became 1st in the ranking!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “And why is that?”
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked puzzled, prompting Hayeon to smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It was because of my Gift ‘Nurturing’ growth condition. It requires one of the guild members to become 1st in the ranking.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh… right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehe. Didn’t you feel the effect? I enhanced the experience point buff significantly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now that you mention it, I did feel like I was leveling up faster.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recalled the general games he played over the past few days.
 </p>
 <p>
  With 2-3 levels gained after each game, he thought it was just because he belonged to Space 4.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So there was an experience boost as well.’
 </p>
 <p>
  No wonder the growth rate was so rapid. Currently, in mid-April, his level was 291. At this rate, he could reach level 300 by the end of the month and challenge the Master League promotion for the first time in human history.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What exactly are the effects of SSS-grade nurturing?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, first, it allows for the enhancement of the nurturing buff ‘Supercharge’ for one player. Additionally, it increases the probability of grade advancement for Gifts.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow. Even for Gifts?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. And it also enhances the effects of existing buffs.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Lee Hayeon spoke, her eyes sparkled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s said that if you raise a ‘Master of the Stars’, the nurturing effect will be even stronger…… It means the constellation, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If it’s the Master of the Stars, then yes, I suppose so.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Exactly…Boss. You’ll keep receiving my buff, right? We need to keep winning together!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course. Such buffs are always welcome.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The SSS-grade nurturing buff, which showed potential for further growth even after reaching the highest grade, made Seong Jihan think that appointing Lee Hayeon as guild master was a masterstroke.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, the meeting began on a warm note.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Firstly, Boss. Here’s the guild operation report for your review.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Before getting started, Lee Hayeon handed Seong Jihan a thick file.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ve handled it well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He returned the report to her without looking at it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You really have no interest in guild management. Won’t you at least skim through it? What if I embezzled funds?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Embezzlement? Feel free to take it all. As long as you stay as guild master.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After selling the invitation to the Pleasure Palace from the Succubus Queen and being freed from GP constraints, Seong Jihan cared more about Lee Hayeon’s nurturing buff than the income from the Daegi guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, how could I do that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You really can take it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Having you as our boss brings glory to our Daegi guild, like today’s matter.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon prompted a new window on her monitor.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the title [Request for Lineup Composition of Daegi Guild], names of world-renowned players began to roll out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Names from 2nd ranked Oliver from the United States all the way to the top 100 were listed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “These are the names of people who want to participate in the league competition as part of our Daegi guild. Every single person from world ranks 2 to 100 has requested to join the Daegi guild.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They’re not competing under their own guilds?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan repeated incredulously.
 </p>
 <p>
  He thought there was a lineup issue with the loaned players wanting to return to their own guilds to compete.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, after coming down and hearing it, not only those on loan, even other players were all vying to get into the Daegi guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  “When I spoke with the other guild authorities last time… everyone unanimously agreed that our guild should be the ‘First Guild’.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The First Guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this Planet Exploration, all participating races had to designate a First Guild. The members of the First Guild received a significant boost called the ‘First Pioneer’ buff compared to other guild members. However, if all members of the First Guild died, there was an immediate loss penalty in the league competition.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The First Guild? American First or The People’s Association didn’t want it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Everyone willingly conceded it to us.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “More like the lady here made them yield. If they didn’t want to compromise on their positions in the guild, they’d better support quietly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh my, Gayeong. Someone might think I threatened them. Isn’t it natural for our Daegi guild, housing the world’s number 1 and future Constellation Candidate, to lead the First Guild, right? I just logically persuaded them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon had neatly set the stage.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a grin, Seong Jihan quietly nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was already going to obtain it, but you sorted things out beforehand. Well done, Hayeon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehe. No worries~ So what shall we do with this list?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “For the other 19 guilds competing, let’s choose one person from each.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “One person each, not going by the ranking?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. With the ‘First Pioneer’ buff, it seems better for players with this to lead their respective guilds.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The details about the ‘First Pioneer’ buff, provided by BattleNet beforehand, only mentioned that the members of the First Guild would be significantly strengthened compared to ordinary guild members. Lee Hayeon’s eyes twinkled with interest as Seong Jihan spoke with a peculiar certainty about it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Boss… is this another one of your premonition dreams?”
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  “It’s just speculation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm~ Any chance I appeared in your premonition dreams? Now that I think about it, you were quite convinced and recruited me because of the ‘Nurturing’ Gift that I gave up on.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m curious too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Not only Hayeon but even Lim Gayeong standing behind showed a face full of curiosity as they questioned Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Following the recent unveiling of the hidden bonus, Seong Jihan’s supposed ability to see the future had become an accepted truth.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I only know bad endings about them.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan smiled wryly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lim Gayeong died by the hands of the Sword King.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon lived as a gambling addict, her face charred.
 </p>
 <p>
  But that future was no longer plausible.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sword King had returned to Korea.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hayeon had given up gambling and shared her gift abilities worldwide.
 </p>
 <p>
  He replied lightheartedly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well… Hayeon, don’t gamble.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I quit a long time ago!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Gayeong, make sure you have plenty of GP.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “GP… Is that so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. So you can resurrect anytime in BattleNet. Plenty of it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did I die in the future?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Knowing Seong Jihan’s accuracy, Lim Gayeong asked with a shaking voice, unlike her usual self.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nope. Just, be cautious.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Exiting the guild master’s room, Seong Jihan left the ladies with serious expressions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Miss. Please advance my salary.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright. I’ll give you ten years’ worth.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a hurry, Lee Hayeon immediately transferred the GP right there.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though Seong Jihan spoke lightly, both of them took it very seriously.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Three days later.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The league competition, ‘Planet Exploration,’ begins.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Humanity’s First Guild is the ‘Daegi Guild.’]
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  Members of the First Guild, the Daegi Guild, were summoned first.
 </p>
 <p>
  Followed by members from the remaining 19 guilds.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this the planet to explore…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this a desert? It looks desolate. What are we supposed to do here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As players chatted among themselves and looked around, a message appeared to them.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Explore the planet, establish a colony, and control competing races!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Races with completed colonies will receive continuous rewards based on colony completion.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “A colony…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They don’t clearly tell us what rewards they’ll give.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Still, they might give us good rewards by the time of the competition, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  While ordinary players saw only two lines in the message,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Epic Quest]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Completely settle the colony and ascend to the Hall of Fame.]
 </p>
 <p>
  -Reward: Absorption and enhancement of the abilities of the constellation
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If it’s the abilities of the constellations… Does that mean… Martial Soul?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was met with an epic quest and a surprisingly amazing reward.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it meant enhancing Martial Soul, this quest was imperative to complete.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Would you like to check the Hall of Fame?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Hall of Fame window appeared, a list of up to 100 names appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Just need to be within the top 100.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Since he wouldn’t recognize the names anyway,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was only checking the scores behind the list when he widened his eyes at the name in the 100th place.
 </p>
 <p>
  [100th – Artemus]
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a familiar name to him.

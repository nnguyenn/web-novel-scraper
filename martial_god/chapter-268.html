  Chapter 268
 </p>
 <p>
  [Intrusion into the territory of the ‘Zojin’ race during the Pioneer Protection period. The ‘Conflict Suppression’ debuff is applied. All attributes decrease by 70%.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The ‘Zojin’ race receives the ‘Pioneer Protection’ buff. They receive a buff that doubles their attributes against invaders.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The debuff is lifted when outside the territory of the Zojin race.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [*Note: You are a leader. If you die here, the entire race will be eliminated from the league competition.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud! Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan indifferently watched the messages pouring in and kept moving forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘My body feels quite heavy.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Only able to use 30% of his usual strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  Until a moment ago, he could summon up to five Celestial Judgments, but now even two seemed impossible.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Intruders from humanity? That’s the fourth-ranked race.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Coming here alone… He’s got some nerve.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s tear him apart and feast on his flesh right away!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t you remember the last match? He might be as powerful as an elf. Call our kin who were out there!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey! The buffs and debuffs have already been applied, so why bother against one guy!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whiff! Whiff!
 </p>
 <p>
  Some Zojin flew swiftly towards Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  The recently sped-up Zojin Tribe had been fully reaping the benefits from their doubled stats.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll eat that human’s eyes first!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The golden-winged bird-headed human arrived before the others.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at him and widened his eyes slightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He was the one who ranked first among the Zojin race in the future.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Although he couldn’t recall his name, he was quite a powerful warrior among the Zojin race.
 </p>
 <p>
  But in the past life of Seong Jihan, he had been defeated several times.
 </p>
 <p>
  Later on, he always said, “I won’t fight you!” and fled into the sky whenever Seong Jihan appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should instill fear in him earlier than before.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Swooooosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Eclipse arose from Seong Jihan’s left arm,
 </p>
 <p>
  Fundamental Divine Art, Triad of Martial Mastery -Total Annihilation Horizontal Sweep
 </p>
 <p>
  “What…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The golden Zojin sensed the sword energy approaching and put up his spear for defense, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoooosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The spear shattered, along with his upper body, and fell to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “What the… ”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Under debuff… how could…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Zojin following behind him were instantly cut down as well, falling to the ground split at the waist.
 </p>
 <p>
  Doomed to die and log out with their bodies split in two by a single swing of Seong Jihan’s sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan annihilated five Zojin with one strike.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What incredible power…!’
 </p>
 <p>
  “Truly, they belong to the 4th rank race!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He’s no ordinary adversary. But we have no need to approach him, attack from a distance!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t get close!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Zojin Tribe was shocked at Seong Jihan’s single strike and became highly cautious, but
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s definitely weaker.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was not satisfied with his attack; he originally aimed to wipe out all the Zojin in the sky at once.
 </p>
 <p>
  The reach of the Horizontal Sweep fell short of reaching them.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But they pose no real threat.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though the enemy was buffed, and he was debuffed, the gap in actual strength was far too wide to be bridged.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Attack!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Hsssssst!
 </p>
 <p>
  The sky unleashed wind-based attack spells and arrows, aiming fiercely at him, but
 </p>
 <p>
  Sssssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  As Eclipse turned into a Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods, all the assaults were sucked in.
 </p>
 <p>
  One swirling wisp of dark energy resisted the entirety of the Zojin’s retaliation.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan put strength into his foot,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s end this quickly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle! Crackle!
 </p>
 <p>
  Electric current flowed beneath his foot, and instantly, his silhouette vanished from the spot.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where’s that human…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Here! Over here! Argh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>

 <p>
  For the Zojin, it was the beginning of a nightmare.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  “What, what is this guy…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The leader of the Zojin race narrowed his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clearly, according to the system message, it was the Pioneer Protection period.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, a member of the ‘Humanity’ race, currently ranked fourth, was ruthlessly cutting down his kin.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ki, Kiik!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That guy, he’s stronger than the elves…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He definitely received a buff doubling his attributes!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite being significantly empowered by the system’s buff,
 </p>
 <p>
  Every time the faceless human swung his sword, the Zojin were split in half and tumbled down helplessly.
 </p>
 <p>
  From 500 summoned, now fewer than 100 of their kin remained in the numbers.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Zojin First Guild members swiftly flew to their leader in desperation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Guild Master, we need to retreat…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If the leader gets caught, we’re immediately disqualified!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll try to hold them back!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Only one remained.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the humiliation of retreating from just one debuffed human,
 </p>
 <p>
  When considering the kin in the league crawling in last place, they had to endure the disgrace and survive.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Humanity… we’ll distance ourselves from this monstrous race and reclaim our territory! We must avoid finishing last!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Flap! Flap!
 </p>
 <p>
  The golden-winged Zojin hurriedly fled,
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, cries of their kin echoed continuously from behind him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pretending not to hear, he flew on earnestly until…
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzt!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As his golden wings were ripped off, the leader looked back with trembling eyes to see the faceless human race’s entity, wrapped in currents of red electricity, standing there.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, you’re the leader.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, not me!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who else could it be? Everyone else is dead.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Confounded by Seong Jihan’s words, the Zojin leader questioned,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the point of Eclipse trembled.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  His head fell from the sky to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Special achievement, ‘Early Elimination of Competitive Pioneers,’ achieved.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’ve acquired 1,000,000 achievement points.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Special achievement, ‘Early Extinction of Pioneers as a Sole Individual,’ achieved.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’ve acquired 3,000,000 achievement points.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite being in the Pioneer Protection period and single-handedly annihilating the enemy, an enormous amount of achievement points flowed in.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’ve acquired 3941 planet points.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’ve accumulated 100,000 planet points. No longer able to store more.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [To collect more planet points, you must build a base camp.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Now having reached the cap on Planet Points,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s time to build that Base Camp.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan finished his scouting in the north and was returning,
 </p>
 <p>
  -After watching today’s broadcast, I’m convinced. The Zojin Tribe is indeed the foundation for humanity’s worst rankings.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -They got sliced like nothing by Seong Jihan who couldn’t even use 30 percent of his strength. LOL
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers were assessing the newly encountered race, the Zojin Tribe.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But don’t underestimate their flight abilities. They’re not a weak race.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Imagine fighting them without Seong Jihan in the air, we’d be hopelessly played.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Well, they’re weaker than dragons or elves anyway, right?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -?? If you look, it’s not humanity that won lol.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -It’s not humanity that won, it’s Seong Jihan who won. Those two races…
 </p>
 <p>
  The Zojin Tribe, larger than humans and with wings enabling high-speed flight, seemed to be a stronger entity in BattleNet based on specs alone.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, due to their encounter with Seong Jihan, gathering objective data about them had become difficult.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Being too strong is also a problem lol. Can’t analyze the enemy.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -But I hope he stays strong.
 </p>
 <br/>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  -For real… No need to analyze. I just want Sir Seong Jihan to keep getting stronger until the end of the BattleNet.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -That’s it! Since he let our lowest race fly high… he has to take responsibility to the end, right??
 </p>
 <p>
  As the conclusion to rely on Seong Jihan formed amidst the ongoing analysis of the Zojin Tribe,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh. Uncle’s back!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan arrived in the human territory.
 </p>
 <p>
  Earlier on, people had scattered for reconnaissance, but soon they had all regrouped, sorted by their respective guilds.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why are you all gathered here? Weren’t you scouting?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh! We were also collecting points by fighting giant bugs… then, suddenly, we hit the 100,000 cap. We returned for now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  While exterminating the Zojin Tribe, the max Planet Points he acquired had likely applied to the entire race.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But I saw a message earlier. Didn’t the Zojin Tribe get wiped out?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right. Uncle, didn’t you just set out to scout the north?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s true. But then I saw the rival race. Took care of them along the way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We had trouble with just a few giant bugs, but uncle went and eradicated a whole race…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah! They seemed a bit weak. Likely to linger at the bottom.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nonchalantly rated the Zojin Tribe and walked towards the center of the human territory,
 </p>
 <p>
  where another message began to appear.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Will you construct the Base Camp?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [10,000 Planet Points are required.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The race ‘humanity’ has disqualified the rival race, ‘Zojin Tribe.’]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Investing another 10,000 Planet Points in the Base Camp will allow you to utilize the Zojin Tribe’s colonization feature ‘Skyborne’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Would you like to invest more Planet Points?]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Skyborne? Does it have something to do with flight ability?’ Since the Planet Points were at the max anyway,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to use them in humanity’s Base Camp.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he confirmed his choice,
 </p>
 <p>
  Rumble!
 </p>
 <p>
  The ground split, and soon a contemporary high-rise building emerged.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh. Here I thought we’d get something for the Base Camp…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow!! A building has been built!”
 </p>
 <p>
  And at the same time,
 </p>
 <p>
  The split ground transformed into a concrete surface.
 </p>
 <p>
  Between the desert planet, the hub of the urban area alone looked as if cut out from Earth’s downtown.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Skyborne attribute is activated.]
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the buildings embedded in the ground soon,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whooom…
 </p>
 <p>
  floated up, converting into a floating base camp.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Humanity’s territory expands even further.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Detecting native life forms and rival races becomes faster.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [It also becomes easier for rival races to locate the Base Camp.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Clearly advantageous and disadvantageous traits of the Zojin Tribe’s Skyborne attribute.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘In any case, expanding our territory is what matters.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan saw more benefit than detriment.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Now, what to build next?’
 </p>
 <p>
  80,000 Planet Points remained.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he pondered where to invest,
 </p>
 <p>
  -Customer~! The packaging of the bio-robots is complete! Shall I open the trading window?
 </p>
 <p>
  He received a message from Artemus.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Really? It’ll cost 100 billion GP, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  -That’s right! The bio-robots will greatly reduce the points needed for your race’s base camp construction. Collecting planet points is quite a headache… but they will significantly lessen the initial expenditure.
 </p>
 <p>
  -It was accumulating quickly though?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Even so, it’s only been an hour since the game started… You wouldn’t have been able to gather enough for a base camp yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  -No. I wiped out a race and hit the 100,000 MAX.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ridiculous… Is that even possible during the Pioneer Protection period?
 </p>
 <p>
  Artemus didn’t believe Seong Jihan’s message.
 </p>
 <p>
  -If they just reduce initial expenditures, I don’t need them, the bio-robots.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wa-wait a moment! Wait!
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan attempted to withdraw his intent to purchase, Artemus hastily intervened.
 </p>
 <p>
  -The usefulness of the bio-robots isn’t just limited to that! If the base camp really gets constructed as you say… Resource extraction! Automatic resource extraction is possible!
 </p>
 <p>
  -Resource extraction?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yes! The value of the resources obtained from the planet colonization map! That’s where we greatly evolved our dwarves!
 </p>
 <p>
  -Alright. Open the trading window.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although he was hesitant to buy if it was only for a discount on planet points, since there was utility in resource extraction, Seong Jihan decided to make the purchase.
 </p>
 <p>
  And so, the summoned bio-robot dwarves scattered around.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Resource obtained: ‘Seven Hearts of the Indigenous Species’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The vitality of the Human race is slightly enhanced.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  He received an entirely unexpected reward.

  Chapter 270
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘To think a being of the Constellation level would emerge here… Indeed, There’s no such thing as balance in BattleNet.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought this as he recalled his past life’s events while acknowledging the imbalance caused by BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Last time, they underestimated us, launching a surprise attack one day before the colonization ended.’
 </p>
 <p>
  During the two-week colonization period,
 </p>
 <p>
  humanity was achieving decent results in planeta colonization until they were ambushed by the World Tree Elves on the last day.
 </p>
 <p>
  Led by giants made of trees, the elves crushed humanity’s base camp in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  The World Tree Elves, who had already executed humanity’s players in the first match,
 </p>
 <p>
  continued to showcase their overwhelming might in planet colonization, cementing their position as humanity’s bane.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But I hadn’t encountered ancient Elves back then… Could it be that they’ve come because of me?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Ancient Elves, ranking elders of the World Tree Elf group, possess martial strength comparable to the Constellations.
 </p>
 <p>
  During the return process of the modified seeds of life in BattleNet, one threatened Seong Jihan not to hand over the seeds to the BattleNet system.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite his threats, Seong Jihan returned the seed of life, and the enraged elf considered invading Earth.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Earth was an “already experimented world,” making entry impossible, and the seed return was a done deal.
 </p>
 <p>
  Is it possible that because of that incident, the Constellation itself joined the Bronze League’s competition?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No, that can’t be it. A Constellation wouldn’t bother with such trivialities. He may have other purposes and saw me as an opportunity to settle the score.’
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  In reality, had the Constellations wanted to kill Seong Jihan, they wouldn’t bother threatening humanity but would immediately invade.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no reason to tell him to “enjoy the present ease.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Could it be that he had another task at hand?
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan pondered over the intentions of the Ancient Elf.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ancient Elf… His participation in planet colonization is surprising.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel spoke to him from his arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you know something about this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I don’t have information about Ancient Elves other than what Shadow Queen told me last time. However, I’ve heard that the World Tree Elves show great interest in planet colonization, likely due to unique resources found here.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you referring to benefits like the Seven Hearts humanity gained?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. Although the benefits of resources are marginal, they apply to the entire race instantaneously, which is significant even by BattleNet standards.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel continued after applauding the rarity of an entire race immediately receiving the benefits from a single item.
 </p>
 <p>
  [It was speculated that the elves’ persistent participation in the Bronze League was due to the resources of the ‘planet colonization’ map. But, it seems the speculation wasn’t entirely off, given Ancient Elf’s participation in planet colonization.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are there no planet colonization maps beyond the Bronze League?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [No, the planet colonization map is an exclusive benefit for beginners entering the Bronze League. Even Shadow Queen regretted not acquiring more resources from the planet colonization map.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, really? Did you enter the Hall of Fame, too?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Hall of Fame… I think we ranked 100th.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “100th? 100 is where Artemus ranks right now. Looks like you were outranked by him.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [What? He took the 100th place?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel seemed to hint that Shadow Queen’s faction had previously been in the 100th spot before Artemus’s rise in rankings.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Even after we subjugated this pioneering continent on the sixth day and continued to collect resources, to be outdone by Artemus who operates the game alone is unbelievable.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s tough to be kicked out of the top 100 of the Hall of Fame. The hurdle is high.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [After all, it’s a game challenged by innumerably many races across the universe. The top 100 is a significant feat.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Any useful tips for planet colonization from your side?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Special tips? We went for the research facility enhancement route.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Research facility?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [As you build buildings, you’ll see that apart from the basic structures, many derivative buildings become available. The research facilities improve the quality of the resources you collect. However, the path we and you will take must be different.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [We don’t gain vitality from ‘Native Species’ Seven Hearts,’ but your race does, right?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded at that.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, there’s a difference in resource efficiency between the lowest-tier and upper-mid-tier races?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Exactly. For your race, quantity may be more critical than quality. A route focusing on resource management might be better.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thanks for the tip. But to know all this… are you sure you’re not the queen?”
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  [This again? How could the queen be so free to reside within an arm like this? I only know because I’ve been observing the whole process.]
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, Ariel retreated back into Seong Jihan’s arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Leader’s authority.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ding!
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, before Seong Jihan, a window appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Authority granted to the leader after the construction of the base camp, which gave the right to construct buildings through Planet Points.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I wasn’t sure what to construct, but Ariel’s tip has given me direction.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Within the authority window, various constructions were listed, specialized for defense, attack, reconnaissance, and others like research facilities and resource management offices.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to heavily invest in the resource management office.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Would you like to add the skyborne ability of the Zojin race to the Resource Management Office?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [10,000 Planet Points are needed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Add it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Rrrrrumble!
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, as the ground split open, a modern building rose, soon the whole structure floated into the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan didn’t only add the skyborne ability to the Resource Management Office but also to all buildings under construction.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a considerable expense of Planet Points, but
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The secondary effects are worth using.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [The territory of the ‘human’ race is further expanded by the skyborne trait.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Territorial expansion was basic,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Resource collector ’22nd Generation Evolutionary Bio-robot Dwarf’ is granted flight ability.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Resource collection capacity increases by 100 percent, and all players’ movement speed is accelerated.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Each building was granted additional characteristics.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan developed buildings towards the resource management office,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Planet Points have run out. Time to harvest more.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He turned his gaze southward.
 </p>
 <p>
  After Je Galheon and Players of People’s Association were beheaded and died, all human players had retreated temporarily.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘As long as the Ancient Elf doesn’t directly intervene, World Tree Elves are manageable. I should go. It would also serve as a reconnaissance mission.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If the Ancient Elf showed up and overpowered Seong Jihan, then the game would be lost,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He’s an elf trying to invade Earth to kill me. If he was going to kill me, he would’ve already invaded.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, considering that the ancient elf was only attempting to intimidate and not take action, decided to venture south himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Other players, please scout primarily the east, west, and north.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mr. Seong Jihan… Are you intending to go south?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “General Je Galheon logged out after he advised strictly against going south due to the monster-like World Tree Elves.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, someone has to deal with those monsters.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Wouldn’t it be safer to stay put until resource collection time? If Mr. Seong Jihan dies, planetary colonization ends here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Could you please wait until we buy more dwarf biobots…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the animosity between the American First Players and the People’s Association Players, they were united in discouraging Seong Jihan’s southern advance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan could guess why they were behaving like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Having experienced vitality, they must be excited.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The most important thing for wealthy individuals who have achieved much was health.
 </p>
 <p>
  From their perspective, resource collection was more crucial than scouting the situation in the south.
 </p>
 <p>
  But
 </p>
 <p>
  “Artemus hasn’t contacted me yet. I’ll be back soon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  For Seong Jihan, entering the ‘Hall of Fame’ was more important than resources,
 </p>
 <p>
  and the biggest obstacle was the World Tree Elves in the south.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was ready to take on their worries and head southward when—
 </p>
 <p>
  -Customer! Big trouble. Huge trouble!
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment, an urgent message from Artemus arrived.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Artemus, who said he would check the forge and report back as it was shaking, started sending a stream of messages to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  -The forge was acting strange… There’s a red lion!
 </p>
 <p>
  -It feels familiar. It’s made of red lightning you use!
 </p>
 <p>
  -So I asked who it was. Know what it replied?
 </p>
 <p>
  -‘I am the Thunder God! Thunder God! One of the gods, famous for its immense power!’
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  ‘Red lion? The leader of the Thunder Gods, Brahma, who absorbed crimson thunder? He’s there?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s eyes shone upon reading Artemus’s message.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Thunder God which had disintegrated after losing to the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  Recently, even the ‘Brahma’ title vanished from Seong Jihan’s Constellation Slots, making it seem like it had met its true demise.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the leader of the Brahmas seemed to have somehow survived.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But really, he kept asking about your whereabouts… What have you done to offend the Thunder God?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Offend? It was a transaction.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Hmm. Anyway… Can you come to me now?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why? I’m in the middle of planet colonization. I don’t have time.
 </p>
 <p>
  -It’ll only take a moment! Just a moment! I’ll give you ten more new-model bio-robots!
 </p>
 <p>
  -New models?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, while doubting the desperate message from Artemus—
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is the Thunder God threatening you to bring me there?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Um, well, it’s not exactly a threat… It just really wants to see you and have a conversation.
 </p>
 <p>
  -If it has something to say, it can message. Don’t bother me with your busybody.
 </p>
 <p>
  -…To be honest, if you don’t come, it’s threatening to blow up my forge.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Blow up the forge…? That’s not good.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Right? So will you come?
 </p>
 <p>
  -No. If something goes wrong, I won’t be able to return to Earth.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it was just a game, maybe. But in reality, if he went there and some conflict caused an explosion in Artemus’s forge, he’d be stranded as a space orphan.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t worth the risk.
 </p>
 <p>
  -I’d ensure your return, there’s no need to worry about that!
 </p>
 <p>
  -Let it be. I won’t come. Contact me when you’ve packed the bio-robots.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wait…! Right, I won’t sell the robots then!
 </p>
 <p>
  -Do as you please. If you don’t sell, you’ll lose.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh, please…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite Artemus’s continued pleas to save him, Seong Jihan ignored all those messages.
 </p>
 <p>
  It made no sense to risk being unable to return just to save Artemus.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Seems like the additional bio-robots are out of reach now. I should catch some elves instead.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Ignoring the messages, Seong Jihan proceeded south,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why… Why can’t I log out? Only my head is left…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aaaah…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please… kill me…”
 </p>
 <p>
  He advanced towards the screams of Earth’s players.
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon arriving, he saw three identical elves, applying something to the necks of 10 human players they had beheaded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wasting World Tree sap on these beings… Such a waste.”CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yet it must be done. Our ancestors deemed it necessary.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “To find use for a detestable race like this… Our ancestors are indeed great.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How can these weaklings rank 4th?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The High elves, sporting their distinctive green hair, had effortlessly incapacitated humanity’s top players, taunting them as they chatted.
 </p>
 <p>
  Noticing Seong Jihan’s arrival, their gaze quickly shifted.
 </p>
 <p>
  Initially calm,
 </p>
 <p>
  “This presence…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can sense Life force from him!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s amassed vitality perhaps contributed to the High Elves’ agitation.
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s a fake. Kill them and leave the heads.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Following the voice from above by the Ancient Elf,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t be swayed, heed the Ancestor’s command!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Follow the orders! Leave only the neck!”
 </p>
 <p>
  They simultaneously lifted their wooden swords, darting towards Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Their speed was incomparably faster than when they faced the other human players,
 </p>
 <p>
  but Seong Jihan—
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘High Elves… This should earn me some points.’
 </p>
 <p>
  —smilingly grasped his sword, ready to face the new challengers.

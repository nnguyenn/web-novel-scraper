  Chapter 272
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s fascinating. To be able to log back into the game like this…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The temporary space prepared by the Thunder God, Brahma.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, accepting Artemus’s proposal, entered this location. Despite being busy with planet colonization,
 </p>
 <p>
  -Please… if it continues this way, my forge will be completely destroyed! I won’t be able to make a comeback! The glory of the dwarf tribe will turn to bubbles.
 </p>
 <p>
  -That’s truly unfortunate.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yes, right. You’re doing planet colonization… This time I’ll provide you with the latest and efficient biobot models. Of course, for free! And I’ll add three more forge usage vouchers.
 </p>
 <p>
  -We’ll see.
 </p>
 <p>
  After Artemus offered several incentives and pleaded for a moment of his time, Seong Jihan ultimately accepted the proposal.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You are currently participating as the ‘leader’ in the league competition ‘planet colonization.’ If you do not log back in within 2 hours, humanity will be disqualified.]
 </p>
 <p>
  In the game within the league competition, upon being summoned to another space, a system message popped up urging him to log back in quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  While non-leader players were free to log out, leaders were central to planet colonization and therefore had a 2-hour restriction.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll just listen to the story and leave.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought this as he looked around.
 </p>
 <p>
  A space similar to where the Brahma’s Throne was located, although the most important throne itself was absent.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzzz…
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’re here…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  At the center of the summoned space, a current of red electricity flowed, revealing the figure of the red lion.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite its immense size, the leader of the thunder gods appeared riddled with holes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan gazed at it before speaking.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your body is in tatters, Brahma.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Martial God’s disciples pursued me fiercely. Especially Dongbang Sak, he was incredibly powerful…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why is the Martial God’s disciples tribe after you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Probably because of the crimson thunder. The Martial God absorbed all of the Thunder God’s powers except for that one.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Haven’t you absorbed the crimson thunder yet?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s why they are chasing me so madly…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan tilted his head, finding it peculiar.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had thought it strange that the Martial God hadn’t absorbed the crimson thunder during their last encounter, and now even after possessing the Brahma’s throne, it still hadn’t been absorbed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Maybe Dongbang sak’s imparted Crimson Divine Art wasn’t mastered either.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If he hasn’t acquired Crimson Divine Art,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan could speculate that the Martial God hadn’t been able to replicate powers associated with him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well then, what is it you want from me? I only have 2 hours, so be quick.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Retrieve the crimson thunder you gave me.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You want me to take it back? After you gave me an EX-grade skill for the crimson thunder?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes… I don’t need it anymore.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The leader of the thunder gods spoke wearily.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Survival comes first. I will eventually be caught by the Martial God’s disciples. It’s better not to possess the crimson thunder, which they are targeting.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t mind, but doesn’t that mean you’ll perish?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Originally, to stand against the Martial God, he had accepted the crimson thunder to exist as an independent concept.
 </p>
 <p>
  But what would all his actions amount to if he now gave up the crimson thunder?
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Brahma dismissed that question with a shake of his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I’ve managed to escape, for now. My primary objective, at any rate, was successful. As the leader of the thunder gods, I am not bound to the Divine throne until death.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then why don’t you just give up the crimson thunder? Is there really a need to pass it on to me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Since I’ve become one with it, I can’t separate it myself. You, as the source, must take it back.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hm…”
 </p>
 <p>
  This offer isn’t bad at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought so.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thunder God held powerful energy within the crimson thunder
 </p>
 <p>
  Successfully absorbing it would greatly enhance the power of his Lightning attribute.
 </p>
 <p>
  But,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There might be underlying intentions. I should be prepared.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan did not completely trust the words of Brahma.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it were such an advantageous proposal for Seong Jihan, Artemus wouldn’t have bothered with the threats on his spaceship.
 </p>
 <p>
  And Artemus, who was quietly listening nearby, interjected with a comment about the proposal.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Taking the Crimson thunder back sounds good… but can the customer handle it? Absorbing the power of the Thunder God is no small feat.]
 </p>

 <p>
  [You’re talking nonsense. He’s the originator, so he can handle it however he wants.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [But…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stay out of this, third party.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the leader of the Thunder God discharged currents towards Artemus, he fell silent.
 </p>
 <p>
  [What will you do? Will you take it? If you accept it, when I become the constellation again, you’ll be richly rewarded.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “How can you become that again if you perish?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Even though the Thunder God constellation has vanished for now, it will eventually reappear. The concept of venerating the heavens’ lightning as a divine power won’t disappear. In the meantime, I will exist as a lightning spirit, waiting for the opportunity. If I survive, chances will undoubtedly come…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if the divine throne was taken away and the collective of the Thunder God was annihilated, the concept of the Thunder God didn’t disappear, so it could resurrect again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan carefully listened before retorting.
 </p>
 <p>
  “When will that ‘someday’ be?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That is…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I want something I can receive right now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Aren’t you taking the crimson thunder?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, I’m also taking on the risk. How can a human like me safely reabsorb divine thunder? There must be compensation for such a risk.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Really… this tiresome being! Why so many demands?! Even after seeing my current state, you want to take more from me!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m not in a leisure situation either.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In order to counter the Martial God, Seong Jihan had to become stronger by any means necessary.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if dealing with a fleeing leader of the Thunder God, he was not so free as to be charitable.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Gah… I’ll give 1 trillion.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “1 trillion GP?”
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  [Yes…! Be satisfied with this amount. I can’t give more than this. I need to recover after passing the Crimson Thunder!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm. Anything else besides GP? Like skills or items?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [None. There’s none!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if he received GP, Seong Jihan didn’t have much use for it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s all just piling up money.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan smacked his lips and nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Fine. I’ll take the GP, and then retrieve the crimson thunder.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hah. Much appreciated.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Having thriftily extracted even the GP,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now, I’ll take it back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He absorbed the crimson thunder from Brahma.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a 2-hour limitation, he initially wondered if he had to go back and forth,
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzzz…
 </p>
 <p>
  The body of the red lion, full of holes, shrank rapidly,
 </p>
 <p>
  and the crimson thunder was absorbed by Seong Jihan in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The rare stat ‘Thunder Seal’ has been replaced with the unique stat ‘Crimson Thunder’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The value of the Crimson Thunder stat has reached 200, reaching the player’s limit.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The remaining Crimson Thunder will remain in the body and will be reabsorbed when the stat limit increases.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Crimson Thunder is separated into stats… and 200 is the limit?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Crimson Thunder, previously almost bound to the void, was now branded on Seong Jihan’s hand after taking it back from Brahma, replacing the ‘Thunder Seal’ stat.
 </p>
 <p>
  And,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssshh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The formidable presence of the red lion deflated like a balloon,
 </p>
 <p>
  shrinking to a size similar to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  […It’s done. Now I shall retreat again.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  With those final words, the leader of the thunder gods vanished.
 </p>
 <p>
  Simultaneously, a message appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The world will close in 1 minute. Prepare to logout.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The transfer of the crimson thunder from the Thunder God was neatly concluded within two hours.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking at the results, it was a transaction filled only with gains for Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Apart from receiving money and crimson thunder from the Thunder God,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hey, um, After receiving 1 trillion GP… could you possibly invest in our forge? The Thunder God wrecked it even more……]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, send over some more new bio-robots. Offer them at a reasonable price.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Of course! I’ll go pack them right away!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll also give you the Dragon Heart later.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Definitely!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Since Seong Jihan was able to obtain more resource-gathering robots from Artemus, he was quite satisfied. However, just before logging out…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s face grew cold as he examined the crimson thnder flowing within him.
 </p>

 <p>
  Although the part of the current absorbed into the stats was under his control,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The movement is subtle.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was irritatingly tickling his senses.
 </p>
 <p>

  = The planet colonization has already reached its 13th day!
 </p>
 <p>
  = Ah, it’s coming to an end now. Truly regrettable! We’ve gained a lot during this time, haven’t we?
 </p>
 <p>
  = Indeed. When Seong Jihan restocked the bio-robots, the entire Earth cheered!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the planet colonization was nearing its end, humanity was in a celebratory mood.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Already ending? That’s too bad…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Seriously, these few days of benefits feel more significant than years of training.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Still, the vitality increase hasn’t been that much lately. It seems like there’s been more focus on player abilities, right?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Yeah, these past few days, there’s been a huge increase in gift appearance rates.
 </p>
 <p>
  Life vitality resources haven’t been appearing as much after a certain point, but instead, resources directly related to BattleNet activities, like increased gift appearance rates, GP exchange rate boosts, and experience point boosts, were becoming more prevalent.
 </p>
 <p>
  While regular folks lamented the scarcity of these resources,
 </p>
 <p>
  -In comparison with other races, humanity’s level is too low.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -It’s not good to keep relying on Seong Jihan alone.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Eventually, if more people get gifts, won’t the players’ levels go up? This should be welcomed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Those with even a slight interest in BattleNet welcomed them as a means to enhance humanity’s overall power.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, at humanity’s base camp,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh… I want to rest. I want to sleep, I want to bathe.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah lamented with utter exhaustion.
 </p>
 <p>
  Day 13 of planet colonization.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah had not logged out once, catching little sleep within the game, and continuously hunting indigenous species.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your face looks clean, though?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sophia used a cleansing magic spell on me… Her divine power flashes and cleans the body. I appreciate it, but I wish for a bath to soak in, not just magic.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why not just log out for a while and take a break?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can’t. I need to stay within the top 50.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The BattleNet Association will award hefty prizes to players in the top 50, sponsored by major guilds.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why does a Sword Palace landlord care about prize money?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not just about money; it’s about honor! And they said they’ll give items too!”
 </p>
 <p>
  To employ the bio-robots, Dwarves had to capture indigenous creatures, a task that required human players to eliminate them. To motivate human players participating in planet colonization, Earth leaders offered substantial prizes and SS-grade items along with the prize money, creating a fierce competition.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, what rank are you in?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Me? 25th. Haha… I’m going to push into the top 10. But what about the Elves? They’ve been invisible since the 10th day.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right, They’ve completely disappeared.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They’re still earning points every day, though. They might be at sea.”Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  Elf remnants vanished after day 10.
 </p>
 <p>
  But they weren’t annihilated, still earning planet points daily in the ranking competition.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although their numbers paled compared to humanity, who controlled the colonization game,
 </p>
 <p>
  Elves earned not insignificant Points.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even after searching near the coast, I found nothing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where could they have gone? Aren’t they planning something big on the last day?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I wonder…”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan conversed with Yoon Seah, a message arrived from a player scattered across the area for hunting…
 </p>
 <p>
  -S-Seong Jihan! Here, on the east coast… something’s not right. The seawater is shooting up into the sky!
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not the last day, but the day before that they’re causing trouble.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan rose from his seat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll be back in a bit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll go check it out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What… what’s happening?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzzzzz!
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan summoned all the Crimson Thunder, now fully under his control with a stat of 200, there was still a lingering buffer in his body.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even after several days, the power remained beyond his complete control.
 </p>
 <p>
  Given the power reliant on his soul, it was indeed daunting.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Thunder God wouldn’t have just given it back for no reason. Still…there’s a place to utilize it all.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With a meaningful smile, he headed eastward.

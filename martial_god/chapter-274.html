  Chapter 274
 </p>
 <p>
  A little while ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So he’s of Constellation rank, huh? Powerful indeed. At this rate, I’ll be defeated without a chance.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was being overwhelmingly outmatched by Ancient Elf, and he started thinking of a way to turn the tide.
 </p>
 <p>
  Numerous martial arts techniques flashed through his mind, but then,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll use the Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit.’
 </p>
 <p>
  His choice fell on the Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit, a technique he got a hint of during his recent fight with the High Elves.
 </p>
 <p>
  Normal strategies were ineffective,
 </p>
 <p>
  And the rest of his lethal techniques were not suitable to use in this situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Even if it costs all my life force, I must use it to its extreme.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit, which forms chains by destroying life force within.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was determined to use everything he had against the Ancient Elf.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he was about to use his life force as fuel for the Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Hmm?’Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  While channeling all his force, he discovered that the Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit was reacting unexpectedly in a certain area.
 </p>
 <p>
  Normally, it requires destroying one’s life force to activate.
 </p>
 <p>
  Oddly, it started to take root in the crimson thunder he hadn’t absorbed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s fine with the crimson thunder included in my stats. It’s just the unabsorbed part that’s reacting this way…’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It seems the residual thunder not included in the stat ‘Crimson Thunder’ are reacting strangely…,’ Seong Jihan mused.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this critical moment, this power began to emit an even stronger lightning force.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Did Brahma play a trick on me?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, this massive electricity wasn’t given to him for nothing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Recalling his previous experience using the Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit against a golem, Seong Jihan decided to employ it once more, this time utilizing the residual crimson thunder as fuel for the technique. The Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit, which typically required the destruction of his life force, could potentially be powered by these currents instead.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This might work out well,’ Seong Jihan thought. With determination, he began preparing the Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit while focusing on utilizing the residual crimson thunder as its fuel.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan resolved and slowly prepared for the lethal technique.
 </p>
 <p>
  [No, no! My power… my power is disappearing!]
 </p>
 <p>
  He managed to create a chain manifestation of Brahma’s avatar.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Using your life force as fuel is much better than my own life force. What’s the difference, I wonder?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Agh… What are you talking about…? How can you dismantle my power like this?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who knows. I don’t either.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssshhh!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the red lion’s form completely vanished and the chains of thunder flew towards the Ancient Elf, Seong Jihan couldn’t help but feel satisfied with his decision. The residual crimson thunder, which had remained a nuisance, now became the perfect fuel for the Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit.
 </p>
 <p>
  The remaining residual crimson thunder within Seong Jihan’s body also turned into chains and bound the Ancient Elf. The Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit technique completely transformed the Thunder God’s force.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Please, stop! Just spare my life! I’ll become your servant!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Feeling fear at the prospect of complete transformation, the Brahma pleaded with Seong Jihan, asking him to reconsider.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Use formal speech.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […What?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you’re going to be a servant, use formal speech. Remember what you said earlier?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Zap!
 </p>
 <p>
  At those words, lightning within Seong Jihan surged.
 </p>
 <p>
  But that was only for a moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Please, I beg you. I’ll become your servant!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The red lion, which had escaped from the Thunder God’s leadership position, appealed desperately to Seong Jihan, unable to let go of its attachment to life.
 </p>
 <p>
  In response, Seong Jihan chuckled and intensified the Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit technique.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Brahma, How could you use formal speech when you are a god? How did you even become a god in the first place? I don’t need a servant like you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You brat…! I’ll kill you. I will definitely kill you…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do as you please.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssshhh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The chains of lightning sprang forth even faster from Seong Jihan’s body, completely binding the Ancient Elf. Despite his attempts to absorb the bound energy, the Ancient Elf couldn’t resist for long.
 </p>
 <p>
  Zap…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike before, the surface of his mask now emitted crimson currents, indicating a significant change.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Unbelievable. How can you transform a god into chains and manifest the roots of Yggdrasil…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The roots of Yggdrasil? What’s that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Asking what it is after wrapping my body with it…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I really don’t know.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack!
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as he finished speaking,
 </p>
 <p>
  The crimson chains pressed down on Ancient Elf’s entire body.
 </p>
 <p>
  His flesh burned and regenerated in a cycle, barely holding on.
 </p>
 <p>
  But soon, even that resistance was futile.
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  ‘Oh? This is…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The chains absorbed a vast amount of life force, flowing into Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Did the Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit’s chains also have a life force-absorbing fability?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What exactly is the Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Initially possessing the regenerative ability of elves,
 </p>
 <p>
  This martial art, which transforms life force into chains to bind the opponent, seemed complex.
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering it was the final technique of the Annihilation series,
 </p>
 <p>
  It was incomparably complex compared to other techniques.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Anyway, absorbing life force is useful.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Though not all of the Ancient Elf’s power was absorbed by the Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit,
 </p>
 <p>
  Even a part of it was a great help to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack! Crack!
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan absorbed more life force,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ancient Elf’s body could no longer withstand the chains.
 </p>
 <p>
  One by one, his flesh burst open.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…So this is the end.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Ancient Elf, who had threatened to take only Seong Jihan’s neck, found himself bound by chains, leaving only his neck free.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I admit defeat this time. So release your power.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Release the chains. Let’s consider this matter settled.”
 </p>
 <p>
  And the Ancient Elf, with only his neck remaining, casually requested Seong Jihan to release him.
 </p>
 <p>
  -??
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -What’s he saying?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Is he insane?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -He was all about taking Seong Jihan with him, but now he’s asking to be released? LOL
 </p>
 <p>
  In response to the Ancient Elf’s blatant request to be released, viewers showed incredulous reactions.
 </p>
 <p>
  They couldn’t understand why the Ancient Elf was demanding freedom now after deciding to take Seong Jihan for experimentation just a few minutes ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  Wasn’t this completely utterly shameless?
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, the Ancient Elf remained confident.
 </p>
 <p>
  I don’t mind dying anyway. I’ve suffered this humiliation from a lower race like you. When I return, I’ll hand over my mask to my successor and be prepared to die.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, is that so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “However, if this mask breaks… even you will have difficulty dealing with the aftermath.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s almost broken already, isn’t it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The half-mask, soaked in lightning, was almost completely cracked.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘From the cracked areas, a strong void force is flowing.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan could feel it wasn’t just a bluff.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the cracks, if it broke, chaos would ensue.
 </p>
 <p>
  But,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can’t just release him because of that.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssshhh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit’s chains wrapped around Ancient Elf’s head completely.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re hastening your death.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Talking like that makes me more curious about what will happen if it breaks. I still have to achieve killing the constellation thing”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Killing the constellation?… Haha. Hanging onto such trivial things. Indeed, you’re a lower race… Fine. Do as you wish.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Ancient Elf sneered,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded and tightened the chains.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, with a jarring sound, the mask turned black and exploded outward.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  Pushing back the chains, a purple vortex appeared in its place.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the same time, a void explosion spread.
 </p>
 <p>
  =I can’t see the screen!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  =Did breaking the elf’s mask cause this?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  =I’m worried about player Seong Jihan…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Not only the commentator but also the viewers watching Seong Jihan’s personal channel were only able to see the purple screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  The entire world, once filled with sky, land, sun, and sea, was now consumed by the purple void.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the blink of an eye, the world had disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…To think such a void force was hidden within that small half-mask.’
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  The void force sealed within the half-mask, as the Ancient Elf described, was an enormous quantity.
 </p>
 <p>
  But,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Why am I fine?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, buried in the void force, remained unscathed, standing there blinking.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Why can’t they be controlled again…?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssshhh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The chains of the Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit, spreading in all directions, even as they turned purple in the void, did not lose their strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your ‘Void’ stat increases by 1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead, absorbing the void in the atmosphere, the chains boosted Seong Jihan’s stats.
 </p>
 <p>
  Initially, Seong Jihan welcomed the free stat increase,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your ‘Void’ stat increases by 3.]
 </p>
 <p>
  But as the void continued to rise, he frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s good that my stats are increasing, but it should be within a manageable limit.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Too many points in the void stat could engulf a player.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan pondered how to dispose of the chains,
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have eliminated an entity that defies the natural order.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have destroyed a seal created by the ‘Green Administrator’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your ‘Void Enforcer’ title is upgraded to ‘Void Executor’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The message of a title upgrade appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, At the star of martial god, Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This won’t do…]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God, having battled Brahma and absorbed power from the Brahma’s Throne, had not seen Seong Jihan’s accomplishments because of his focus on absorbing power.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing Seong Jihan killing Ancient Elf on the planet colonization map,
 </p>
 <p>
  He made a decision.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I’ll absorb him immediately.]
 </p>
 <p>
  At first, Seong Jihan was not considered a variable, but since seeing a future where Seong Jihan defeated him, Martial God began to find him bothersome. And the display of power today only strengthened his conviction that he needed to deal with Seong Jihan now.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If left alone, he’ll become a significant variable… a threat to my great plans. Before that happens, I’ll consume him.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  He extended a finger, drawing a rectangle.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, from it,
 </p>
 <p>
  A screen identical to what he was watching appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he inserted his finger into it,
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzzzz!
 </p>
 <p>
  [This is a league competition map.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [External access is prohibited.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A warning message from BattleNet appeared before his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  However…
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish, swish…!
 </p>
 <p>
  As if expecting this, Martial God casually drew letters over the warning message.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Access is permitted.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The message quickly changed to ‘permitted’.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Now, you’re worth absorbing more…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzzzz!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Wandering Martial God spoke calmly and reached into the screen,
 </p>
 <p>
  Rumble!
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, the land of Tuseong shook violently,
 </p>
 <p>
  Even the Brahma’s Throne where he sat trembled intensely.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  [Access is prohibited.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the earthquake occurred, the system message once again prohibited access.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God withdrew his finger, standing up from his seat.
 </p>
 <p>
  […Is that all it took to wake him up? Gilgamesh?]
 </p>
 <p>
  His gaze turned northward.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Now that he’s awake, I can’t directly intervene.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was unfortunate that he had awakened just before removing that variable.
 </p>
 <p>
  The timing couldn’t be worse.
 </p>
 <p>
  Martial God watched the north for a while before slowly speaking.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Longinus. Your master commands. Rise.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Longinus, who had been restoring his powers after destroying the Thunder God.
 </p>
 <p>
  Martial God awakened him and gave him orders.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Use the Spear of Judgement, and kill Seong Jihan.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, after a short silence, Longinus’ response came back.
 </p>
 <p>
  […Understood, Master.]

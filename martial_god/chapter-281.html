  Chapter 281
 </p>
 <p>
  The next morning,
 </p>
 <p>
  “…So that’s what happened.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin told Seong Jihan about the sponsorship message he received from the constellation last night.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The constellation’s sponsorship condition is to have a conversation with me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. He specifically mentioned you, so I didn’t select yes or no in the message window and left it on hold.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Primordial King…”
 </p>
 <p>
  A suddenly appearing constellation, The Primordial King.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan didn’t know why he wanted to talk to him specifically but,
 </p>
 <p>
  “If having conversation is burdensome, I will just select no.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Yoon Sejin’s words, he readily replied,
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, talking is not difficult. But I’m not sure if that constellation will be of help to you, brother-in-law.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really? Actually, my sponsored constellation slot has been empty for a long time. I’d like to receive support if possible. I feel like my growth has been too slow lately.”
 </p>
 <p>
  During this Abyss incident,
 </p>
 <p>
  Until Seong Jihan took action, he couldn’t do anything, perhaps that had an effect on him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin expressed his will to receive sponsorship from the The Primordial King if Seong Jihan was okay with it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then let’s have a talk now. I was curious about the existence of The Primordial King too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Yoon Sejin pressed yes at Seong Jihan’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  A golden light spread brightly in his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You are Seong Jihan?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Dad?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, who was watching their conversation from the side, responded like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin with golden eyes quietly spoke to her.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Child. I need to have an important conversation with him, so step out for a moment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At those words, Yoon Seah nodded her head blankly and went into her room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at Yoon Sejin with coldly sunken eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It doesn’t seem to be my brother-in-law… Is it the constellation? What did you do to Seah?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huhu. I merely commanded her to leave as the king of humans. Humanity must listen to my words.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “King of humans…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. I am Gilgamesh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh, who entered Yoon Sejin’s body, sat on the sofa and crossed his legs.
 </p>
 <p>
  Tap!
 </p>
 <p>
  And when he snapped his fingers, a golden barrier appeared around the living room.
 </p>
 <p>
  It cut off the outside and the inside space.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. And I am the last disciple of the Wandering Martial God, the first among the chosen.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You are?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan had heard in advance from Pythia, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  He pretended not to know and looked at him with a surprised face.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re not very surprised. It’s as if you already knew.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh smiled and saw through that his reaction was not sincere.
 </p>
 <p>
  At this rate, the question of how he knew would come out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan opened his mouth with a composed face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Actually, I saw the name Gilgamesh not long ago. In the Abyss.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “In the Abyss?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Class 1 Surveillance Target – Gilgamesh’ has been detected, Dispatching the Seven-Colored Celestial Bull, it said.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Level 1… The Void Faction. They’re still keeping an eye on me after all. You’ve benefited from it here too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Here too?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. You used The Martial God’s power to awaken me, didn’t you? The time for me to rise was right before humanity’s extinction. But you became a big variable.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh looked at Seong Jihan with satisfaction.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I hope you remain a variable.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But The Martial God thinks differently. He is someone who does not tolerate even small variables. You have exceeded the limit he can allow. He ordered Longinus to kill you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Longinus… Can constellations descend to Earth so easily?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The rules of BattleNet seem absolute, but there are always cracks to squeeze through. Until you become a constellation candidate, Martial God will continue to target you even at the cost of any losses. But if you survive Longinus’ hand, you will be able to guarantee your safety after that. Martial God has temporarily closed his eyes for now. And I am overseeing the affairs of Tuseong instead.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you are overseeing it, can’t you block Longinus’ intervention too?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s impossible. Orders given by Martial God before he closed his eyes must be carried out. However,”
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  A screen appeared before Seong Jihan’s eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can help you from behind like this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  On the screen, the chains that appeared when using the Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit seemed to spread to the sky and earth, then gathered back to their original position.
 </p>
 <p>
  And
 </p>
 <p>
  [Enkidu.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [TL/N: Enkidu was a legendary figure in ancient Mesopotamian mythology, wartime comrade and friend of Gilgamesh, king of Uruk.]
 </p>
 <p>
  When Gilgamesh spoke Enkidu on the screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clank! Clank!
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  The steel chains gathered in one place and transformed into a single form.
 </p>
 <p>
  Two arms and two legs formed, and a giant clad in huge steel armor with a head popping out.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is the created divine body, Enkidu. The spear of judgement aims for god’s first, so Enkidu can block his offensive. You not only awakened me, but also repelled the Celestial Bull in my stead. As a reward, I’ll teach you how to summon Enkidu.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Enkidu…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Will you learn it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s no harm in learning it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  Light burst from the screen he had displayed, and a new way to utilize the Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit began to be conveyed to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  The information the light conveyed was so vast that Seong Jihan unknowingly frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Indeed, you are one with a Martial Soul body.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh looked at Seong Jihan, who merely frowned, with a satisfied nod.
 </p>
 <p>
  After some time passed.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan returned to his original expression, Gilgamesh opened his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, did you understand it a bit?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Roughly. Of course, I’ll have to keep practicing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s fortunate. Then, I wish you luck. Survive from Longinus’ hand.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swooosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  As the golden light disappeared from the eyes of Yoon Sejin where Gilgamesh had descended.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hm?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Enkidu you taught me… What does it have to do with elves?”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s question, Gilgamesh looked at him with a very surprised expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…You deduced the relevance to elves from that information?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Enkidu’s body is similar to the inside of elves.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The interior of the steel giant Gilgamesh taught was similar to the elves Seong Jihan had cut and analyzed countless times.
 </p>
 <p>
  Enkidu, who only wore armor on the outside, but had a structure similar to a ‘Golem’ with super-regenerative abilities on the inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…To truly ‘understand’ it. You are more outstanding than expected. I am satisfied that your chances of surviving have increased. But I cannot answer your question. That is related to the ‘beginning’.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The beginning… Were there elves at that time?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That is too something I cannot answer.”
 </p>
 <p>
  But Gilgamesh still nodded his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  Is this an affirmative meaning?
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan thought so.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Any more is too much. Then, as I said again, survive from Longinus’ hand.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  As the light completely disappeared, Yoon Sejin’s eyes returned to their original black color.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh. Hmm. Jihan, Did a constellation just descend now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. I had a conversation with him.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…How was it? It wasn’t a conversation that harmed you, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As if he didn’t remember the conversation when Gilgamesh possessed him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin looked at Seong Jihan with worried eyes, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Harm me? No, It was a satisfactory conversation. I received something from him too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Seong Jihan couldn’t fully understand Gilgamesh’s intentions.
 </p>
 <p>
  The attitude he outwardly showed this time was favorable to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  On top of that, in order to survive from Longinus’ hand, he taught the utilization method of Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit and even summoning Enkidu.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin’s sponsored constellation ended up sponsoring Seong Jihan even more.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Rather, you, Brother-in-law, should get something from the constellation too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… The constellation was satisfied with this conversation and gave me 5 additional stats. And he even bestowed a blessing called the Primordial Blessing that further increases growth bonuses.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan said it was fine, Yoon Sejin talked about what he received with relief.
 </p>
 <p>
  The rewards he got were not bad either, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Somehow I feel sorry that I received more.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought so while looking at Yoon Sejin who was smiling with satisfaction after receiving this reward.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment,
 </p>
 <p>
  Click!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah. Uncle! What was that earlier?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The door to Yoon Seah’s room opened, and Yoon Seah, who had obediently gone in according to Gilgamesh’s words, came running out.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you in your right mind now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh… I was totally out of it. When Dad with golden eyes spoke, I had no choice but to follow his orders.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You couldn’t resist at all?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. I just felt like… I had to obey his words.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Is this also an authority possessed by the ‘King of Humans’.
 </p>
 <p>
  The last disciple of Martial God, indeed not an easy opponent.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So did it go well?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. It worked out well. I’ll have to practice what I learned though.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… You’re going to train again?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  Until Longinus invades, he must master the summoning of Enkidu.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I have to increase the Dragon Flame to 200 and fuse it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The opponent is formidable.
 </p>
 <p>
  This side also had to prepare thoroughly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You can come at the end of May this month, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Both the Space League and promotion matches were at the end of May.
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s words, Yoon Seah scratched her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… Actually, there is a national team match too. We’ll take care of that!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right. Jihan. The Champions League is already practically confirmed. We’ll handle the minor matches.”
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  “Oh. Who are we playing against?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Russia.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In the Northeast Asian League, the Eastern Russia team is staying in the 3-4th place range.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Korean national team, which Yoon Sejin rejoined and Yoon Seah joined after immense growth.
 </p>
 <p>
  They definitely had the power to beat them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if Seong Jihan didn’t step up, it wasn’t difficult to bring back victory.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If nothing happened, I could just participate, but…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Right now, the situation is unknown when he will face off against Longinus.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had to raise his power as much as possible in the void training room and prepare.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I understand. Then I’ll ask you a favor.”
 </p>
 <p>
  But to Seong Jihan, who was going to entrust this regional league match to the Yoon father and daughter and pass,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh. There’s a call from the association?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Buzz buzz…!
 </p>
 <p>
  A call came from the BattleNet Association.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  =Everyone. Thank you for waiting! The match that can confirm advancement to the Champions League as the 1st in the group, the Russia match, will start soon!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Actually, what draws people’s attention the most today is the lineup! There has been a lot of talk about whether player Seong Jihan will participate!
 </p>
 <p>
  =That’s right. The Korean national team has already overcome all the hurdles. Many people said there’s no need to ask player Seong Jihan for help in this situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  The BattleNet national team.
 </p>
 <p>
  After the Space League was launched, it faded a bit.
 </p>
 <p>
  But still, for players, making the national team was a great honor.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, when that player is Seong Jihan, the story is different.
 </p>
 <p>
  The national team was clearly in a disadvantageous position, asking the advantageous Seong Jihan to please participate.
 </p>
 <p>
  =But this time, player Seong Jihan has been included in the lineup!
 </p>
 <p>
  =I heard he personally told the association that he will participate!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Oh. Is it to wrap things up nicely? With player Seong Jihan participating, advancement to the Champions League is confirmed!
 </p>
 <p>
  Player waiting room,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ha Yeonjoo, the leader of the Archer Squad who was listening to the commentators, asked Seong Jihan with a curious expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you really come out to wrap things up?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan smiled and answered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The reason Seong Jihan, who could have skipped the match because of the Longinus issue, deliberately participated was…
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have business with a Russian player.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It was because of a Russian player Vladimir, who was Longinus’ avatar.
 </p>
 <p>
  A few days ago, he recalled the phone call from the association.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Hello, this is Lee Joonsung from the BattleNet Association.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, hello.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At the sudden call from the association, Seong Jihan answered the phone with a slightly suspicious voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Haha, you must be wondering why I called. Actually, it’s because of the national team match against Russia…
 </p>
 <p>
  “The national team match?”
 </p>
 <p>
  – Yes. You must know that if we win this match, we will advance to the Champions League. So I’m calling to ask if you can participate…
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Joonsung carefully asked Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  He knew very well that if Seong Jihan refused, he had no choice but to accept it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm…”
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ah! Of course, you don’t have to if you’re busy! It’s just that the Russian side is insisting that you should participate…
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Russian side is?”
 </p>
 <p>
  – Yes. They said that if you don’t come out, they will boycott the match. They want to face off against you, the world’s best player, at least once…
 </p>
 <p>
  At those words, Seong Jihan’s eyes gleamed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Longinus…!’
 </p>
 <p>
  The avatar of that spear-wielding constellation was a Russian named Vladimir.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the Russian side was strongly insisting on a match against Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It must be Longinus’ will.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The constellation who received an order to kill Seong Jihan from Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was trying to use the national team match as an excuse to face Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘You want to fight me that badly?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan smiled coldly inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  If Longinus wanted it so much, there was no need to refuse.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright. I’ll participate.”
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ah, really? Thank you! Thank you so much!
 </p>
 <p>
  Click!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan hung up the phone while listening to Lee Joonsung’s grateful voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Longinus… I’ll take you on.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather than waiting, it was better to face him head-on.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before the skills he learned from Gilgamesh rusted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Business with a Russian player?”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s words, Ha Yeonjoo and the other national team players looked at him with puzzled expressions.
 </p>
 <p>
  They couldn’t understand why the best player Seong Jihan had to personally handle business with a Russian player.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. An important business.”
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Seong Jihan didn’t explain any further and just smiled softly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The match against Longinus, who was aiming for his life, was not something to be discussed in detail here.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I have to settle it myself.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The worst case scenario he had been preparing for had arrived faster than expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  But there was no need to be afraid.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll show you the power of the Martial Soul.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The power that even shook Gilgamesh, the last disciple of Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan clenched his fists, determined to face Longinus.

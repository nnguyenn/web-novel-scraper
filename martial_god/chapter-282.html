  Chapter 282
 </p>
 <p>
  -Player Seong Jihan. I am Vladimir.
 </p>
 <p>
  The call that came through the association was from Russia’s representative player.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was Vladimir.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Thanks to player Seong Jihan acquiring resources in the previous league competition, my mother also recovered her health. Thank you.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mentioning the benefits of planetary colonization, he started speaking in unfamiliar English.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But I don’t think you contacted me through the association just to say that.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ah. Yes. Actually… My constellation ‘The God Killer’ wants player Seong Jihan to come out for this match.
 </p>
 <p>
  -You mean the Russia match?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yes. If player Seong Jihan comes out, I think he plans to descend into my body again.
 </p>
 <p>
  The constellation ‘The God Killer’ Longinus, who planned to come down to Earth directly and kill Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he was going to come down to the ground anyway, there was no reason for him to bother descending into Vladimir’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  -There’s no need for him to descend… What’s his motive?
 </p>
 <p>
  -That… I am just conveying the constellation’s words as they are. I hope there are no misunderstandings.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Please tell me as much as you want.
 </p>
 <p>
  -‘Seong Jihan. There was an order from the master, but no matter how I think about it, killing you with the spear is a luxury for you. Come out for this match. I’ll crucify and eliminate you.’ …That’s what he said.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if he dies in the national team match, it’s just in the game anyway.
 </p>
 <p>
  As long as there is plenty of GP, he won’t actually die, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan couldn’t grasp Longinus’ intentions, but
 </p>
 <p>
  -And he told me to convey this message too. ‘If you don’t come out, you’ll be the only one at a disadvantage.’ …he said.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ll be the only one at a disadvantage?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought calmly with coldly sunken eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Even if I participate in the match and lose, I won’t die anyway. Rather, this can be more of an opportunity for me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather than quietly waiting for him to come like now and getting attacked.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s more advantageous for Seong Jihan to find out the power of the constellation Longinus through the avatar ‘Vladimir’.
 </p>
 <p>
  I don’t know why the enemy gave such an opportunity, but for now, I have to take it.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Tell him that I’ll participate.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Understood. And…Player Seong Jihan, I will do my best to help.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Pardon?
 </p>
 <p>
  – If player Seong Jihan disappears, humanity will be in danger…! I will try to interfere with the constellation as much as possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan smiled after hearing Vladimir’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  Korea and Russia.
 </p>
 <p>
  They are competitors in the regional league, but from the larger perspective of the Space League, all countries are in a cooperative relationship.
 </p>
 <p>
  He felt the will to cooperate with Seong Jihan, the core player of humanity, in any way possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Don’t overdo it.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yes!
 </p>
 <p>
  After ending the call with Vladimir like that, Seong Jihan participated in the Russia match.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Coach. Please don’t ban player Vladimir.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Coach Noh Youngjun nodded at Seong Jihan’s request and entered the coach’s room.
 </p>
 <p>
  = Game 1, entering the ban phase.
 </p>
 <p>
  = Russia. They’re not banning Player Seong Jihan. Instead, they’re pulling out ban cards for players ranked 1-10!
 </p>
 <p>
  = Do they think it’s difficult to ban Player Seong Jihan anyway?
 </p>
 <p>
  = That’s probably it. Recently, the growth of player Yoon Seah is no joke. Many people are saying she should be in the top 5 among the Archer class.
 </p>
 <p>
  = Logging in twice a day really has tremendous benefits! As time goes on, she’ll show overwhelming growth!
 </p>
 <p>
  = Late Bloomer gift played a really big role. It feels like a big vessel was completed too quickly!
 </p>
 <p>
  = Haha! That’s right. She already became an adult!
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, the commentators, unaware of the behind-the-scenes situation, interpreted this phenomenon from a general perspective when the Russian coach pulled out ban cards for players ranked 1-10 instead of targeting Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Still, isn’t it right to ban Seong Jihan?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Yeah, if Seong Jihan survives, they just give him away for free for one match lol
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Yoon Sejin, Yoon Seah, their destructive power is too strong… Did they just gamble everything on luck? If one of them gets banned along with Seong Jihan, they might still have a chance to win.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -No, looking at Yoon Seah’s recent growth, she might be able to win alone even if she’s the only one left…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  – Yeah, Yoon Seah is also a cheat character, just hidden by the achievements of Seong Jihan lol. They can’t stop her from shooting invisible arrows while in stealth mode.
 </p>
 <p>
  After Seong Jihan and Yoon Sejin, who were originally constants, firmly established themselves with ban cards, now it’s Yoon Seah’s turn.
 </p>
 <p>
  The power of the Korean national team was now firmly in the upper ranks even without Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Oh. But did the Russian coach’s ban work? Player Seong Jihan got banned!
 </p>
 <p>
  =The remaining ban card is targeting Player Ha Yeonjoo!
 </p>
 <p>
  =This should be a fairly successful ban for the Russian coach, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  =Still, we have Players Yoon Sejin and Yoon Seah!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Yes. The map is Southgate, the most favorable map for our side!
 </p>
 <p>
  The ban and select card exchange between Korea and Russia.

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Russia’s ban card could be considered successful for now as it banned Seong Jihan, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll be back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This time, I have to get the series MVP~”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Korean national team had the Yoon father and daughter duo, who are top-class even in the Space League, remaining.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Even without Seong Jihan, it seems like an easy win.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -But they still have Vladimir in the team.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Vladimir gets cut at the Sword King level lol
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -If a constellation doesn’t descend like last time, it’s an easy win lol
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers, who now watch the Korean national team, a strong team, with a relaxed mindset, compared to a year ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the result of the first match matched everyone’s expectations.
 </p>
 <p>
  = The MVP of game 1 goes to player Yoon Sejin!
 </p>
 <p>
  = He single-handedly broke through the gates of Southgate and showed overwhelming power riding on his sword!
 </p>
 <p>
  = Player Yoon Sejin. He became much stronger than what we saw in the previous Space League match. He instantly sliced the Russian players!
 </p>
 <p>
  = That’s right. Did something good happen?
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, who came out of the BattleNet connector, shook her head while looking at Yoon Sejin.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh. Dad is so strong, isn’t he? I can’t keep up at all. Should I take the front line too?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah. You should keep your designated position. Don’t you know teamwork is more important than the score?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t want to hear that from Dad who charged into the enemy gates alone with Twin Swords…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That was my designated role.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin said that while smiling with satisfaction on his lips.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just like what Seong Jihan did in the past, he almost single-handedly blew up the first match.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Brother-in-law. You seem to have gotten stronger.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you see it that way too, it’s not just my feeling. I wonder if there is another effect to the Primordial Blessing bestowed by the constellation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan, who watched the match, said that, as if his guess became a certainty.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin smiled brightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “‘Primordial Blessing’… That was a blessing that helps in growth, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right. But ever since receiving this blessing, my movements have improved in training with the sword. Until just before the game, I wondered if it was just a placebo effect… But hearing Jihan say that, I’m convinced.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Note:- The placebo effect is when a person’s physical or mental health appears to improve after taking a placebo or ‘dummy’ treatment.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Primordial Blessing.
 </p>
 <p>
  To change a player’s movements so drastically in such a short time, it’s quite a significant sponsorship power.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Gilgamesh… Did he sponsor my brother-in-law not just to have a conversation with me?’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan pondered Gilgamesh’s intentions, Ha Yeonjoo, who heard the conversation, looked excited.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow. Yoon Sejin-nim also got a sponsoring constellation? I’m jealous!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ha Yeonjoo said, her eyes sparkling.
 </p>
 <p>
  “When will I get one… Is it because my gift is ambiguous? The constellations don’t even give me a glance.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t Yeonjoo’s gift also SS-grade? You’ll get a sponsor soon. Mine appeared not long ago either.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so…? There’s been talk among top players lately that sponsoring constellations have increased a lot, so I’m a bit nervous.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. It’s said that they increased significantly after the league competition.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Since the league competition? The timing is peculiar.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan asked Ha Yeonjoo.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then do you happen to know the names of the sponsoring constellations that have increased like that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The names… I’m not sure. The players don’t reveal that much.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Since there were many bonuses given to the entire human race in the league competition.
 </p>
 <p>
  Are the constellations no longer considering us a relegation zone and starting sponsorship?
 </p>
 <p>
  Or.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is Gilgamesh sponsoring more than just my brother-in-law?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Unless the name of the constellation is revealed, there’s no way to know exactly what’s at play.
 </p>
 <p>
  But Seong Jihan decided to remember this phenomenon for now.
 </p>
 <p>
  And
 </p>
 <p>
  = Entering the second match!
 </p>
 <p>
  = Russia. They’re coming out with the same ban cards.
 </p>
 <p>
  = This time, players Yoon Sejin and Ha Yeonjoo are banned!
 </p>
 <p>
  = Player Ha Yeonjoo… Isn’t she going to get banned 3 times in a row at this rate?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah. Again?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ha Yeonjoo frowned as she got banned once again.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If the game ends in three matches… I won’t really have a chance to play, will I?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, that could be considered a record, right, Unnie? Surpassing both Uncle and Dad. Three consecutive bans.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Haah… I should be making a mark in national team matches and impressing the constellations.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, constellations probably won’t pay attention to regional league matches like this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you think so? Then, I hope I get banned until the 3rd match. Like Seah said, achieving a record of sorts.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ha Yeonjoo, who is confident the game will end in 3 matches.
 </p>
 <p>
  = Coach Noh Youngjun. He used the ban cards differently this time. He targeted the opponent’s key supporter!
 </p>
 <p>
  And with Coach Noh Youngjun keeping Vladimir alive.

 <p>
  Match 2 was set up for Seong Jihan to face off against him as he intended.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  = Next, the selected map is… ‘Land of Blood’. It’s not a map selected by both team coaches, but a completely different map!
 </p>
 <p>
  = Land of Blood. This is the first time this map has been used in a national team match…
 </p>
 <p>
  = All classes can participate in this map. Not only players from both countries but also monsters are plentiful.
 </p>
 <p>
  = It seems the map classification is survival!
 </p>
 <p>
  Land of Blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  This battlefield, where countless monsters fight alongside each other on the crimson land, was a battlefield with low preference among coaches.
 </p>
 <p>
  To meet the players of the opposing country, you must scatter the blood of a certain number of monsters on the land, the ‘Land of Blood’.
 </p>
 <p>
  Depending on what kind of monsters are summoned next to the national team, the situation could change drastically.
 </p>
 <p>
  -I saw this map being played by other countries, and it was quite random…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Yeah, England, which was ahead in power, lost to Portugal. A herd of giant monsters appeared next to the national team lol.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  – I saw that too. Portugal was fighting orcs, but England got trampled by giant monsters and lost.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -That’s why even weak countries pick this map as a luck-prayer meta lol
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -But no matter how much of a luck map it is, since Seong Jihan is alive, the game is over.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -For real, from the moment Seong Jihan appeared, Russia’s luck ran out.
 </p>
 <p>
  But as long as Seong Jihan was in the lineup, the viewers didn’t worry at all, saying the game was as good as over.
 </p>
 <p>
  Wasn’t it Seong Jihan who even beat down that mighty Dragon Race?
 </p>
 <p>
  No monster existed that could hold back his ankles, no matter how many giant monsters there were.
 </p>
 <p>
  And
 </p>
 <p>
  “On this map, do we just have to kill monsters?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. That’s right. If you keep killing them, the enemy team will appear!”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan asked, a warrior player answered with tense energy.
 </p>
 <p>
  He slowly drew his sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  The monsters summoned around were wyverns, a subspecies of the dragon race.
 </p>
 <p>
  They circled around in the sky and then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kiiiiik!”
 </p>
 <p>
  They all charged at the newly summoned Korean national team at once.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were already powerful, and their ability to fly made them one of the most challenging monster types on the Land of Blood map.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well then, let’s meet them quickly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoooosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  With a calm expression, Seong Jihan raised the Eclipse in his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fundamental Divine Art, Triad of Martial Mastery -Total Annihilation Horizontal Sweep
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack!
 </p>
 <p>
  The sword energy that cleaves the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  Along with it, the wyvern horde shattered into pieces in an instant, falling to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  The wyvern horde, staining the crimson earth with blood.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He’s not even giving time to shoot arrows…”
 </p>
 <p>
  While the national team players were dumbfounded by Seong Jihan’s single slash.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The land is dyed with blood.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Condition fulfilled.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Players from the opposing country will now reveal themselves.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A system message appeared to everyone.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who cleared the first condition as soon as he entered the map.
 </p>
 <p>
  -This is happening so quickly…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -I saw Mexico’s national team wiped out by wyverns last time, but Seong Jihan just blew them away in one shot.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Why didn’t Russia ban Seong Jihan?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Lol they need to be taught a lesson.
 </p>
 <p>
  As viewers speculated on the outcome of the second match while watching the game progress rapidly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now let’s find the Russian players.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, with a calm expression, leaped into the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, in the distance,
 </p>
 <p>
  A massive bloodline shot up into the sky, catching his eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There it is.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t far.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems to be in the north. I’ll scout and be back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  With a burst of aerial momentum, Seong Jihan arrived on the ground in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Have you come?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Vladimir, covered in a reddish hue, greeted Seong Jihan with fierce momentum.

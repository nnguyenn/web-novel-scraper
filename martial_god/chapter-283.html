  Chapter 283
 </p>
 <p>
  =Player Vladimir…
 </p>
 <p>
  =Could this be the appearance of a constellation descending?
 </p>
 <p>
  =Yes. Looking at the footage from Russia, it definitely seems so! Player Vladimir annihilated all the Russian players and even absorbed the blood of the surrounding monsters!
 </p>
 <p>
  Except for Vladimir, the entire Russian team was wiped out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Around him, countless corpses of monsters that shed blood were piled up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to when he faced Seong Jihan in Southgate and Valhalla maps, maybe because he absorbed more blood Vladimir’s momentum was definitely stronger than before,
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘With that level, I think I can win.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Just like Vladimir, Seong Jihan had also gotten much stronger compared to before.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Many eyes are watching.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Vladimir raised his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  Blood burst out in the air and.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah… It’s happening again. The screen is getting covered with blood again!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Even though it’s already revealed that he’s a constellation, why is he covering the screen again!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Of all times, at this important moment…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The broadcast screen was dyed in the color of blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  Blocking the gaze from outside like last time, he stared blankly at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan… In that short time, you’ve grown quite a lot. When I received the order from my master to annihilate you, I couldn’t understand it. But seeing you in person, I understand a bit now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Me too, seeing you in person. You look easier to deal with than I thought.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Shhhhh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Blood energy surged throughout Vladimir’s entire body.
 </p>
 <p>
  The blood streams soon transformed into armor, covering his whole body.
 </p>
 <p>
  And soon, huge blood cross swords appeared in his two hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Prove those words!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  In the blink of an eye, Vladimir charged at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  That movement.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was much faster compared to when they faced each other before.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s not as fast as the Ancient Elf.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to when he fought against the constellation-level Ancient elf, this time Vladimir’s movements were clearly visible.
 </p>
 <p>
  Slash!
 </p>
 <p>
  The blood cross sword strongly slashed down at Seong Jihan, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Phoenix Flag, dyed in Crimson Thunder, easily blocked that attack.
 </p>
 <p>
  Furthermore.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fundamental divine art, Fusion of Divine thunder and phoenix: Crimson Thunder Cannon
 </p>
 <p>
  The Crimson Thunder on the spear tip seemed to stop for a moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  Immediately after, fierce lightning stretched out from the spear tip.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Crimson Thunder Cannon activates instantly without any signs.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then Vladimir’s blood cross swords were instantly dyed in Crimson Thunder, and their momentum noticeably shrank.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Vladimir, who gulped, tried to raise his blood energy again to enlarge the blood cross swords, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Crimson Thunder Cannon didn’t stop with just one shot and poured down several times, striking Vladimir’s entire body.
 </p>
 <p>
  The blood armor deflected the Crimson Thunder’s attacks several times at first, however…
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Unable to endure the continuous attacks, cracks formed on one side of the armor.
 </p>
 <p>
  And like that, once a gap was created.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Crimson Thunder seeped inside and instantly burned Vladimir’s body from the inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then the blood armor disappeared in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  The blood cross swords also rapidly shrunk and disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This… is too easy?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Crimson Thunder and Dragon Flame.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s power, utilizing even the Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit after obtaining the two stats, was on a different level from before.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The stats haven’t even merged yet, but if it’s already at this level. I can expect more later.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who decided to invest all his remaining stat points into Dragon Flame.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a result of pouring stat points, the Dragon Flame was now 197.
 </p>
 <p>
  The gap with Crimson Thunder was only a difference of 3.
 </p>
 <p>
  In fact, with this level, he could try the fusion once, but..
 </p>
 <p>
  With a difference of 3, there’s a case it could fail, Seong Jihan planned to attempt the fusion when both reach 200.
 </p>
 <p>
  But even without fusion, maybe because he invested in Dragon Flame, The power of fire contained in the Crimson Thunder was much stronger than before.
 </p>
 <p>
  To the point where Vladimir, who gathered much more blood than before, disappeared while being engulfed in flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Much stronger than I expected.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  From the puddle of blood far away on the ground, Vladimir suddenly revealed himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  “One. Now it begins.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Shwoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The blood spilled on the ground was absorbed back into Vladimir.
 </p>
 <p>
  He grew slightly larger than his original body.
 </p>
 <p>
  Longinus, wearing blood armor and wielding blood cross swords again.
 </p>
 <p>
  From that state,
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">

   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  He didn’t approach Seong Jihan, but charged towards the monsters behind him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom! Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  The horde of monsters bursted instantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Giant beasts, flying species, and monsters gathered in groups all had their blood sucked whenever Longinus approached.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan quietly watched that sight with his arms crossed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Vladimir, absorbing the blood of monsters, was growing his strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it was a real battle, he would have tried as much as possible to stop this.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Right now, the avatar form of Longinus is no match for me. He needs to become as strong as possible here to prepare for when the real constellation Longinus descends later.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather, in the game, there’s no big penalty even if you lose.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead of easily blowing him up like before, it was better to let him raise his strength in resistance.
 </p>
 <p>
  That way, by fighting the strengthened Vladimir, he could obtain useful information for when he actually clashes with the constellation Longinus.
 </p>
 <p>
  And
 </p>
 <p>
  “This level… is the limit of this avatar…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Vladimir, who had grown about twice as large as before, muttered like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so? Then I’m coming.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan unfolded his arms and immediately went to him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Blood Absorption!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The much stronger Vladimir than before reached out his hand to Seong Jihan to suck out his blood like he did to the monsters,
 </p>
 <p>
  but
 </p>
 <p>
  His blood energy couldn’t penetrate Seong Jihan’s Martial Soul at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this the end?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Slash!
 </p>
 <p>
  The enlarged Eclipse cut Vladimir’s body and.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sizzle…
 </p>
 <p>
  The blood flowing out from Vladimir’s body reconnected his split body.
 </p>
 <p>
  Vladimir, whose damage was easily restored, unlike when he was hit by the Crimson Thunder a while ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  He blankly stared at the dark sword Eclipse that cut him, and asked Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…You’re not going to use that red lightning from before? With a single blow like this, I can regenerate as much as I want.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. If I use that, it’d be too easy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha. You’re being arrogant…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Vladimir flared up and stretched his sword towards Seong Jihan, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang! Clang!
 </p>
 <p>
  The two swords exchanged several blows, and then
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Before long, the blood cross sword split apart.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud! Thud…
 </p>
 <p>
  Even his head fell to the ground and rolled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “See? It’s easy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Shwing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan sheathed his sword and looked at the fallen head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I see. No matter how much power I gather by descending into an avatar, there’s a limit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Vladimir spoke from his severed head state.
 </p>
 <p>
  His attitude was indifferent as if he had expected such a defeat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I admit it. I can’t deal with you with just an avatar.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey… What was your motive for asking me to participate?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you were going to annihilate me according to Martial God’s orders, you could have just descended to Earth directly and stabbed me. What’s the reason for fighting me in-game through an avatar?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Longinus, who said it was a luxury to use the Spear Of Judgement on Seong Jihan and that he would crucify him and eliminate him if he came out for this game.
 </p>
 <p>
  But he couldn’t even touch a hair on Seong Jihan and was being overwhelmingly pushed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The reason is…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Shhh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Vladimir’s face disappeared while turning into blood at Seong Jihan’s question.
 </p>
 <p>
  His head regenerated from the body that had flown away.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You remodeled my Karma in your own way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you talking about the Iron Blood Cross? I did.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan drew a cross with two fingers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Fundamental Divine Arts, Annihilation God’s Secret – Blood Cross.
 </p>
 <p>
  Buzzzz…!
 </p>
 <p>
  A pure white cross of light floated in front of Seong Jihan as if protecting him.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Iron Blood Cross, which previously required crossing weapons to manifest.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, it could be easily manifested with just two fingers.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Manifesting that just with fingers.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “People have to improve.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Vladimir’s expression distorted upon hearing those words.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who completely destroyed the set method of ‘Karma’ and remodeled it in his own way.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whenever he saw that, the instinctive displeasure that welled up was hard to control.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  “…So, is that the end of it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  He asked Seong Jihan, trying hard to suppress that emotion.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I asked if that’s the end of you remodeling my Karma.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who knows? I haven’t used it much these days.”
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  “I see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Shhhh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The blood cross disappeared from Vladimir’s hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, try remodeling my Karma from now on.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead, a blood spear slowly began to form.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you can’t do that, you will eventually die by my hands.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Spear Of Judgement, which can only be used with Martial God’s permission.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was grasped in Vladimir’s hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  The blood spear of Longinus.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was well aware of its destructive power.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘In the end, it was Longinus’ spear that broke the Thunder God’s protective wall.’
 </p>
 <p>
  That powerful Martial God pulled out that blood spear as a weapon when he was blocked by the wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although there was a big difference in power between the blood spear used by Martial God and the one being used by the avatar Vladimir.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anyway, the Spear Of Judgement exuded an intense presence just by appearing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Didn’t you tell Vladimir to convey your message that using that spear on me would be a luxury to me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan closely observed the appearance of the blood spear and made a remark.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I won’t stab you right now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Drip! Drip…
 </p>
 <p>
  Longinus, dripping blood from his whole body onto the ground, said that.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  Since summoning the Spear Of Judgement Vladimir’s body was rapidly losing form, but Without caring about the condition of his own body, he pointed the spear tip towards Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m just aiming it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Tap!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s body stiffened rigidly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…This is.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The phenomenon he felt when he was directly hit by the Spear Of Judgement before.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not only does he lose control of his body.
 </p>
 <p>
  Vladimir’s body, which was rapidly collapsing, also stayed still with blood droplets suspended in the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Time seems to have stopped… Just like last time. Almost no control over my body.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Seong Jihan had become incomparably stronger than before When the Spear Of Judgement targeted him, his body wouldn’t move at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  The only things trying to move from the inside were the powers of Martial Soul and Void.
 </p>
 <p>
  The newly acquired Crimson Thunder and Dragon Flame stats didn’t budge at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  In that situation where everything stopped.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sizzle…
 </p>
 <p>
  Only the blood spear wriggled, and a bloody mist rose from the spear tip.
 </p>
 <p>
  And on it, faintly rising purple letters.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Target condition, partially matched]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Destruction code manifested]
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the same text he saw when Longinus’ spear stabbed him before.
 </p>
 <p>
  Right now, he’s just aiming it still, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  If the spear actually stabs, that ‘Destruction Code’ will instantly erase Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  In fact, even if that happens, it’s just dying in-game so there’s no big loss for Seong Jihan, but..
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…If I can’t move like this even against the Spear Of Judgement created by an avatar, I absolutely won’t be able to respond to the actual spear fired by the real Longinus.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The time-stopping ability of the Spear Of Judgement.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he couldn’t overcome this, death was inevitable.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The force isn’t completely immobile, but…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial Soul and Void, which had become stronger than before, tried to somehow move and overcome this situation, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s body didn’t budge at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This won’t do.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan, who had been relaxed until now, focused all his attention on the current situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wa-wait. Player Seong Jihan…! I will help you!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, the form of the blood spear disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Different from the constellation Longinus until now, The player Vladimir, who was the avatar, urgently spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You fool…! What are you doing!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No matter how much of a constellation you are… I can’t just leave player Seong Jihan to die!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This guy…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A mixture of Constellation and Player Vladimir.
 </p>
 <p>
  Two beings conversing with one mouth, an Avatar.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing this, Seong Jihan sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s not like he was really dying.
 </p>
 <p>
  Why did you have to pop out at this important moment?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Vladimir. It’s okay.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please rest. This is an opportunity for me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah. Did I perhaps… ruin things?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you stay, it seems like you will.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The player Vladimir, who tried to enthusiastically help Seong Jihan, disappeared with a dejected face.
 </p>
 <p>
  Longinus, who regained control of the body, made a dumbfounded expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Ha. Taking advantage of the gap when I summoned the Spear Of Judgement, Who thought the avatar would rebel? It’s absurd.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey. Can you do it again?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…It’s possible.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then wait a moment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan opened the status window.
 </p>
 <p>
  Void and Martial Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  With just the two of them, he couldn’t overcome the time stop.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Dragon Flame and Crimson Thunder… I’ll have to fuse them.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether the new ability created by mixing the two unique stats would work or not.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was time to experiment.

  Chapter 284
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan examined the Dragon Flame stat in the status window.
 </p>
 <p>
  Next to the Dragon Flame that reached 197, unlike other stats, there was a + mark.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan pressed it.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do you want to attempt fusion of Dragon Flame with the unique stat, Crimson Thunder?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The stat fusion window that was put on hold before was revealed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The value of stat ‘Dragon Flame’ is 3 lower than Crimson Thunder.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [There is a slight probability that the stat fusion will fail.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do you really want to attempt the stat fusion?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Even a difference of 3 is still a difference, so there is a probability of failure according to the system message.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s do it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Seong Jihan ignored this and proceeded forcibly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dragon Flame and Crimson Thunder are fusing…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The fusion process is progressing deeply in connection with the user’s existing abilities.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The existing ability, ‘Martial Soul’, more efficiently combines ‘Dragon Flame’ and ‘Crimson Thunder’ and transforms them to fit the current situation.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The existing ability, ‘Void’, finds traces of the Red Administrator in the two stats.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Several lines of system messages floated in front of Seong Jihan’s eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among them, what stood out the most was.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Traces of the Red Administrator…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The traces of the Red Administrator found by the Void.
 </p>
 <p>
  It makes sense for Dragon Flame, as it was an ability granted by the Red Administrator to the Dragon Lord.
 </p>
 <p>
  But in the case of Crimson Thunder, it was an ability that Seong Jihan modified for Brahma, the leader of the Thunder Gods.
 </p>
 <p>
  How this was related to the Red Administrator was questionable.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Am I really related to the Red Administrator?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Is there really a secret about my birth or something?
 </p>
 <p>
  Pondering that, Seong Jihan watched the progress of the matter for now.
 </p>
 <p>
  The power of Crimson Thunder and Dragon Flame that was fully remaining in his body disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Chiiing!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even for him who was used to pain, an intensely dizzying pain occurred.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s chest skin burned and the flames soon gathered into a form.
 </p>
 <p>
  A crescent-shaped, red pattern was deeply imprinted in the center of Seong Jihan’s chest.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was tiny, only the size of a fingernail, but it contained the powers of both Crimson Thunder and Dragon Flame, two unique stats.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have acquired the gradeless stat, ‘Red’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [TL/N: it just says red, idk what to tell you]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial Soul was the ability of the constellations.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Void, on the contrary, was unranked.
 </p>
 <p>
  The newly added Red stat also had no grade, just like Void.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stat fusion is a great success.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stat ‘Red’ increases by 1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite being a great success, it increased by only 1.
 </p>
 <p>
  At first, Seong Jihan thought so.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This Red stat… The ability value is only 5. It’s worthy of being called a great success.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The result of devouring two unique stats with stat points of 200 and 197.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was ‘Red’ stat 5.
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering that it added 1 to 4, the reward for a great success was significant.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But how do I use this?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Red.
 </p>
 <p>
  Judging by the name alone, it seems to be a high-grade ability related to the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  But there was no clue as to how to actually utilize this ability.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can draw out Crimson Thunder and Dragon Flame similarly to before, but…’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan opened his palm.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle!
 </p>
 <p>
  A Red lightning fiercely rose from his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crimson Thunder, which definitely merged with Dragon Flame compared to when it was used a while ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the stat decreased from 200 to 5 by merging into Red, the firepower was much stronger.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is this the end?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan had doubts.
 </p>
 <p>
  The gradeless stat Red.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like it would have uses other than just combining Dragon Flame and Crimson Thunder…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Looks like it’s over. Then, I’ll go attack now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, as Seong Jihan’s power grew stronger.
 </p>
 <p>
  Vladimir, who had absorbed blood by catching the surrounding monsters, arrived in front of him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. Come.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In fact, there were many questions about the ability ‘Red’ to say it was over like Vladimir said.
 </p>
 <p>
  But this wasn’t a problem that would be concluded even if he dragged out time anyway.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Rather, if I utilize the ability in a situation where the time has stopped like before, I might get a clue.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan nodded while thinking like that,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The blood spear rose from Longinus’ hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is the last time. This avatar can’t endure any more than this.”
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">

   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  “I understand.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you can’t overcome the aim of the blood spear this time too, you will definitely die by my hands. Because the main body’s spear is much stronger than this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Longinus said that since the main body’s spear is stronger than the avatar’s, Seong Jihan needs to overcome at least this much.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan smiled at those words and gestured to him.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thanks for worrying. I’ll overcome it, so hurry up and aim.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmph! Then…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Drip! Drip…
 </p>
 <p>
  Longinus, whose form began to collapse, aimed the spear tip and,
 </p>
 <p>
  “This time, I’ll go all the way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  The spear slowly began to fly towards Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the same time, Vladimir’s whole body collapsed and shed blood on the floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike when he aimed the first spear, maybe because he threw the spear the second time, Longinus couldn’t maintain the avatar any longer.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It stopped again.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Tap!
 </p>
 <p>
  The body was motionless once more.
 </p>
 <p>
  The only things wriggling were the three forces within him.
 </p>
 <p>
  The power of Martial Soul, Void, and the Red imprinted on his chest.
 </p>
 <p>
  They tried to somehow create movement even in the completely frozen world.
 </p>
 <p>
  And
 </p>
 <p>
  Wriggle!
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike a moment ago, Seong Jihan’s body moved slightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Maybe because the power of Red was added, he finally escaped from the complete restraint of time stop, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Even so, I can’t move enough to avoid the spear.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was impossible to block the Spear Of Judgement slowly flying over towards him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Is this the limit even after obtaining Red?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…I can’t even utilize Enkidu.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The summoning of Enkidu that Gilgamesh taught him to throw instead at the Spear Of Judgement.
 </p>
 <p>
  But unless he could overcome this time stop, summoning Enkidu was impossible.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he can’t even block the avatar’s spear, can he really overcome it when the constellation Longinus descends?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I have to overcome this somehow.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was thinking of a solution to the current situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sizzle…
 </p>
 <p>
  The Spear Of Judgement slowly flew over and emitted smoke from the tip.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Target condition have been partially matched]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Destruction code manifested]
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, like before, unknown letters floated on the Spear Of Judgement.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  There was a difference from a moment ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm…’
 </p>
 <p>
  [Target Lock Code Execution in Progress]
 </p>
 <p>
  Below the emerging letters,
 </p>
 <p>
  a crimson text that hadn’t been seen before appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do you want to retrieve the command?]
 </p>
 <p>
  A system window with a red background that had never been seen before appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Crimson letters, and a system window with a red background.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Did I acquire the abilities of the adversary, revealing hidden codes?’ Seong Jihan pondered, attempting to press ‘yes,’ but his body remained motionless due to the time-stopped state.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Retrieving the command.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Maybe because it was possible with just willpower, the system entered the retrieval process.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The third line, [Target Lock Code Execution in Progress], flew from the spear tip towards Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  It went into the pattern where the power of Red gathered, near his chest.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, as the time stopped, the state was released.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Command recalled.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Red capacity reached its limit. Unable to recall commands any further.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A portion of the letters that had entered Seong jihan’s chest pattern emerged again, quickly darting towards the window.
 </p>
 <p>
  With his Red’s stats only at 5, there seemed to be a limit to absorption. Despite the command being recalled, Seong Jihan could move freely, except for:
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can still move.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though the letters were retrieved, Seong Jihan could move freely.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Target Stop Code letters are being written again.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The crimson letters that entered the bottom line again.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were summoning the front letters that Seong Jihan had absorbed.
 </p>
 <p>
  When that sentence is completed, it will enter a time stop like before.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan drew his Phoenix Spear and aimed it at the slowly approaching blood spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fundamental divine art, Fusion of Divine thunder and phoenix: Crimson Thunder cannon
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Crimson Thunder Cannon, which naturally contained the power of Dragon Flame and became much stronger than when it was used a while ago, directly hit the blood spear, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Its not working.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Before the Crimson Thunder Cannon could even touch the blood spear, the Red’s presence vanished entirely.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Destruction code embedded in the Spear Of Judgement eradicated anything blocking its path.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No matter how hard I try to avoid it, it eventually follows.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Even when he went up to the sky using the Flashing Steps to the extreme.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  The Spear Of Judgement was slowly flying with its tip aimed at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he doesn’t get hit by the time stop, the spear is slow, so he won’t get hit if he keeps running away.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If the red letters are completed again, it will be the same as before.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As long as time remained unstopped, continuously evading might work, but it wasn’t a long-term solution.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll have to use that.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who had gone up to the sky, landed on the ground again.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Summon Enkidu.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He used what he learned from Gilgamesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Steel chains stretched out from behind Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clank! Clank!
 </p>
 <p>
  They clumped together and transformed into an existence wearing steel armor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not as big as the one Gilgamesh summoned but still, it was a steel giant more than twice the size of a human.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s command.
 </p>
 <p>
  The steel giant leaped up and stood as if protecting his front.
 </p>
 <p>
  With just one jump, the life force was noticeably consumed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can’t use this guy as a summon in the current state.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The power Enkidu possessed was tremendous, but the consumption of strength to operate it was too severe.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to use it for its original purpose for now and.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  He stood next to Enkidu.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Target condition have been completely matched]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Target changed]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Destruction code manifested]
 </p>
 <p>
  The letters rising from the Spear Of Judgement changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The spear tip aimed at Enkidu now and not Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, unlike a moment ago, the Spear Of Judgement flew at a fast speed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Enkidu… This is how it works.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan watched this from the side.
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, maybe because he wasn’t the target, he didn’t become the subject of the time stop.
 </p>
 <p>
  He looked at his freely moving body and,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ve confirmed the target changes, so I should get hit.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  Before the spear pierced Enkidu, he threw his body in front of it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anyway, this is not reality, but inside the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had experienced dying by the Spear Of Judgement before, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  He decided to get hit one more time to increase his experience.
 </p>
 <p>
  And
 </p>
 <p>
  Poof!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The blood spear, right before piercing Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  It curved upwards and only pierced Enkidu, not him, and disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  The blood spear that accurately eliminates only the target.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There was a reason Gilgamesh taught me to use this when facing the Spear Of Judgement.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Making it impossible to die even if you want to.
 </p>
 <p>
  Enkidu was really effective in dealing with the Spear Of Judgement.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the blood spear disappeared like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Uh…
 </p>
 <p>
  =Th-the screen is visible again!
 </p>
 <p>
  =But match 2… is over?
 </p>
 <p>
  =What on earth happened?
 </p>
 <p>
  =Tsk. Seriously. This always happens when only player Vladimir comes out…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Match 2 ended with that.
 </p>
 <p>
  ***
 </p>
 <p>
  [South Korea won against Russia 3:0.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [South Korea’s national team advances as the 1st place in the Champions League group!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Vladimir, who had a constellation descend again, “He said he won’t descend anymore because I didn’t listen,” he said with a tearful face.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Still with overwhelming Seong Jihan and the noticeably stronger Yoon Sejin, The South Korean national team rises as the top contender for the championship!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Defeating Russia 3-0, the South Korean national team secured their spot as the 1st place in the World Champions League group.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the Champions League’s status was somewhat diminished compared to before due to the Space League.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nevertheless, perhaps due to securing their Champions League spot with overwhelming strength, South Korea was in a festive mood.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle. Where are you going?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have to train.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh, training maniac… We’re celebrating securing 1st place, aren’t we? Can’t you take a break today?”
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter what, training even on a day like today.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah grabbed Seong Jihan, who said he was going to train, telling him to take a break.
 </p>
 <p>
  On a special day, it would have been enough to grant his niece’s request for a day, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll be back in a bit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as he returned to Earth, Seong Jihan had no room for that due to the message that popped up.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Fully absorb and conceal the stat ‘Red’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [If concealment fails, the Great Constellations aiming for the position of the Red Administrator will detect you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Time remaining 24:00:00]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan waved his hand and immediately entered the Void training room.

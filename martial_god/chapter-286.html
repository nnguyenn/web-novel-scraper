  Chapter 286
 </p>
 <p>
  The Space League match between humans and the Zojin race, replayed on TV, was a fiercely contested game that went to five rounds.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Oh, the Zojin race banned the first-place player again!
 </p>
 <p>
  =It seems like they’re conscious of Seong Jihan, considering how one-sided it was during the ‘Planet Colonization’ last time.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Even though player Seong Jihan is not present, he’s helping humanity in some way. We are overwhelmingly taking an advantageous position in the ban cards!
 </p>
 <p>
  The commentators were shouting while watching the exchange of ban cards between The Zojin’ representative and humanity’s coach Davis.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though Seong Jihan didn’t participate, humanity was greatly benefiting from the ban cards.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I didn’t play, so does that mean Oliver got banned again?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, the ban cards were completely in our favor. But…”
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah. The Red Sky map… It came out again!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Isn’t BattleNet too much? How can they only assign maps that are overwhelmingly advantageous to flying races?
 </p>
 <p>
  =Still, since we’ve experienced it once before, I believe the human team is thoroughly prepared!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Sky map.
 </p>
 <p>
  From the beginning, this map, where players start in the sky, was overwhelmingly advantageous for the winged race. Of course, even the human players summoned to the sky didn’t immediately plummet; they started the game with a flying spell. However, it was obvious who would have the upper hand when the race born to fly in the sky faced off against humans who relied on flying spells.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah. The Sword King. He’s trying to endure as much as possible, but…!
 </p>
 <p>
  =The Zojin players are really taking advantage of the benefits of being a flying race!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah! They are attacking from the rear again…!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Th-the human players! They are annihilated…
 </p>
 <p>
  [Once you lock down that monster, they’re just an insignificant race!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [How are they maintaining their rank? It’s baffling!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you just ban the 1st place, We will definitely win.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The mockery of The Zojin toying with humanity in aerial combat was translated and heard.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah…
 </p>
 <p>
  =Without player Seong Jihan, they can’t win.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Even though only one person is missing, the gap is too big.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Humanity faces their first defeat in the Space League…
 </p>
 <p>
  =The ranking drastically drops to 7th place.
 </p>
 <p>
  Humanity’s ranking, which had risen to the top, fell to 7th place.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  -No, no matter what, does it make sense to lose to the lowest rank?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -You saw the game, right? Those guys drew the map select cards too well.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -But they didn’t have any ban cards either.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Ignoring Oliver?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Even if Oliver is strong, he’s only at 0.1% of Seong Jihan’s level. LOL.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Underestimating Seong Jihan? More like 0.001%.
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers watching the game exploded with comments.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Where the hell did Seong Jihan go? As humanity’s rank 1, he has no sense of responsibility.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -What happened to him?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -They said he went to the training room and didn’t come out…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -He should have stopped training and come out for such an important match!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -He probably didn’t expect us to lose to the lowest rank like this 🙁
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -But even if he came out, he would have been continuously banned anyway. Shouldn’t they be able to win without Seong Jihan?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -The performance humanity showed in this game was terrible…
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the foreign viewers, there were voices blaming Seong Jihan, but
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather than that, there were higher voices urging the human national team to reflect on losing to the last place team just because one person was missing.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Commentators, the aftermath of yesterday’s game loss is intense.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Yes. The human representative team without Seong Jihan… everyone saw that reality yesterday. Of course, the Zojin race also showed a strong performance, but still.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Actually, among the races we faced, there were no weak ones. The World Tree Elves were strong, and even the Orcs had very powerful leaders. And what about the Dragons? They were formidable as well. In a way, being in the current ranking was nothing short of a miracle.
 </p>
 <p>
  =If we assume that player Seong Jihan was absent like this time, which of the previous games would we have been able to win?

 </div>
 <p>
  =None. We probably couldn’t have won a single game.
 </p>
 <p>
  The cold analysis of experts said that if Seong Jihan wasn’t there, they wouldn’t have won a single game.
 </p>
 <p>
  In fact, the number of wins humanity had accumulated so far and their current ranking were miraculous results.
 </p>
 <p>
  =With this defeat, the ranking has dropped, and dungeon portals have started appearing everywhere, and the GP market price has also risen.
 </p>
 <p>
  =The benefits of being in the top ranks have disappeared…
 </p>
 <p>
  =When will player Seong Jihan return…?
 </p>
 <p>
  After listening to the experts’ analysis of yesterday’s defeat on the news, Seong Jihan turned his gaze.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ve seen it all, so let’s turn off the TV now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Beep!
 </p>
 <p>
  “We didn’t have much luck with the map in this game.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Still, we should have won. We were lacking.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Fair enough.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Zojin, who escaped the relegation zone thanks to their flying characteristics in the previous life as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks to Seong Jihan, all the human players survived compared to the previous life. Although they received a significant growth rate adjustment, there were still many shortcomings.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘For the growth bonus effect to be properly felt, a few more months need to pass… Until then, I should think of us as the lowest among all races.’
 </p>
 <p>
  No. Even if growth skyrockets after a few months, there’s no guarantee they’ll escape the bottom.
 </p>
 <p>
  Humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the solemn world of BattleNet, they were a race with no real advantages.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That’s why, even more so, we need to go up to the promotion match this season and escape from the BattleNet.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Other races that have tasted the power of Seong Jihan, when facing humanity, They set banning the 1st place as the first principle.
 </p>
 <p>
  Right now, there weren’t many races that had experienced Seong Jihan’s power, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  As they all take turns playing matches and get pushed back by Seong Jihan’s strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the next match, they will definitely focus on restraining him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Even if I get banned in the Space League, I can avoid it because of the premium membership… But in the end, probability is probability.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He may be able to avoid being banned several times, but getting banned in all 5 games is also the effect of probability, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  He had to reap all the victories and get promoted with superior results while the enemy races still didn’t know about Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, suddenly…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah~ I used the gym well today… Huh? Boss, you’re back!?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon and Lim Gayeong, who came out of the training room in the penthouse, were surprised to see Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Hayeon, you also exercise here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. These days, I have some free time, so I’ve been relying on Gayeong to build some stamina. There’s one in the guild too. But it’s more comfortable here because there are no people. I’ve been coming for a month, but…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so? Why haven’t I seen you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Because Uncle is rarely at home and only stays in the training room.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Indeed. It’s been a long time since I went to the training room.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  The training room in the penthouse was good, but it was nothing compared to the Void training room.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did something happen to you, Boss? Since you didn’t come, there have been a lot of inquiries from all over the world. People were wondering if there was an accident.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I didn’t realize how time flew by during training. I’m sorry for missing out on the game yesterday.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He couldn’t tell the detailed circumstances related to the Red stat.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan just stated his position, saying he was late because of training.
 </p>
 <p>
  At those words, Lee Hayeon frowned and lowered her voice slightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Because of training… Then how about we just say ‘something happened’?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you mean by something?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right now, all of humanity is in a state of deep disappointment due to the first defeat. I’m worried that if we just say it’s because of training, you might receive unnecessary criticism.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right. If we say it’s because of training, it seems like the malicious comments will increase a hundredfold.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Regarding humanity’s first defeat, there were many cases around the world where people were criticizing and asking where Seong Jihan had gone especially for people from countries that had bad ties with Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were condemning him in the global BattleNet community, saying that humanity’s rank 1 lacked a sense of responsibility.
 </p>
 <p>
  But if they say here that he couldn’t participate because of training, it could be like pouring oil on the fire.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s fine. It’s true that I was late. I’ll just take some criticism.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan didn’t care about this at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a situation where the constellation Longinus was coming to kill him, What does it matter if he receives a little more criticism from people he doesn’t know?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘In the end, the ones who will regret it are humanity.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking that, Seong Jihan asked Lee Hayeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How is the guild channel? Are the subscribers increasing a bit?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No. Actually, because our guild is a place that nurtures players from other guilds, There isn’t much content. The most attention is on selecting nurturing players.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then I will state my position there regarding not participating in this Space League.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “On the guild channel… Will that be okay? Rather than the day after the defeat, it would be better to do it after some time…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s fine. I have to go to the promotion match anyway.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The promotion match will be held tomorrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  If Seong Jihan appears there, everyone will know that he has returned.

 <p>
  It was better to state his position on not participating in the Space League game this time now.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I understand. Then I will instruct the setup preparations.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lim Gayeong, who was silently listening to this conversation from behind, picked up her cell phone and instructed the guild staff to prepare for the broadcast.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They say the setup will take about 10 minutes. The channel… Shall I open it in advance?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sure.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Then I will go down to finish up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Boss, See you in a bit~”
 </p>
 <p>
  With Lee Hayeon and Lim Gayeong going down like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then I’ll go wash up and come.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay, Uncle.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who had been in the Void training room for a long time, also went to the bathroom to wash up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah sat on the sofa waiting for Seong Jihan like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They said they opened the channel, right? How many have come?”
 </p>
 <p>
  She went to BattleTube on her cell phone and accessed the guild channel.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Player Seong Jihan returns!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The video with that title and in preparation.
 </p>
 <p>
  -What? Really?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -For real, he’s back?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Ah, why did he come today…
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -It’s not a lie, right?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Would the Daegi guild lie;
 </p>
 <p>
  At first, Korean people gathered first and the chat rose up, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Seong has returned?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Why did he come only after all the games ended!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Seong Jihan needs to have a sense of responsibility. How can he not return before an important match?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Humanity has fallen into a crisis due to the irresponsibility of the rank 1!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Are they crazy lol! Isn’t the problem that we lost to the last place? The national flags are all displayed when you type in the chat. Know that you might not get a T/O from the Daegi guild if you criticize Seong Jihan here.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Threatening for a seat, they’re shamelessly petty!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Ah, then why don’t you make a nurturing guild yourself?
 </p>
 <p>
  It didn’t take long before the chat IDs were followed by flags from around the world, and lively conversations ensued.
 </p>
 <p>
  And in an instant, the number of viewers increased.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s over. It feels refreshing to take a shower after a long time. Seah, do you want to go?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh… um….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re going?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But there are over a hundred million.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh? What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah pushed her phone towards Seong Jihan, who was drying his hair.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The viewers. We already surpassed a hundred million! It’s insane!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A hundred million? In ten minutes? That’s a lot.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Already gaining global attention, Seong Jihan, who missed yesterday’s game due to his absence, was being eagerly awaited by people from all over the world to hear his words.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The number of pre-waiting viewers has surpassed 100 million.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have cleared the special achievement, ‘Waiting for you!’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’ve obtained 1,000,000 achievement points as a reward.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Not bad.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan chuckled while looking at the messages popping up in front of him.
 </p>
 <p>
  He thought he had cleared almost all viewer achievements, but there was still pre-waiting left.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle… Let’s just say ‘something happened’. If it’s 100 million now, more will gather later, right? If you say there that you couldn’t come because of training…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s okay.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite Yoon Seah’s worries, Seong Jihan said it was okay and went down to the guild building.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s been a while, Everyone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He revealed himself on the guild channel screen.

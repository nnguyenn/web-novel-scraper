  Chapter 290
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kill Gilgamesh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan furrowed his brow.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh, the fifth disciple of the Martial god and the Constellation known as ‘The King of Humans’.
 </p>
 <p>
  Outwardly, he had been amiable towards Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had warned about Longinus and even taught him Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit and Enkidu.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, his true intentions were unknowable, but Seong Jihan couldn’t oppose him based solely on the Arena owner’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan slowly opened his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…So as long as Gilgamesh lives, even if I clear BattleNet, invitations will keep coming?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s correct.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzing…
 </p>
 <p>
  The face of the Arena owner, now formed of the universe, transformed again.
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, the face revealed was…
 </p>
 <p>
  [Inviting Earthlings to BattleNet.]
 </p>
 <p>
  It was an invitation from the year 2010, the one humanity received from BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Humanity is pathetically weak. Sending them a BattleNet invitation means extinction for the race. We are cautious because of this. Humanity as a species must far exceed our set threshold before an invitation is sent.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “And you’re saying Gilgamesh crossed that line? But he’s from a long time ago. Shouldn’t the invitation have been sent sooner?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He had not been detected until now. Hiding from the eyes of the Void, he lay in concealment. Now that his existence and role as a traitor are confirmed, the invitations will continue.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you want to catch the traitor that badly, why not go to where Gilgamesh is instead of attacking Earth?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where Gilgamesh is…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The face of the Arena’s owner then transformed into that place.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking at that barren planet where numerous Constellation weapons floated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan realized that the Arena owner was also aware of that place.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We cannot intervene there. ‘The Wandering Martial God’, the owner of that place, has an agreement with a higher being – one which even we do not know.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So you’re targeting Earth?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Gilgamesh’s foundation is ultimately humanity of Earth. If humanity is eradicated, he will lose his base and weaken.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…How do you know all this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Rustle!
 </p>
 <p>
  In response to Seong Jihan’s question, purple chains emerged behind the Arena’s owner.
 </p>
 <p>
  They didn’t carry the life force like the chains of Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit, but the chains exuded a far more potent power of the Void.
 </p>
 <p>
  “‘The Void’s Binding Chains’. I gave this ability to Gilgamesh. It’s the original, altered for him. With such a connection, I am somewhat aware of him.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So you’re from the Void’s Faction.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right. I am quite high-ranking, managing the Arena, after all.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Arena owner introduced himself as a high-ranking official of the Void.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought of his sister, Seong Jiah.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, do you know how the ‘Witch of the Void’ can return to her original state?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Witch of the Void?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Taken aback by the sudden shift from Gilgamesh to the Witch of the Void, the Arena owner, after a moment’s silence, changed his face again.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the petrified form of Seong Jiah.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Witch of Earth… Quite a talent. With her caliber, she would be held in high regard even in the Void.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Arena owner extended his hand, and a purple key materialized out of the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you take down Gilgamesh for us, I will give you this key with my authority.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This key?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Unlock the witch’s lock, and she’ll return to her original state.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘An unexpected lead to free my sister.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan stared quietly at the key.
 </p>
 <p>
  Freedom for humanity and his sister’s return.
 </p>
 <p>
  The rewards for dealing with Gilgamesh were substantial.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The question is, can I trust his words?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The words of entities from the Space League should always be sifted with caution.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially the Arena’s owner, whose face was like a space itself, seemed too suspicious to fully trust.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thus maintained a reserved stance.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I am merely a player ascending from Diamond to Master League. It’s too soon to confront him.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Heh. Of course I know that, I’m not asking you to kill him immediately. Even with your abilities, you wouldn’t be able to.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Step! Step!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Arena’s owner nodded and stepped back.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Just remember it if you desire to free humanity from BattleNet and wish to restore the Witch of the Void to her original state.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll keep that in mind.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not blindly trusting. That’s a good attitude.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssshhh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The owner’s figure gradually blended into the darkness.
 </p>
 <p>
  “And while I will overlook this… Be cautious about revealing the Red administrator’s abilities. If you attract the attention of Great Constellations, you might face great distress.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thanks for the advice.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No problem at all. I hope you remain a ‘variable’ for a long time to come.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With those final words, the Arena’s owner vanished.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The promotion battle is ending.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Player Seong Jihan is being promoted to Master League.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Logging out.]
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  [First Master, Seong Jihan.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The result of training is fire ability? Seong Jihan’s abilities were different from before.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Seong Jihan’s promotion match, where more than half of the game footage was not visible.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Why isn’t there any translation? Viewers of Battletube are raging with complaints.]
 </p>
 <p>
  News everywhere covered Seong Jihan’s ascent to Master League following his solo promotion battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  An incredible spotlight, almost unbelievable for one player.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet when considering the immense role Seong Jihan plays in humanity’s BattleNet forces, the attention was justified.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why’s the screen keep going blank?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Every time some transcendental beings show up, the broadcast gets cut.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Is it Seong Jihan pausing it?
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -I don’t think so. It must be his opponents who are blocking the videos.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Even the conversation with that fireball wasn’t translated.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  -Lol been so used to automatic translations, that alien language was something else.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This promotion match was quite intense.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even Yoon Seah, who meticulously reads Seong Jihan’s news, nodded while reading the replies.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s up?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Only the parts where Uncle sweeps away the mobs were visible. Towards the end, there’s hardly any footage available. Plus all that fireball spoke wasn’t translated.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “At first I couldn’t hear what it was saying either.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The language of the Fire God was only audible to Seong Jihan after absorbing its power.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan realized viewers had continued to hear its untranslated language.
 </p>
 <p>
  He quickly played back the BattleTube footage.
 </p>
 <p>
  The moment the remnants of the Fire God revealed their true form, the video was entirely deleted.
 </p>
 <p>
  And atop the dark screen were words etched secretly in purple.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Video deleted by the owner of the Arena.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan asked Yoon Seah beside him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you see those letters?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh? Letters on a black screen?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s concealed by the power of the Void, but take a closer look.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “With the power of the Void? Oh. Wait a sec. Inventory.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah took out her bow, drawing upon the energy of the Void she possessed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The energy felt certainly stronger than before.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘She’s gotten quite strong.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan noticed his niece’s growth, Yoon Seah summoned all her strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  She finally seemed to see the letters and was startled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It says ‘Video deleted by the owner of the Arena’? Wow, was this hidden text here all along?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. Without Void powers, you wouldn’t be able to see it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s amazing… Huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Yoon Seah looked curiously at the letters on the black screen, her eyes suddenly widened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mom’s asking if Uncle met with the owner of the Arena?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I did. He selected me as the Rookie of the Space Arena.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh… ‘The owner of the Arena. He is an absolute being who handles an axis of the Void cycle. I hope you didn’t offend him?’ she asks?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Arena owner – an absolute entity with that much weight in the Void?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan considered telling Seong Jiah about her potential liberation but thought,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s still too early.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If he tells her now, it’s clear she’ll just object saying there’s no need.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

 <p>
  And,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘More facts about Gilgamesh need to be uncovered first. Can’t reveal hostility without confirming he’s an enemy.’
 </p>
 <p>
  First impressions of the Arena owner cannot be fully trusted.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a situation where allies and enemies are indistinguishable, one must wait and watch.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, he brought up something else instead of discussing Gilgamesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why would I upset the owner of the Arena? He simply selected me as a rookie for the Space Arena?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Rookie? What’s good about being a rookie…? Ah. Mom says participating in the Arena is cheaper as a rookie.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Arena participation discounts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Is that all?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘For an Epic Quest reward, that’s pretty lackluster.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The reward is a 100-day reduction in being a Constellation Candidate and selection as the Rookie of the Space Arena.
 </p>
 <p>
  No tangible increase in power; rather, the true reward seemed to come from absorbing the Fire God and boosting the Red stat.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, Seong Jihan had believed there would be at least some peripheral benefits to the Epic Quest reward.
 </p>
 <p>
  But just a participation discount?
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s a bit stingy, isn’t it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mom’s asking how much is the Space Arena fee?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan checked the system window.
 </p>
 <p>
  There, a new Space Arena item had appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon opening the Space Arena item,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do you wish to participate in the Space Arena?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You are the Rookie of the Space Arena. You’ll receive rookie benefits.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Space Arena Rookie Benefits.]
 </p>
 <p>
  – A free use ticket granted every 100 days, exclusively for players.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  – A constant 30% participation fee discount.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  – One-time exemption from the defeat penalty, but the player will lose the rookie status if defeated.
 </p>
 <p>
  These details emerged in the message, revealing the rookie benefits.
 </p>
 <p>
  No stat or growth bonuses, simply benefits related to Arena participation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If they’re exclusively for players, I can’t sell them.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan initially questioned if these conditions were truly favorable, but then noticed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The participation fee is…100 billion GP?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Stunned by the cost, equal to the price of the Succubus Queen’s Palace of Pleasure entrance ticket.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even with a 30% discount, it’s 70 billion GP per game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Why is it so expensive?
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What’s the benefit of participating in the Arena?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It offers rapid growth. In some cases, you get special abilities. However, there’s a high chance of tough adversaries, so be cautious”
 </p>
 <p>
  Tough adversaries.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recalled the recent match.
 </p>
 <p>
  While each opponent was significant in their own worlds, They were simply consumed by Seong Jihan’s fire, insignificant foes.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘At least the remnants of the Fire God put up some resistance.’
 </p>
 <p>
  But even those were turned into abilities when it tried to consume Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Either way, the Arena’s opponents were just average game mobs to him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The opponents aren’t a burden, but the fee is.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, once possessing formidable wealth from pillaging the Thunder God’s GP,
 </p>
 <p>
  Didn’t have as much GP remaining after clearing out the Battle Market’s fire-attribute items to raise his Dragon Flame stat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll have to check out the Arena when the free pass arrives.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How much is the fee?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “100 billion GP.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…100 Billion GP?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. After the discount, it’s 70 billion.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s just go with the free pass, Uncle.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Reeling from the exorbitant fee, Yoon Seah quickly reached a conclusion.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded, closed the Space Arena window, and examined the newly added item below in the system.
 </p>
 <p>
  [BattleNet Community]
 </p>
 <p>
  Community – a function that had been locked since humanity belonged to the Bronze League.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now partially unlocked after clearing the 5th round of the Space Arena, Seong Jihan asked Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you have a community function in your system?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Open your system window.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t have it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Was the community function exclusive to him after clearing the Arena?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Might as well check it out.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan pressed on the BattleNet Community.

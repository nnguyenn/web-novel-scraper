  Chapter 293
 </p>
 <p>
  Three days later, at the World Tree Alliance Loan Counter.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hello.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re here again?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Just like before, Seong Jihan was commuting to the loan counter for the third consecutive day, having clicked on a forum pop-up ad.
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon seeing Seong Jihan wave his hand, the elf at the loan counter greeted him with a weary expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The branch manager did say you could come visit again, but… I never expected your visits to be this frequent.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I haven’t started playing the game yet. Came here for the fruit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who had ascended to the Master League through the promotion match held at the end of May.
 </p>
 <p>
  Until June arrived, he couldn’t play the game due to having risen in rank. Thus, during this interim period, Seong Jihan made sure to visit the loan counter every day.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The life force within me has significantly increased.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Although it wasn’t included in the stats on his status screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  The life force from the World Tree Alliance definitely existed within Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  And this energy significantly grew every time he ate the fruit given during consultations at the loan counter.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m sorry, but the branch manager has been away, and so it’s impossible to provide any more complimentary gifts.“
 </p>
 <p>
  The elf, a subordinate of the branch manager, informed Seong Jihan with a stiff tone that further gifts were not possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re the ones who told me to come often. So, you’ve stopped giving out complimentary gifts after just 3 days? Seems the generosity of World Tree elves is more limited than I thought.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Granting complimentary gifts to a player who has not provided personal information, especially on a continuous basis, is beyond our authority. Unless, of course, you’re willing to provide your personal information.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s fine, then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As much as the fruit basket had significantly increased his life force, Seong Jihan could not disclose his personal information to the World Tree Alliance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rejecting the offer, the elf seemed to have expected it, nodding in understanding.
 </p>
 <p>
  “In that case, any further distribution of complimentary gifts will not be possible until the branch manager returns.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “When will that be?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The loan counter isn’t operated from just this location. The branch manager oversees dozens of areas, so I cannot say when he will return.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If what the elf said was true, then it was a coincidence that he met him last time.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Can’t help it then.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Just when he thought he could comfortably increase his life force.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seems like continually growing through such means was indeed impossible.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That guy… Did he get the complimentary gifts without even registering his personal information?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “To just receive the fruit of the World Tree like that. What is he doing?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh. We had to pay interest of over 10 billion GP a month just for a chance to randomly receive it…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I want another one too!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile,
 </p>
 <p>
  Players waiting at the loan counter, having heard the conversation between Seong Jihan and the elf, began to express their dissatisfaction.
 </p>
 <p>
  The fruit of the World Tree was provided as a complimentary gift only during the first consultation.
 </p>
 <p>
  From then on, you had to pay over 10 billion GP a month in interest for a chance to randomly receive it. Even though some players had enough GP and wanted to buy it, the World Tree Alliance would never sell.
 </p>
 <p>
  And yet, how many times has that diminutive race player received it for free?
 </p>
 <p>
  “As you can see, the dissatisfaction among our existing customers is quite severe. Under these circumstances, another distribution of complimentary gifts without the branch manager’s approval is impossible.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan saw the players glaring menacingly at him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players of tremendous races, all eyes turned red over a piece of fruit, united in their agitation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It seems they change like that once tainted by the force mixed in the fruit and tea.’
 </p>
 <p>
  On the surface, they all looked like formidable challengers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players capable of ruling their own race should not be so disproportionately obsessed over the distribution of World Tree fruits.
 </p>
 <p>
  Were they addicted to the fruit due to being under the influence of its force?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well then, take care.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan smirked lightly, offering them a word before he logged out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘June 1st is almost here. Time surely flows strangely there.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The flow of time in the space of the loan counter was peculiar.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sometimes it was faster than on Earth, and other times slower.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now it was the night of May 31st, with about half an hour to spare.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should show my face around.’

 <p>
  Seong Jihan stepped out of the room.
 </p>
 <p>
  And there,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh. You are here, Jihan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He encountered Yoon Sejin, packed with loads of luggage and pulling a suitcase.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where are you going?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, I received a Constellation Quest. For a while, I’ll be touring domestically to search for the objects mentioned by the Constellation. During this time, I entrust Seah to you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Domestically?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked puzzled.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin’s Constellation was ‘The King of Humans’ Gilgamesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t clear why he was asked to explore the Korean Peninsula.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is the object you’re searching for?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m not sure myself. The message only mentioned relics.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A relic of the Korean Peninsula.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh, what could he be planning?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing Yoon Sejin appearing rushed, Seong Jihan just nodded for now.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood. Take care on your journey.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thanks.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Bye, Dad. Safe travels~”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yep, Seah. Listen to your uncle while I’m gone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If Uncle stays at home, sure.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Woosh! Woosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  After waving to Seong Jihan and Yoon Seah, Yoon Sejin hurriedly disappeared towards the entrance.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the middle of the night, why is he so hurried?
 </p>
 <p>
  “He could’ve left at dawn.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Exactly. Night driving is dangerous. Well, if it’s Dad, he should be fine even if there’s a car accident…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… Other than my sister’s issue, it’s the first time I’ve seen him in such a hurry.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Could it be because the number of people sponsored by ‘The King of Humans’ is increasing?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, already hundreds have verified it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ”…Hundreds?“
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. And it’s mostly top players. Nowadays, there’s talk that any player not sponsored by ‘The King of Humans’ is considered without potential.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With the Martial God gone and Gilgamesh taking his place, he was aggressively sponsoring players.
 </p>
 <p>
  A phenomenon that didn’t occur in his previous life when Gilgamesh hadn’t awakened.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I wish I had asked him when he was descended in brother-in-law. That’s unfortunate.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh, marked as a traitor by the Void.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then, the World Tree Alliance disclosed that a long time ago, a ‘critical error’ occurred on Earth through their actions.
 </p>
 <p>
  They collaborated with the Void to address the error, but were unable to recover any data, leaving only records behind.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan speculated there might be a connection with Gilgamesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘My ultimate enemy remains the Martial God. Unsure if he’s friend or foe for now. It’s premature to become adversarial without gathering more information.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the inevitable showdown over the Martial soul of the Martial God,
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh’s intentions were not clear enough yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  Regardless of his motives, Gilgamesh seemed friendly towards Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, if what the Void said was true – that humanity’s summoning was caused by Gilgamesh,
 </p>
 <p>
  then at some point, he would need to deal with that ‘cause.’…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Now is not the right time.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was impossible to consider him a foe under the current circumstances.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whatever motives Gilgamesh might have, Seong Jihan had to accept his favor for now.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I still need more growth.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Having become the top-ranked player among humanity and the first to enter the Master League,
 </p>
 <p>
  Even selected as a rookie in the Space Arena, Seong Jihan realized.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite this, the opponents he had to face were exceedingly powerful.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now that I’ve been promoted and the level limit has been lifted, it’s time to accelerate my level-up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, Uncle. It’s midnight.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright, let’s go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon Yoon Seah informing him of the time, Seong Jihan immediately logged into the game.
 </p>
 <p>

 <p>
  [You are among the top 1 percent of players in the Space-4 Area.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Through a special mission, you can ascend to the Space-3 Area.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Will you accept the special mission?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Space-4 Area.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even this zone, accessible only to the top 0.001 percent of players, couldn’t pose an obstacle for Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Claiming the top spot in every game and dominating the area,
 </p>
 <p>
  BattleNet was suggesting he move up to a higher level now that he had reached the Master League.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should take this.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With more experience points offered for advancing areas,
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a condition Seong Jihan, who was desperate for growth, couldn’t refuse.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he pressed yes,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Player has been assigned to the special defense map, ‘Northern Wall’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  He was allocated the special map ‘Northern Wall’.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Giant walls stand tall, behind which unknown entities invade.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Survive 10 days of battle and rank in the top 50 percent in defense performance.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Northern Wall map, true to its defense nature, seemed geared towards standing guard.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the top 50 percent performance requirement hinted it would be competitive with other players.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Normal maps often lead to clashes, but being a special map, this will likely encourage even more competition.’
 </p>
 <p>
  What needs defending might not only be unknown entities but other players as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as Seong Jihan was about to review the map’s details further,
 </p>
 <p>
  [You own a guild.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The mission can be attempted as a guild mission.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Choosing a guild mission offers additional rewards to the guild, with all guild members receiving extra benefits.]
 </p>
 <p>
  An additional option popped up.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A guild mission.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s Daegi guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aside from a few guild members, it was a development guild where world rankers came for growth, maintained in a business relationship with Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no moral obligation to choose the guild mission and bestow rewards upon them,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Considering the guild’s own bonus and the fact that the rankers are still much behind… It seems worthwhile.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Without him, humanity even lost to the Zojin Tribe. For Seong Jihan, the level of humanity’s rankers was another issue to tackle.
 </p>
 <p>
  If bringing them along for the guild mission could slightly improve their situation, so be it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The guild mission will likely be much harder than individual missions…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s Daegi guild was gathered purely for growth, having never even aligned their formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to other world guilds, they were sure to be significantly behind.
 </p>
 <p>
  Maybe even making it difficult to rank in the top 50 percent.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nonetheless, Seong Jihan decided to take the risk for the sake of guild rewards.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But, I can’t just give the rewards to the guild members for free.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Though unsure what the guild member rewards would be, being associated with ascending to Area 3 meant they would be valuable.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lately, having found more uses for GP, Seong Jihan decided to seize this opportunity to gather more.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is Hayeon asleep?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “She won’t be now. She just left our house after exercising a bit. She’s probably waiting for Uncle’s Master League matches. But why?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I got a guild mission. Need to discuss something.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A guild mission? There’s a thing like that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah’s eyes sparkled with curiosity.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it just now. It’s for ascending to Area 3.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t Uncle already moving up to Space 3 again? Ah, right… Since you’ve swept through Space 4 as well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah asked and understood by herself.
 </p>
 <p>
  “And there’s something grantable to guild members as a reward for the mission. It feels like a waste just giving it away.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course! If they can receive a reward from a mission you’re running, everyone will readily pay GP.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right. Need to think about the pricing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan immediately picked up his phone.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Oh, Boss. What brings you to call at this time? Ah… A guild mission? Really? I’ll come up right away!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, late into the night, the leadership of the Daegi guild gathered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Though the exact reward details haven’t been disclosed, given it’s Boss’s mission, it’ll definitely be substantial. We can mark up the GP price significantly. Let’s start with this minimum…”
 </p>
 <p>
  ”…Isn’t this too expensive?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, it’s Boss’s mission after all. This is quite cheap. Including an additional GP payment option based on the reward…”
 </p>
 <p>
  After discussing the pricing until dawn and notifying the guilds across the world,
 </p>
 <p>
  The next morning,
 </p>
 <p>
  The front pages of news outlets worldwide were adorned with the details of the guild mission Seong Jihan had received.

  Chapter 298
 </p>
 <p>
  The pure white gauntlet that came out of Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods.
 </p>
 <p>
  At a glance, it was exuding an intense energy.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There’s no item description or anything.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps because it wasn’t classified as an item in BattleNet, there was no particular explanation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Giving it to others seems risky, should I try equipping it?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The constellation fragment that had threatened Seong Jihan quite a bit, Since it came from that being, there was a risk in giving this object to other humans.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan brought his hand to the pure white gauntlet.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was an object whose size didn’t match a human hand, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  Swooosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan inserted his hand, it changed size to fit his hand and was sucked into him.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Martial God… If I had this, could I have beaten him?]
 </p>
 <p>
  A scene unfolded in Seong Jihan’s mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  The opponent he had just fought, with a head and 3 hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  The process and experience of that being ruminating on the battle it had with the Martial God, researching how it could have blocked his strike.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was indirectly experienced by Seong Jihan as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This… is really completely different from humans.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The original form of the constellation that fought Seong Jihan was an alien race with only an upper body and 6 arms attached.
 </p>
 <p>
  The way it handled its energy was on a different level from humans.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as humans cannot understand how to operate wings they don’t have, The power usage method of a constellation with 6 arms was also something Seong Jihan couldn’t relate to at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The characteristic of the Heterogeneous Martial Resolve class is activated.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Heterogeneous Martial Resolve that he had changed to before but never had a chance to use was activated here.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The authority of an extraterrestial race is researched and absorbed in a way suitable for your species.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [It is the authority of a constellation. You understand it only fragmentarily.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The incomprehensible power operation of six hands moving.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the Heterogeneous Martial Resolve made Seong Jihan understand this, even if only fragmentarily, in a way suitable for him.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Void increases by 5.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Martial Soul increases by 5.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Furthermore, while absorbing the power inside the gauntlet to fit his body, it raised the two stats by 5 each.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is quite a nice bonus.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Not only did his stats increase, but adapting the experience of using six arms to fit human combat was also a significant help. Although he hadn’t fully absorbed this experience yet, if he could make it his own, it would undoubtedly be quite helpful
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought while looking at his hand where the gauntlet had disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘When I used Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods on the Succubus Queen’s avatar before, there was no such effect… Is it because the opponent was constellation-grade? Then the constellation artifacts in Tuseong might have all been made this way too.’
 </p>
 <p>
  But then why was the Martial God just displaying those many constellation artifacts like stars in the sky?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan had that question, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  [You survived the longest in the final round of the Northern Wall.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Logging out from the Northern Wall to calculate the rewards for the entire guild.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As he was logged out of the game due to the end of the guild mission, he stopped thinking about this for now.
 </p>
 <p>
  Right now, it was time to organize the rewards from the end of the guild mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Special Defense Map, the Northern Wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though Seong Jihan could have chosen an individual mission here, he proceeded with the guild mission to aim for additional guild rewards.
 </p>
 <p>
  At first, the gap between the human rankers and Seong Jihan was so huge that it was doubtful if the mission could proceed smoothly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Octane’s information was useful.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks to the ‘Ability Sharing’ information provided by Lue Investment’s Octane, The Daegi Guild was able to reach the final round without much difficulty.
 </p>
 <p>
  And,
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’ve achieved 1st place in the guild mission.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’ve earned 10 guild points.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’ve obtained the guild-exclusive title, ‘Defender of the Northern Wall’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Seong Jihan couldn’t continuously bring buffs from the Resting Place of the Dead, Perhaps because the entire team survived for quite a while thanks to Ability Sharing, humanity took 1st place on the map.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition to earning 10 points, the Daegi Guild also gained a guild title.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Defender of the Northern Wall]
 </p>
 <p>
  – A title given to the guild that places 1st on the Northern Wall map.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  – Raises the level of all guild options by +5.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is quite useful.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Guild points that were extremely difficult to obtain normally.
 </p>
 <p>
  The guild mission supplemented this in one go and these rewards weren’t just applied to the Daegi Guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow, Uncle. I got +5 residual stats from participating this time!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. Other guild members got at least +3 as well. Plus, we gained a ton of experience points and leveled up… Everyone seems happy that they participated.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Given the favorable outcome, it seems like we could ask for additional GP as per the contract!”
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon, the guild master who had recruited rankers for the guild mission and received a certain amount of GP.
 </p>
 <p>
  She had agreed in the contract to receive additional GP if the rewards from the guild mission turned out to be more valuable than expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this enough to receive more money?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course! Do you know how hard it is to get residual stats!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even though it’s only +3 to +5?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s huge… Boss.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle… That remark is like a chaebol not knowing bus fare.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [TL/N: chaebol means a large family-owned business conglomerate.]
 </p>
 <p>
  For Seong Jihan, who had raised his stats by +10 just by absorbing a gauntlet, the value of residual points was hard to grasp.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah glared at Seong Jihan and asked, “Then what rewards did Uncle get from the mission?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “First, it’s focused on guild rewards. As for individual rewards…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan checked the final message.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You survived until the end in the guild mission.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your level increases by 10.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’ve obtained +10 residual points.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The rewards from this mission, reaching level 320 and gaining 10 residual points.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan spoke with a dissatisfied look.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Level +10, residual points +10. It’s mediocre.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…+10 is mediocre?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, I have been getting rewards from missions so far.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Every time he did a mission, an epic quest would pop up and give decent rewards.
 </p>
 <p>
  But this time, perhaps because that didn’t happen, he only received double the rewards compared to other players.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Guess I’ll raise my red stat with the residual points.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan dumped the residual points he received this time into the red stat, which had the lowest value.
 </p>
 <p>
  But when he invested 20, the red stat only increased by 1.
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering the point investment before, the unranked Red stat had a tremendously low investment efficiency.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It eats up a lot of points.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned as he looked at the Red stat that became 13.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the same for the other stats not increasing, but this one was a bit more severe.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I should go training.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Training? Don’t you have the group draw soon? Haven’t you seen it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What group draw?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The World Champions League.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, is it already that season?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Entering June, the rankings of regional leagues around the world had been decided. In the Northeast Asian League, Korea and China would participate in the World Champions League. In the group draw for the 32-team Champions League, four countries were selected for each group, forming eight groups.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Our country became the 1st seed. It’s the first time in history!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Note: Seed:- The player or team given the highest ranking in a seeded tournament, who has the most favourable draw.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, of course, since we won everything this year.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle, you sound a bit dull…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Since entering the main game on Battlenet, the significance of the Champions League has diminished.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s true. Everyone’s more focused on the Space League, after all.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon, who had come to the penthouse to report, nodded in agreement with Seong Jihan’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the past, the Champions League of BattleNet, the only sport for humanity, was a worldwide festival.
 </p>
 <p>
  But now, the Space League matches were taking its place in terms of topic.
 </p>
 <p>
  After all, the Champions League was about establishing a hierarchy between countries.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whereas the Space League had the fate of all humanity riding on the outcome of each match.
 </p>
 <p>
  The group drawing details that would have been featured in all media in the past.
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, it was sharing the news with the results of Seong Jihan’s guild mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, Uncle, are you going to skip watching and go train? We ordered pizza and chicken.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…You ordered that already?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you don’t order it two hours before the draw, it won’t arrive in time. Even though the Champions League’s popularity has declined, it’s still the top priority for entertainment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, Boss. Please eat and go. But what do you eat in the training room?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I just starve.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What, really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, now I don’t need to eat, it doesn’t affect me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ever since gaining the power of life force, Seong Jihan’s body had changed to the point where he didn’t need to eat anymore.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then you’ll continue starving in the training room? Aren’t you hungry now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright, I’ll eat before I go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He chuckled at Yoon Seah’s persistent persuasion and sat on the couch.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow, Boss. The guild’s option points suddenly increased a lot.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s because of the rewards from the guild mission.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The growth rate has increased dramatically… Shouldn’t we give more GP to the guild members?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We should. Due to the title, the number of members has increased, so please collect more GP.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it! I’ll make the arrangements.”
 </p>
 <p>
  While Lee Hayeon was encouraged by the greatly enhanced guild options and calling the Daegi Guild staff.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle, can I take a look at that cube from earlier?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Celestial Cube?”
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  “Yeah, it’s fascinating because it supposedly expands the limits of humanity.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan opened his inventory in response to Yoon Seah’s request. The Celestial Cube, which had become useless due to the lack of set limits for humanity, sat there, only the size of Seong Jihan’s palm.
 </p>
 <p>
  “On the outside, it just looks like a shiny cube…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah examined the cube on Seong Jihan’s hand from various angles.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then she tilted her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But… there’s a strange pattern here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Yoon Seah’s words, Seong Jihan examined the cube.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘She’s right.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the pattern wasn’t visible during the guild mission, it became slightly visible in the real world. While 90% was white, 10% had a subtle red tint.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm… I feel aura of Red from here.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan touched that pattern.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  The cube emitted a faint light, and the intense Red aura from the pattern began moving towards Seong Jihan’s chest.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although it was force from a small cube.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was much more intense than when he collected the remnant energy of the Fire God.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I won’t be able to take it all.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The red pattern was filled with power.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stat ‘Red’ increases by 1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red stat that increased by 1 when he invested over 20 residual points before, It increased by 1 more just by touching the cube.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  If the Red-filled force from the cube kept entering, rather than the stat increasing, his chest might have exploded.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the Celestial Cube kept the limit exactly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Did it have another function besides increasing the species’ limit?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks for raising the stat.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was looking at the white cube with a doubtful gaze.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  From the cracks of the cube’s pattern, a message window abruptly popped out.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Assigning a quest suitable for the user’s situation…]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s… giving a quest?’
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  = Champions League group stage draw for this year has begun!
 </p>
 <p>
  = Proudly, South Korea has been designated as the 1st seed this year! Seong Jihan’s role played the most significant part in this outcome!
 </p>
 <p>
  = The gambling odds for Champions League victory rank South Korea as the second highest, right after the USA! We’ve even surpassed China!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Champions League group drawing ceremony began.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah set up the delivered food just in time and said to Seong Jihan sitting on the sofa.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle, let’s eat first!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, yeah… But why did you order so much? Is someone else coming?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Four pizzas and five chickens.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan asked Yoon Seah while looking at the table full of food in front of the sofa.
 </p>
 <p>
  “A few of the unnis and Sophia are coming too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Still, isn’t it too much?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You have no idea how many calories players burn. They need to eat this much to survive.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah spoke as if it was obvious, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah, you can’t lie. Boss, Seah eats half of that by herself.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What, no way!! Unnie is no joke either! She told me to order the chicken!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The truth was quickly revealed by Lim Gayeong’s words as she came out of the training room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan laughed as he watched the two bickering.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Order more if it’s not enough. I’ll eat first.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He picked up a pizza and brought it to his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, in front of his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Assigning a quest suitable for the user’s situation…]
 </p>
 <p>
  The message that came out of the cube’s cracks a while ago kept… refreshing.
 </p>
 <p>
  At first, he was glad that it said it would give a quest.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If you’re not going to give it, just clear the message window, no?’
 </p>
 <p>
  It said it would give one, but even after more than an hour, the message window just stayed there.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned as he looked at the red message window that returned to the center even when he dragged it far away.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you’re going to give it, give it quickly, what a nuisance.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment,
 </p>
 <p>
  =Oh, South Korea is placed in Group B!
 </p>
 <p>
  =As the 2nd seed team… it’s… the UK!
 </p>
 <p>
  As South Korea was placed in Group B, the opponent countries were allocated one by one.
 </p>
 <p>
  …The message window that had been appearing finally changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [A quest suitable for the user will be given.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Win the Champions League.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Reward: Designated as a Constellation Candidate]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Winning the Champions League… This is the quest suitable for my situation?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan made a puzzled expression at the unexpected quest.

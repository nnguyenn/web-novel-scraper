  Chapter 302
 </p>
 <p>
  The Champions League Finals.
 </p>
 <p>
  For the first time, South Korea made it to the final, facing off against the United States, which had consistently reached the finals in almost every Champions League.
 </p>
 <p>
  Many people thought that the United States, with their superior strength, would once again claim victory. However, there was one variable.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is there no way to lift Seong Jihan’s bans just three times?
 </p>
 <p>
  -We had bad luck in the previous games, it’s time for some good fortune.
 </p>
 <p>
  -If Seong Jihan plays, we will definitely win!
 </p>
 <p>
  Ranked 1st in player rankings, Seong Jihan was undeniably the core of the South Korean team, even though he had only played one game due to bans in the tournament. Everyone acknowledged that if he played, no matter how strong the US team was, they would lose 100%.
 </p>
 <p>
  Therefore, BattleNet fans of all ages expected the US team to default to banning Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  But then…
 </p>
 <p>
  =What’s happening? Why aren’t they using the ban card on Seong Jihan?!
 </p>
 <p>
  =What is the coach thinking? Isn’t it basic to ban Seong Jihan in all 5 games?!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Instead, they choose to ban two players in the top 10…
 </p>
 <p>
  =Oh, Seong Jihan isn’t banned! Instead, it’s his teammate, the 2nd-ranked player in Korea, Sword King, who’s banned.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Coach, what on earth are you doing?
 </p>
 <p>
  The US commentators raised their voices, criticizing the coach’s incomprehensible decision.
 </p>
 <p>
  -What? Why no ban?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow, this is great LOL. Can we finally enjoy the 1st match without stress?
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the joy of the Korean fans was short-lived.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But… it always seems a constellation descends whenever Seong Jihan isn’t banned —
 </p>
 <p>
  -Right? Remember the Russia and Taiwan matches…
 </p>
 <p>
  -But we still won in the end. Those games were hilarious, haha.
 </p>
 <p>
  -I can’t relax until I see how the game unfolds.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan wasn’t banned, constellations would always pop up and drag the game in strange directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nervously, everyone watched the game’s progress.
 </p>
 <p>
  =The 1st match map is chosen as ‘Lone Bridge’!
 </p>
 <p>
  =A map where two sides clash over a bridge. Given its short length, the warrior’s strength is most crucial… and just when Seong Jihan wasn’t banned!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Truthfully, regardless of whether the map was short or large, facing Seong Jihan would always be difficult… but this does not look good. Why would the coach let him free?
 </p>
 <p>
  =Is there a hidden card up their sleeve against Seong Jihan?
 </p>
 <p>
  =Let’s hope so!
 </p>
 <p>
  With Seong Jihan’s ban lifted and the map selection seemingly favoring Korea, the 1st game started off positively for Korea.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the national team players remained tense despite the situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They wouldn’t just let Seong Jihan play without reason.’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There must be something they’ve prepared.’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Another constellation perhaps?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Assuming the opponent’s choice had a reliable plan behind it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Similarly, Seong Jihan thought,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Did Gilgamesh interfere somehow?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking this, as soon as he was summoned to Lone Bridge, he prepared himself fully.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not only did he gather all his strength, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sophia, can you give me a buff right now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course!”𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  With the divine buff from Sophia and his own strength at its peak, he looked across the bridge.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No need to approach, I’ll annihilate them from afar.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Suspecting Gilgamesh’s scheme within the US camp, There was no reason to play into their hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  The most crucial thing for Seong Jihan now was winning this game.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Though he said it was for humanity, he tried to brainwash, not convince me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Constellation Gilgamesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was fundamentally supportive of Seong Jihan, but it was more about treating him as a useful pawn in the long run rather than as a true ally.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if he was hostile to the Martial God, it didn’t necessarily mean he was on their side.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I will go all out from the start.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan took out the Phoenix Flag and threw it into the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  The spear, mixing the power of fire and lightning, disappeared into the heavens and then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Krrr…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Ripped a huge hole in the blue sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah, is that Seong’s Phoenix Spear…?!
 </p>
 <p>
  =It was so reliable in the Space League, but to be on the receiving end is terrifying!
 </p>
 <p>
  =The hole seems bigger than before!
 </p>
 <p>
  =But still, there must be a way to block it… since he was not banned, right?!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seen repeatedly through broadcasts, the Celestial Judgment, nicknamed ‘Phoenix Spear’ abroad, was the most visually memorable skill of Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though everyone expected the massive fissure to soon unleash a lightning spear,
 </p>
 <p>
  =Uh……
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  =Flames are spreading in the sky……?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s full-powered skill wasn’t the Celestial Judgment.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The edge of the huge circular hole pierced by the spear was engulfed in flames, and the sky filled with white flames in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, Crimson Thunder bloomed above it.
 </p>
 <p>
  The concentrated thermal energy of the sun focused on the fissure.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fundamental Martial Arts, Divine Dragon Decree – Celestial Dragon Thunder Fire
 </p>
 <p>
  The sky crumbled, bringing down intense flames like lightning bolts.
 </p>
 <p>
  The target was the US team’s camp.
 </p>
 <p>
  No, to be precise, the entire terrain across the bridge.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Is, is this… Dragon Breath?
 </p>
 <p>
  =Team USA! You have to block it!
 </p>
 <p>
  The U.S commentators screamed, urging the national team to respond, but even if they were considered the strongest national team in the world, there was no way to stop the flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  The world across the bridge, which was instantly dyed in white light, was engulfed in flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crimson Thunder streaked through, and then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The sturdy ‘Lone Bridge’ that connected the two lands was also quickly engulfed in flames and turned to dust and vanished.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Korean team across simply watched in awe.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The bridge is burning…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wasn’t this bridge unbreakable no matter how hard you hit it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is the bridge the issue right now? Look at the land over there.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…The ground itself has collapsed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The cliff on the other side where the US team based their camp was already being erased by the white flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  Everyone knew Seong Jihan was strong, but
 </p>
 <p>
  Could the game terrain be eradicated like that?
 </p>
 <p>
  “What… did you do, Uncle?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, who was pulling her bowstring ready to fight vigorously with Sophia’s buff,
 </p>
 <p>
  Stared dumbfounded at Seong Jihan as the enemy lines vanished before their eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  She had indeed grown mightily, facing accusations of cheating, But there was always someone flying above those running.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s power was growing leaps and bounds every time she saw him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I just swept them away before they could do anything funny on that side.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even against Team USA… that’s incredible.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Used my power to its fullest with a buff.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Celestial Dragon Thunder Fire,
 </p>
 <p>
  Recalling the sensation of being hit by the ‘First Breath’ of the Dragon Lord, this improved version of the Celestial Judgment was completed.
 </p>
 <p>
  It had fulfilled all conditions except the last piece of the puzzle until now.
 </p>
 <p>
  But,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Collecting videos in BattleNet was a help.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Collecting videos indiscriminately for the Heterogeneous Martial Resolve class,
 </p>
 <p>
  There were experiences of dragons and their allied races embedded in those recordings.
 </p>
 <p>
  After watching and feeling how they exerted their power… Seong Jihan surpassed Celestial Judgment, eventually harnessing the Dragon Lord’s power.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The problem is that my stats are insufficient, so once I use it, my energy is depleted.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Celestial Dragon Thunder Fire relied on the enemy’s power as its core, leaving Seong Jihan energy-drained.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the current state, he’d need to avoid fights until his energy recuperated.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  The US team wasn’t such a formidable foe.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The enemy has been annihilated.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Match 1 has ended.]
 </p>
 <p>
  With over half of the opponent’s cliff terrain deleted, there were no survivors left within it.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  =Unbelievable…
 </p>
 <p>
  =What in the world is going on?!
 </p>
 <p>
  =This is why you shouldn’t have let Seong play…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The first game ended as soon as it began, leaving the U.S commentators in shock and criticizing the coach’s decision for the first game.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, that was just the beginning.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Oh, come on, he’s still not banning him, even after that?
 </p>
 <p>
  =Is the coach out of his mind?!
 </p>
 <p>
  =F***!! What the hell is going on?!
 </p>
 <p>
  Entering the second game, the U.S coach still didn’t ban Seong Jihan. A furious caster couldn’t contain his anger and unleashed a string of curses.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Are the U.S commentators crazy? They’re cursing on a live broadcast, lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  -That’s how frustrated they are, lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But seriously, Seong Jihan is way too strong.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Didn’t that breath seem like a Dragon’s Breath?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yeah, it was even more powerful than a dragon’s.
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  -He deleted the game map, lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s Celestial Dragon Thunder Fire.
 </p>
 <p>
  Witnessing its overwhelming power, Korean viewers were exhilarated, acknowledging Seong Jihan’s might.
 </p>
 <p>
  And as Seong Jihan wasn’t banned again for the 2nd match,
 </p>
 <p>
  Some even speculated that this might be the moment they would witness Korea’s first championship victory.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the other hand,
 </p>
 <p>
  =Why isn’t the coach selecting the map?
 </p>
 <p>
  =Did he just lose his mind? Why bother unbanning if he’s going to waste the bans like this?
 </p>
 <p>
  =Shouldn’t the staff intervene? How can they just stand by and watch this?!
 </p>
 <p>
  The U.S commentators erupted, suggesting that the staff should intervene, but the game proceeded as usual.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah… the game will continue as is. The map is South Gate.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Oh no! South Gate! If Seong Jihan uses his breath attack on this map, it’s game over!
 </p>
 <p>
  =He should have at least chosen the map wisely. This is insane! What are they even doing?!
 </p>
 <p>
  The second match proceeded unchanged. With Seong Jihan still in play and the advantageous map of South Gate, it seemed like the US national team had given up on the game altogether.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why is the U.S team acting like this?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Are they trying to hand the victory to Korea?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Well… we’ll gladly accept it ^^
 </p>
 <p>
  Though the Korean viewers couldn’t understand English, the sentiment of gratitude was predominant.
 </p>
 <p>
  -F***! Even a seven-year-old kid could manage bans and map selects better than this!!
 </p>
 <p>
  -My seven-year-old son is throwing a fit at home. He’s crying, asking why Seong Jihan isn’t banned and why they didn’t select the Mage map!
 </p>
 <p>
  -Let’s send that kid to be the coach.
 </p>
 <p>
  -That would be better. What a mess is this?
 </p>
 <p>
  The U.S viewers were in chaos, flooding the chat with curses and complaints.
 </p>
 <p>
  The outcome of the second game was as expected by everyone.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Aaargh!!
 </p>
 <p>
  =South Gate is crumbling!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Another breath erupted! The entire castle is disappearing…
 </p>
 <p>
  =Heh… haha! The U.S is going to lose 3-0 for the first time in the finals.
 </p>
 <p>
  The U.S commentators screamed in agony, and the second game was just as one-sided as the first. When Seong Jihan threw his spear into the sky, it descended like a dragon’s breath. The fortress vanished into dust along with the US national team. The Korean team had already taken a 2-0 lead in the finals.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, if they just get one more win, the championship is within reach.
 </p>
 <p>
  =What on earth is going on?!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Why didn’t they select maps for the first and second matches?! Does U.S think they’re the World Tree Elves?
 </p>
 <p>
  =Uh… huh? The third match. Is he finally going to ban Seong Jihan?
 </p>
 <p>
  = The Coach. Has he finally come to his senses?!
 </p>
 <p>
  =W-well, as long as he bans Seong Jihan, there’s a chance!
 </p>
 <p>
  From the third match onwards, the US national team’s strategy was back on track. They banned the overwhelmingly powerful player, Seong Jihan, employing a strategy known even to a seven-year-old: competing among human players without Seong Jihan’s domination.
 </p>
 <p>
  =But why… isn’t he selecting the map?
 </p>
 <p>
  =It’s okay! At least he banned Seong Jihan!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Hmm… Is he saving their map selecting card for the 5th match, thinking they’re World Tree Elves?
 </p>
 <p>
  =Well, who knows! I don’t understand why he’s doing this, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  As they entered the third match, the US national team showed a completely different side compared to the first two matches. The match was completely dominated by the US from start to finish.
 </p>
 <p>
  =T-the United States. They win!
 </p>
 <p>
  =It starts from the third match. They just need to turn things around now!
 </p>
 <p>
  =If Seong Jihan is banned again in the 4th match… It’ll come down to a 50% chance in the 5th match!
 </p>
 <p>
  And the 4th match proceeded as the US commentators hoped.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was banned, and the US team overpowered Team Korea.
 </p>
 <p>
  Continuing their momentum from the 3rd match , the 4th match was also a crushing victory for the US.
 </p>
 <p>
  -US is damn strong…
 </p>
 <p>
  -I guess it’s tough without Seong Jihan —
 </p>
 <p>
  -True, getting here was a miracle.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Sword King’s movement in the 4th match was disappointing… he played too aggressively…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ah, so it comes down to the 5th match. It’s all about luck now?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Will the final game be decided by mere chance?
 </p>
 <p>
  With the score tied at 2-2, Korea and the US entered the final game. People naturally expected Seong Jihan to be banned again at this point.
 </p>
 <p>
  But…
 </p>
 <p>
  =Coach!! Why! Why aren’t you banning him again?!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Have you really lost your mind?!
 </p>
 <p>
  To everyone’s surprise, the US coach didn’t ban Seong Jihan at the last moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s going on?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why would he do that, seriously?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even the Korean national team players couldn’t understand the opponent’s strategy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as people were scratching their heads in confusion…
 </p>
 <p>
  =Oh, but wait, Look at the coach. Suddenly, he’s gathering the select cards to designate a map…
 </p>
 <p>
  =It’s like he was waiting to choose the map!
 </p>
 <p>
  =The map name is… ‘Tuseong’…
 </p>
 <p>
  The US coach decisively chose the game map ‘Tuseong’.

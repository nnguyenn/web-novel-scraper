  Chapter 305
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why do you think that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh, possessing Yoon Sejin’s body, stopped laughing and asked Seong Jihan with a serious expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The fruits and leaves earlier were from the World Tree. Though their performance is much inferior.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Inferior performance… How lacking did you find them?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “About ⅕ of the real deal?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…That’s all, huh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh frowned at Seong Jihan’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  “And your answer to my question?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Your guess is correct.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He affirmed that the Tower of Babel was indeed related to the World Tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then the power of the Annihilation God’s Secret, Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit, is also ultimately connected to the World Tree.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Heh… You’ll find out when you reach the rooftop. However…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Step! Step!
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh turned his back and climbed the stairs.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Unlike other races, the martial arts of the Martial God could not contain all of my power. Your martial arts are but half of my power.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so? Thanks for the kind explanation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you make it to the top, you can learn more.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh kept urging him to climb to the very top.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You must be hiding something on the rooftop.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hoho, are you afraid? If you’re scared, you can log out. I don’t mind if you come up or not.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, but I need to win the championship.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I knew you’d answer like that. Then see you at the top…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  A golden light shot up from Yoon Sejin’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  His movements paused for a moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Did he come and go?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, let’s go up. He’s waiting at the top.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The King Of Humans who turned all of humanity’s rankers into his fanatics.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whatever he had prepared on the rooftop, it was bound to be extraordinary.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to be fully prepared.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the remaining time of the buff Sophia had cast on him.
 </p>
 <p>
  About 15 minutes left on the buff’s duration.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before it ends, he has to reach the rooftop.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll go on ahead.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “O-oh, okay?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, the rest of you can follow slowly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mr. S-Seong Jihan… Then the king’s gifts…”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s words, one of the national team players asked with greedy eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though Seong Jihan said he would go alone, rather than worrying about him, the players were only interested in the gifts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though eating too much would turn them into chains and disappear, their greed showed no signs of abating.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You can all have them as you please. I won’t eat and will go ahead.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan glanced at the national team players, then climbed the Tower of Babel first.
 </p>
 <p>
  The next floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Pay respects to the king and consume the branch. Then you may ascend to the next floor.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “No time for that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan found a gap between the steel giants blocking his way and broke through.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clank! Clank!
 </p>
 <p>
  Chains shot out from the steel giant’s body to stop him, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  [Let him pass.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the steel giant’s eyes flashed gold, the extending chains retracted.
 </p>
 <p>
  With nothing blocking his way, Seong Jihan quickly climbed the tower.
 </p>
 <p>
  After ascending several floors like that,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This floor looks a bit different from the others.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike the previous floors of the Tower of Babel that were filled with a golden glow.
 </p>
 <p>
  A floor dyed completely in a bloody hue was revealed before Seong Jihan’s eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  There stood a single steel giant, Enkidu.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike the other Enkidus, he wore blood-red armor and was tightly bound by golden chains extending from the walls, floor, and ceiling.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  [Who are you?]
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan entered, he emitted a red light from the two eyes in his helmet.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Definitely a distinct and powerful being compared to the Enkidus so far. But that power feels familiar somehow…’
 </p>
 <p>
  While thinking that, Seong Jihan looked for stairs to reach the rooftop before the buff ended, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  “There are no stairs here.”
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  Do I have to defeat the being in front of me to go up?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  If I tangle with that formidable being here, the buff might end. Should I just pierce through the ceiling and go?
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan thought that and looked at the ceiling.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Seong Jihan… I don’t know how you got here, but…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Blood gathered behind the steel giant who recognized Seong Jihan, and a huge iron blood cross was formed.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the cross-shaped blood cross he had seen before in the Russia match.
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you want to fight, I’ll take you on.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You… are Longinus?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s right.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The blood-red giant affirmed Seong Jihan’s question.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile,
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah, Seong Jihan definitely asked Yoon Sejin if he was Gilgamesh, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  =Yes. I never imagined the identity of the ‘King Of Humans’ would be the ancient king Gilgamesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  =If he’s a constellation, there might be more constellations among ancient figures!
 </p>
 <p>
  The conversation between Seong Jihan and Yoon Sejin was broadcasted on the screen for all to see.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the 5th match, where both the US and Korean national teams had already become a cult worshiping the King of Humans.
 </p>
 <p>
  The only thing worth broadcasting now was Seong Jihan’s side, the only sane one.
 </p>
 <p>
  The camera had been focused solely on Seong Jihan for a while now.
 </p>
 <p>
  And through this, people around the world learned the identity of the King Of Humans.
 </p>
 <p>
  -‘The King Of Humans’ is Gilgamesh…
 </p>
 <p>
  -But even if Gilgamesh is an ancient king, calling him king of humans is a bit much, no?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Everyone, Egypt had the first monarchy.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But what’s this about the Tower of Babel thing related to the World Tree?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Don’t know; Were the World Tree Alliance and humanity connected?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Turns out the lowest-ranked race had a hidden secret…
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers made various speculations about the sudden revelation.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But that giant is Longinus?
 </p>
 <p>
  -The Longinus who pierced Jesus?
 </p>
 <p>
  -But that iron blood cross, it’s the one Vladimir summoned in the Russia match. He said it was because his constellation descended…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Then Longinus is also a constellation? Why are there so many human-born constellations?
 </p>
 <p>
  -I know, right;
 </p>
 <p>
  When the identity of the blood-red giant was revealed to be Longinus, they fell into confusion.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why are you inside that giant?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I’m recovering my strength with Gilgamesh’s help. I need to descend to Earth as soon as possible to kill you directly.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the golden chains binding Longinus at those words.
 </p>
 <p>
  A considerable amount of life force was flowing into the red giant through them.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so? If I disrupt your recovery here, I’ll buy more time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Disrupt…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  In those words, the blood cross that was flying on its own behind the giant.
 </p>
 <p>
  It came down heavily between Seong Jihan and Longinus.
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you want to try, go ahead.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  Blood splattered everywhere, and the blood cross instantly split into hundreds of swords.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each one carried quite an intense force.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  Fundamental Divine Arts, Heavenly Dragon Thunder Fire – Dragon Thunder
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle…!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Dragon Thunder imbued with the power of fire swept the swords, the blood crosses began to evaporate instantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  But as the blood crosses evaporated, they multiplied again eventually blocking the Dragon Thunder.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first attack didn’t go through like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I attack a few more times, I can definitely deal damage.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With that first clash, Seong Jihan grasped the opponent’s strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he fired the Dragon Thunder a few more times.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  The blood crosses were finally pierced through, and the Dragon Thunder reached the blood-red giant’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You bastard… You’ve grown even more.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The blood-red giant was engulfed in flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  But as the golden chains binding his body wriggled.
 </p>
 <p>
  The giant’s body was quickly restored.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if the Dragon Thunder dealt some damage, Longinus immediately recovered with the power of the chains.
 </p>
 <p>
  [But no matter how strong you become, you can’t disrupt my recovery to that extent.]
 </p>
 <p>
  He looked at his restored body and spoke to Seong Jihan with confidence.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What confidence do you have while getting beaten one-sidedly?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hah, it’s only because I can’t move my body due to the chains. If these chains were released, I could kill the likes of you in an instant.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so?”
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  [That’s right. However, I’m only bound to recover my strength… Killing you in this space has no meaning anyway.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather than killing Seong Jihan in virtual space.
 </p>
 <p>
  Longinus would recover his strength, descend to Earth, and then surely exterminate Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I use the Destruction code, Destroy, I can definitely deal a blow to him.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The most powerful technique Seong Jihan could use right now was the Destruction code.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he used it on Longinus, he could certainly inflict devastating damage on him.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I do that, I’ll have no energy left to use at the top floor.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even for the grown Seong Jihan, writing a single character of the Destruction code was taxing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although he had Sophia’s buff now, writing one character wouldn’t leave him in a groggy state like before.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, he wouldn’t have enough stamina left to write it here and then again at the top floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  He could only use the Destruction code once.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Using the Destruction code here to damage Longinus and then logging out is one way…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The most pressing issue for Seong Jihan right now was Longinus, who would descend to Earth.
 </p>
 <p>
  This constellation with the Spear of Judgment was a threatening existence no matter how powerful Seong Jihan became.
 </p>
 <p>
  So originally, he had planned to lead the 5th match to victory and become a constellation candidate to prepare for him.
 </p>
 <p>
  But blocking Longinus’ recovery with the Destruction code here and logging out was also a method.
 </p>
 <p>
  By doing this, even if he couldn’t immediately become a constellation candidate.
 </p>
 <p>
  He could delay Longinus’ descent to Earth and ascend to candidacy during that time.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Even if it doesn’t work this time, I’ll soon become a candidate anyway.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Becoming a constellation candidate, which didn’t have much time left.
 </p>
 <p>
  It would be best to win this match and be selected as a candidate right away.
 </p>
 <p>
  But this second option of damaging Longinus was also a path in its own way.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, with this method.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I don’t have to go to the top floor.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The top floor of the Tower of Babel, where Gilgamesh might be hiding some scheme.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather than setting foot there, Damaging Longinus here and returning to Earth might be the safer option.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was contemplating what to do for a moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  [What are you doing? Not attacking… anymore?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Longinus, who was bound by the golden chains, threw a question at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why? Do you want to get hit?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I can take that petty attack as much as I want.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, is that so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Longinus provoked him, saying he would gladly take the hits.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the opponent coming at him like that, Seong Jihan passed on the second method for now.
 </p>
 <p>
  Come to think of it, the idea that damaging the chained Longinus would slow his recovery was just a judgment based on his words.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether it would actually harm the constellation’s main body was, in fact, unknown.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I won’t hit you if you call it petty.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […Ha. Is that so?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, where’s the way up?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I don’t know either.]
 </p>
 <p>
  While saying that, the eyes of the blood-red armor flashed red, looking behind Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  [He would know.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Step! Step!
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as he finished speaking, Yoon Sejin climbed the stairs.
 </p>
 <p>
  His eyes were now filled with a golden light, not even trying to hide it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan. You’re cautious. But that Longinus is a gift for you, whom I favor… Damage him here and delay his recovery.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why? If you favor me, you don’t have to help him recover.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hoho, I can’t harm a fellow race… It’s a stage set up for you to handle him directly. If you strike him here, his descent will be delayed quite a bit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh blatantly told him to quickly deal with Longinus.
 </p>
 <p>
  He added.
 </p>
 <p>
  “When he has taken appropriate damage. I will create stairs leading to the top floor.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That damn top floor… When will it appear?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re almost there. It’s right above.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin’s finger pointed straight up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just one more floor to the top.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can’t go if I don’t handle him?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right. You should accept the gift, shouldn’t you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I see…”
 </p>
 <p>
  To Gilgamesh, who said he would only open the way if Longinus was definitely damaged.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan smiled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then I’ll go up on my own.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan dashed towards the ceiling.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Pointless act. The paths inside here won’t open without my permission.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh saw that and scoffed, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  As tremendous energy gushed out from Seong Jihan’s body, characters were drawn on the blood-red ceiling.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You, what the hell are you doing…”
 </p>
 <p>
  For the first time, his expression stiffened.

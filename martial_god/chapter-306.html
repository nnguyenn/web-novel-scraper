  Chapter 306
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan used all his strength to write just one character but its aftermath was beyond imagination.
 </p>
 <p>
  The golden ceiling instantly lost its light.
 </p>
 <p>
  It quickly turned into a black space and disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  And
 </p>
 <p>
  “No…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t just the ceiling where the character was written that disappeared, the golden chains binding Longinus, the walls and floor of this level, as if the destruction was contagious, they all turned into a black space in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This, this power… Is it the power of destruction possessed by the Spear of Judgment? How did you already…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh looked at the disappearing space with a surprised expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  He stood on twin swords instead of his feet that had no place to stand and asked Seong Jihan in a trembling voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You said you were trying to go to the rooftop, but it’s gone, isn’t it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Answer my question!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why should I?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan scoffed at the agitated Gilgamesh and looked up again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Above the vanished ceiling was the sky of Tuseong that he had seen before.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just like that world where the constellations’ weapons floated like stars in the darkness resembling the universe, Numerous weapons were floating in the sky, but unlike the real Tuseong, the power of constellations wasn’t felt from there.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since this was a virtual world, they probably didn’t implement the constellations’ power.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This was the top floor of this tower from the beginning.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is the primordial treasure?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The dungeon map Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  The victory condition of this map was to reach the end of the tower first and claim the primordial treasure.
 </p>
 <p>
  They had already reached the top floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, if they just claim the primordial treasure, they would win the 5th match.
 </p>
 <p>
  The one who answered Seong Jihan’s question was.
 </p>
 <p>
  [How did you use the power of the Spear of Judgment… If you answer this question, I will tell you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Longinus, who had been quietly looking at the ceiling in the state of a blood-red steel giant.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you even know?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I know. If by chance the item I know isn’t the ‘primordial treasure’, I promise not to kill you when I descend to Earth.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A promise, huh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  How can I trust the words of these guys?
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can use my power without permission like you. So I did some research. Getting pierced by your Spear of Judgment last time was a big help.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He spoke only superficially, leaving out the core.
 </p>
 <p>
  [That research has already borne fruit… In this short time?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I can’t believe it…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then don’t believe it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […Okay. It’s really hard to believe. Release me, Gilgamesh. I need to fight him and take that attack myself.]
 </p>
 <p>
  At that, Longinus stepped up to fight Seong Jihan rather than talking about the primordial treasure.
 </p>
 <p>
  But Gilgamesh shook his head at him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s already too late.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [What? Why?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “His power directly hit the entire tower. In this state, I can no longer maintain this virtual space.”
 </p>
 <p>
  While saying that, Gilgamesh pointed his finger downward.
 </p>
 <p>
  There, the towering golden tower was seen disappearing in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  [No… With just one pattern written on the ceiling?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “That is the power possessed by the authority of destruction.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […Ha.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  As Longinus sighed, the chains binding him loosened.
 </p>
 <p>
  The body of the steel giant also gradually became transparent and disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  The chains that had restrained him but also helped maintain his existence in this space.
 </p>
 <p>
  As they disappeared, Longinus’ existence was naturally expelled from here.
 </p>
 <p>
  And
 </p>
 <p>
  Where the golden chains and Longinus had all disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  A huge sphere wrapped tightly in pure white bandages floated up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The primordial treasure is there.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That thing?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. If you become its owner, you will win. The Korean national team will be victorious. However, if you fail to become the owner… The victory will go to the United States.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At those words, Seong Jihan looked down.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There are no survivors though?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you mean there’s none?”
 </p>
 <p>
  At those words, Gilgamesh reached out his hand toward the huge sphere.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whirl…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, something extended from inside it.
 </p>
 <p>
  At first, I thought it was the golden chains Gilgamesh had been using.
 </p>

 <p>
  =Uh… what is this? There are people twisted together… Only the face at the very end is properly revealed.
 </p>
 <p>
  =This, this person. It’s Oliver! He had disappeared earlier, transforming into a golden chain…
 </p>
 <p>
  =I was wondering why he wasn’t processed as dead, so he was here, huh!!
 </p>
 <p>
  What came out of the sphere was a human rope with only the head intact.
 </p>
 <p>
  The whole body was twisted, leaving only the head.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ah, I thought the match was going to end with Korea’s victory, but what is that?
 </p>
 <p>
  -It looks like just a rope with a head attached.
 </p>
 <p>
  -If you look closely at the rope, it feels like flesh is wriggling… If you zoom in, you can see more…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ah, don’t look at such things closely😨
 </p>
 <p>
  -The expression also looks like he’s on drugs. Why does he look so ecstatic;
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t just Oliver who came out as a human rope like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Heh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Not only Americans but the Korean national team players were also popping out as ropes with only their heads left, with a dazed expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Like this, the entire national team survived. Rather, your Korean team is at a numerical disadvantage thanks to the two who logged out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are those who turned into ropes like that also survivors?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course. Rather, they will be rejoicing in the most vigorous vitality of their lives.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  While saying that, Gilgamesh raised his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you take that, the game ends. But even you find that suspicious, don’t you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, it looks so unpleasant that I don’t want to touch it, even if it’s a one-dimensional trap.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you answer my earlier question, I will process it nicely for you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What? About the power of destruction?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What I told Longinus earlier is all there is to it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s words lacking substance, Gilgamesh raised the corner of his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “As expected, you won’t obediently listen… I have no choice but to use force.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Didn’t you say you can’t maintain the virtual space any longer?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, without the host Longinus, I couldn’t maintain the existing tower…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  While saying that, Gilgamesh pointed his finger at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But there’s a new host to stay in right here, isn’t there.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Don’t tell me, you mean me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Try surpassing my authority like Longinus’ for once.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  Human ropes extending from the bandages towards Seong Jihan all at once.
 </p>
 <p>
  “My authority is the World Tree itself.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing that, he continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is merely the roots.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aaaah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan! You too… Come here!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s be together!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Korean-American national team players who turned into ropes and flew towards Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  The commentators couldn’t hide their shock at the sight.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah… what is this..?
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ba-Barren is at the forefront, trying to bite Seong Jihan!CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
 </p>
 <p>
  =To think the final match of the finals would proceed like this…
 </p>
 <p>
  The last match, which was expected to be a fierce competition.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the King of Humans appeared, it proceeded strangely, and in the end, it showed all the players being ruined.
 </p>
 <p>
  -It’s like ghosts with only faces are chasing him…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ah, Ha yeonjoo is there too
 </p>
 <p>
  -Can’t they just give Korea the victory and end the match? Seeing my idols transformed like that breaks my heart, I can’t watch.
 </p>
 <p>
  -They will return to normal after this match ends, right…?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Isn’t Seong Jihan hesitating to respond properly because of misplaced camaraderie?
 </p>
 <p>
  As the rankers who dominated the world became like that, a considerable number of viewers said they couldn’t bear to watch and turned off the TV.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some people were worried that Seong Jihan might not be able to deal with them decisively after seeing them.
 </p>
 <p>
  But
 </p>
 <p>
  “Annoying.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Slash!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan cut off their heads with a single stroke.
 </p>
 <p>
  He mercilessly sliced off the heads of the Korean national team members who were his allies.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even with the faces of comrades, there is no hesitation in the movement of your sword. A good attitude.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh was approvingly evaluating Seong Jihan’s sword from behind.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The same goes for you, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Fundamental Divine Arts, Heavenly Dragon Thunder Fire – Dragon Thunder
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s Phoenix Flag poured Dragon Thunder towards Gilgamesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Zap!
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, Yoon Sejin’s body lifted the twin swords supporting his feet to block the Dragon Thunder.
 </p>
 <p>
  He raised the corner of his mouth at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Heh. Wasn’t this body your brother-in-law?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s fine, I wanted to kill you second after Shizuru before.”
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  While saying that, Seong Jihan attacked mercilessly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang! Clang!
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin’s twin swords moved quite nimbly and blocked Seong Jihan’s attacks a few times.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmph…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Slash!
 </p>
 <p>
  But the difference between the two was already stark.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s spear cut off Yoon Sejin’s right arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  And soon after, it pierced his heart and head twice with the spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  And as fire erupted from the spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin’s body quickly burned and disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Camaraderie, my ass…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Merciless, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yoon Sejin lacked proper discipline back when he was the Japanese Sword King
 </p>
 <p>
  -It was annoying how he was possessed by Gilgamesh and chattering next to him, but how he’s getting crushed by him just like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers who thought Seong Jihan might hesitate cheered at his merciless strike.
 </p>
 <p>
  And Seong Jihan, who dealt with Yoon Sejin behind him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s… be together…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  While cutting off the regenerating heads, he focused his firepower on the bandaged sphere.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fundamental Divine Arts, Heavenly Dragon Thunder Fire – Dragon Thunder
 </p>
 <p>
  The Phoenix Flag shot towards the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  It soon created a huge fissure and poured out intense flames from it.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon’s Breath that swept away the US national team along with the terrain in 1st and 2nd match.
 </p>
 <p>
  That intense firepower was concentrated on a single entity.
 </p>
 <p>
  The bandaged sphere.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The bandaged sphere was quickly engulfed in flames and disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is it over?
 </p>
 <p>
  -That was creepy for a final match, really 😥
 </p>
 <p>
  When people expected the bandaged sphere directly hit by the Dragon’s Breath to have disappeared like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  Slither! Slither!
 </p>
 <p>
  Bandages were generated in the air and began to wrap into a spherical shape again.
 </p>
 <p>
  [What intense firepower. But without that power, it won’t end.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The bandages that seemed to have completely disappeared came back to life again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  After all, these things related to the World Tree are all immortal.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It feels like it’s telling me to keep using the Destruction code.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If it wants to be hit so blatantly like that, it’s usually a trap.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, he had used the Destruction code earlier, and it was too much to use it again.
 </p>
 <p>
  A little while ago, he was at least in a buffed state, so the power didn’t make him groggy.
 </p>
 <p>
  But now, most of the buff effects have disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Destruction code shouldn’t be used unless he was absolutely certain.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come in…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Zap!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan poured Dragon Thunder on Barren’s head, which was reaching out towards him again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then he looked around once more.
 </p>
 <p>
  The map that had turned completely black after the Tower of Babel disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the night sky far away, where the constellations’ weapons were floating, remained unaffected by the power of the Destruction code.
 </p>
 <p>
  The constellations’ weapons that seemed to be just decorations, with no energy felt from them.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Oh, but…’
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Seong Jihan felt something strange about the constellation of those weapons.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like the number had decreased by one compared to when he saw it a little while ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stop resisting and join us. This is all for you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh conveyed his intentions through the faces of the national team players.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how much he killed them, they remained vigorous.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at them for a moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  He turned his head and flew up into the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where are you going!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s be together!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Then the heads of the players followed Seong Jihan all at once.
 </p>
 <p>
  But Seong Jihan ignored them and didn’t stop ascending into the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  And
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…24 weapons. I feel the life force from one of them.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the constellations’ weapons adorning the sky, he discovered one weapon that contained the life force.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a small dagger.
 </p>
 <p>
  A weapon that was hidden by the presence of other weapons and couldn’t be seen from below.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan reached out to it.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have obtained the primordial treasure.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The match will end.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The match end message suddenly appeared.

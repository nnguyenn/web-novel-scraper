  Chapter 308
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the World Tree root strand where he was pulled in reverse after using the Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a pitch-black space where not a single ray of light entered.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The chains of the Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit have disappeared… But I can’t move my body.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With the energy in his body gone and unable to move a muscle, he could only see and hear in this dark space.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  A green light appeared far away.
 </p>
 <p>
  It soon swirled and became a huge vortex.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What is that?’
 </p>
 <p>
  As he watched for a moment, wondering what it was.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  In the center of the vortex, a red light flashed.
 </p>
 <p>
  It soon gathered into a circular shape and moved like an eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Put them in.]
 </p>
 <p>
  From within that red dot, a language Seong Jihan had never heard before resounded.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a language he had never heard before, but strangely, he could understand the meaning of the other party’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  As his words ended like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud! Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  From above, something began to fall.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…They’re people, aren’t they?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The hundreds of people fell from above.
 </p>
 <p>
  Men and women, young and old, of various genders and age groups, looked around with trembling eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “*##$!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “#[email protected]$…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who could understand the words of the red eye but couldn’t understand a single word of the humans who fell here.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some of the people walked towards where Seong Jihan was.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  They passed right through where he was.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm… Is this perhaps an illusion.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The people who neither perceived nor collided with Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  He decided to observe the situation for now.
 </p>
 <p>
  And before long,
 </p>
 <p>
  [I brought some too.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Another green vortex appeared from the other side.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud! Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  About a hundred more people fell inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  And when this process was repeated 3 more times.
 </p>
 <p>
  About 500 people were trapped in this space of darkness.
 </p>
 <p>
  “@[email protected]!#!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “@#*…”
 </p>
 <p>
  As 500 people gathered together and were confused like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  [500 have gathered.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Begin the experiment.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The red eyes in the vortex that reached the target number flashed all at once.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Drip! Drip…
 </p>
 <p>
  Red liquid fell drop by drop from above and touched where the people were.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sizzle…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The people hit by those droplets had their bodies burn and instantly turned to ashes and disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “^Percent[email protected]$!!”
 </p>
 <p>
  To avoid being touched by the red liquid, people ran in all directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the droplets that fell one by one soon rained down like rain and touched all 500 people.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, the people quickly disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Only Seong Jihan could observe this unaffected inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  [Is this the price of erasing the limit?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The price of removing the limit is gruesome. How can they be so weak?]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They removed the limit?’
 </p>
 <p>
  At those words, Seong Jihan recalled the Celestial Cube.
 </p>
 <p>
  The item that increased the limit of the race didn’t work on humans.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Instead of abolishing the limit setting, how about just increasing it? And making the basic foundation of the species sturdy.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Then it’s meaningless. They will eventually reach the set limit anyway.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [But with such a frail race, isn’t the experiment a failure? They can’t even endure a single drop of the root’s sap.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s too early to determine the experiment a failure. Let’s continue.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The vortexes disappeared and the experiment resumed again.
 </p>
 <p>
  How many times did hundreds of people pour in and burn up and disappear in the red liquid?
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The people who used to turn to ashes instantly began to endure the flames to some extent.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aaaah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Accordingly, the cases of screams erupting from all directions also increased.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘From the experimenters’ perspective, it must have been more comfortable when they died in one hit.’
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Compared to when they instantly burned up upon contact with a single drop, the time of suffering only increased for humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, the experiment that started with 500 people gradually increased in scale.
 </p>
 <p>
  [If we put in more, they’ll die from being crushed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [If they die from that, they’re useless experimental subjects anyway. Put in more.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Right. we are wasting sap here.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Later, thousands to over 10,000 people poured in at once.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the dark space seemed to have no visible limits from the outside.
 </p>
 <p>
  As people poured in in droves, humanity was blocked at a certain point and couldn’t spread out any further.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lumped together and crushed in a huge container.
 </p>
 <p>
  Many people died before the experiment even began.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then, the red liquid falling from above.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle…!
 </p>
 <p>
  As flames engulfed the 10,000 humans, the inside quickly turned into a hellish scene.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps because they weren’t incinerated all at once like before, a terrible inferno unfolded inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…To them, humanity is nothing more than a simple experimental subject.’
 </p>
 <p>
  10,000 humans were incinerated like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  From the eyes in the vortex that saw this, a voice flowed out.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Even after strengthening them to the maximum, they can’t even endure the sap…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The experiment is a failure.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [What a pity. I will dispose of this race.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The vortex that declared ‘disposal’ for the humans who couldn’t endure the red liquid.
 </p>
 <p>
  But at that moment…
 </p>
 <p>
  Wriggle…
 </p>
 <p>
  Something moved in the red liquid slightly pooled on the floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  In the space where 10,000 people had melted away, a small child suddenly revealed itself.
 </p>
 <p>
  A child unharmed even when wrapped in the red liquid that melted humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  [1 experimental subject survived.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [A mutant? Not only enduring the sap but also successfully absorbing it.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [But it’s still pathetically weak… How about we just start anew?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [For now, let’s continue the experiment a bit more with this individual. If this individual dies, we’ll dispose of the race.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps because a survivor emerged after numerous experiments, the voices in the vortex were more lively than ever.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, they had made up their minds to dispose of the human race if this individual died.
 </p>
 <p>
  [It survived this time too.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Unexpectedly useful.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Let’s propagate the race centered around this being.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [There will be limits to sowing seeds alone. We’ll have to give it some authority of domination.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the child continued to survive.
 </p>
 <p>
  And even grew healthily, they began to engrave patterns on his body.
 </p>
 <p>
  At a glance, they were incomparably complex patterns rather than letters.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Granting domination code]
 </p>
 <p>
  Letters that clearly conveyed their meaning to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  It felt similar to when he saw the Destruction code.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Unlike the Destruction code, the life force is strongly felt in the elements that make up the letters.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was analyzing the letters and focusing on them like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  An intense light burst out from the patterns engraved on the grown child’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the world stopped.
 </p>
 <p>
  -I didn’t die.
 </p>
 <p>
  A voice reached Seong Jihan’s ears.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  And the grown child disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Light began to enter the dark space.
 </p>
 <p>
  Along with it, a sense of reality was felt.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clank! Clank!
 </p>
 <p>
  The chains that had extended from Seong Jihan’s own body to his arms and legs were now strangling him instead.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud! Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you watch closely? Child.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A man walked up to him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Gilgamesh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  A man with the exact same impression as the one Seong Jihan had seen in Pythia’s prophecy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan could quickly figure out who he was by looking at his appearance and way of speaking.
 </p>
 <p>
  “To be precise, it’s an illusion he left in the root.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You sure do all sorts of things.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “All sorts of things, no, it was all carefully planned for the sake of humanity.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan closely observed the being in front of him.
 </p>
 <p>
  The translucent Gilgamesh without substance.
 </p>
 <p>
  No force was felt from him at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was definitely an illusion.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But I still need to be prepared, not knowing what this bastard might pull.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan glanced around.
 </p>
 <p>
  A cavity made of brown wooden walls.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s chains were stuck in all directions here.
 </p>
 <p>
  Is this the space inside the World Tree root?
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  ‘Life force keeps flowing in through the chains of the Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The tremendous life force being injected from the root through the chains.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was still within Seong Jihan’s body’s tolerance range.
 </p>
 <p>
  But if force kept accumulating like this, it seemed like he would be completely consumed by it.
 </p>
 <p>
  While thinking of a countermeasure to this, Seong Jihan outwardly asked Gilgamesh, pretending to be surprised.
 </p>
 <p>
  “A little while ago, was the survivor you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Was that what happened in the beginning… You’re showing me well what happened then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hoho, speaking of the primordial events is prohibited by the agreement with the Martial God, but… You just happened to witness the memories I left in the root, so this isn’t a breach of contract.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Is this how he avoided the contract with the Martial God?
 </p>
 <p>
  This feels more like the King of Scams than the King of Humans.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan asked him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s the reason for showing me this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… Your speech is still short.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s question, Gilgamesh suddenly crossed his arms as if something displeased him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The king commands. Show the utmost respect from now on.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But I don’t want to?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh’s eyes widened.
 </p>
 <p>
  He looked at Seong Jihan in surprise and nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “As expected of one with a Martial Soul. You don’t get dominated in one go, huh? Then, watch again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The world darkened.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the scene Seong Jihan had seen a little while ago replayed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Humanity participating in the experiment, starting from 500 to 10,000.
 </p>
 <p>
  And Gilgamesh, who survived from there.
 </p>
 <p>
  Up to the five vortexes granting the domination code to the grown him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who had to watch the movie he had seen from the beginning again.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t make it troublesome. Bow to the king, Seong Jihan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Gilgamesh’s illusion arrogantly spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You do it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He countered with a calm face.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, Gilgamesh’s expressions were distorted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No… No matter how much of a Martial Soul, how? Humans should be dominated by me…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Because of the domination code?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Domination code? The code… Can you read it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s words, his eyes widened in disbelief.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This guy saw me using the Destruction code earlier, why is he acting like this?’
 </p>
 <p>
  At first, Seong Jihan couldn’t understand his reaction.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, you’re an illusion prepared before you clashed with me in the Tower of Babel, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, how… did you know that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Because Gilgamesh in the tower saw me using the code. The one who saw that wouldn’t be surprised about me reading it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Using the code… You did?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh’s illusion looked at Seong Jihan in disbelief upon hearing those words.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Impossible! How can a human body use the code! Even I… still can’t do it…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, you kept showing me the code because you wanted to dominate me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Since he couldn’t directly use the domination code, he intentionally played back scenes of the domination code being written to try to dominate Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh slowly nodded at Seong Jihan’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Yes. You, who have reached the root, have enough value to be dominated. I decided to definitely have you, even if I had to give up one strand. Even I couldn’t stop you from becoming a constellation candidate. And you even cleared the tower. I resolved to dominate you even if I had to use one root, but…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan found it absurd upon hearing the illusion’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  How many traps does this guy set and live in?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But… The life force possessed by the chains has decreased.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan felt the chains that were strangling him in reverse weaken.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether it was due to the illusion’s agitation or because he replayed that domination code scene.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anyway, he couldn’t miss this opportunity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Snap!
 </p>
 <p>
  The chains that had extended from Seong Jihan’s body broke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kuk… Unbelievable… Watch, again…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh’s illusion retreated and replayed the earlier scene once more.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps because Seong Jihan wasn’t bound, the domination code writing scene appeared in front of him as a huge screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now it seemed like he was trying to bind Seong Jihan by playing only the essence.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I said it won’t work.”Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan saw that and chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, right. Should I try writing it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  He tried writing the domination code that appeared on the screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Following his hand, letters were engraved in the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because the base was life force, the power was vastly insufficient, and the pattern didn’t even fill 1/5.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wr-Writing the code…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh’s illusion plopped down on the spot as soon as he saw that.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Into the letters that were only written 1/5.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Life force got sucked in from all directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I only wrote the ‘Domi’ of domination, but it still has this much effect?’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was looking at the collapsing world.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Detected fragments of incomplete ability, beginning absorption.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Would you like to acquire the stat ‘Eternity’?]
 </p>
 <p>
  A message window appeared to him.

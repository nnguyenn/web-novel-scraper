 <p>
  “Wow, the subscribers have exceeded 20,000!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Has it already increased that much?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Just a while ago, it was only 8,000, but now it is more than double of it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Every day, the interest in Seong Jihan keeps growing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon felt anxious.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh… Why is it rising so quickly? If it continues like this, the US or China might come with a lot of money to recruit him.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The bald guy from the Neo Self-Defense Force has also been trying to get him.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right! I saw the chat, and it was disgusting. But at least Seong Jihan won’t go to them because of the Sword King. I’m worried about the guilds in the US or China. Their spending scale is different.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s true.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon bit her nails anxiously.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s a habit that comes out when she’s in a tight spot.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lim Gayeong shook her head, seeing her act like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Miss, don’t do that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh, what are you talking about?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Biting your nails. It has never led to a good result for you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh… It’s not always like that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  While saying that, Lee Hayeon quickly took her hand out of her mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  She suddenly stood up from her seat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We can’t just sit here. Gayeong!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s go to the parking lot first. We’ll set up a tent there.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Am I going too?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course! Do you expect me to go alone? Isn’t it scary?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You said you were trembling just thinking about BattleNet Academy…”
 </p>
 <p>
  She remembered Lee Hayeon, who used to complain about the expensive tuition of BattleNet Academy and the terrible gifts they provided, while downing alcohol. She had sworn never to go near BattleNet Academy again just the other day.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Seong Jihan is worth it.’.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But why spend the night there when she could just leave early in the morning?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Lim Gayeong tried to calm the rushing Lee Hayeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Miss! You’ll look bad if you sleep there. You should go fully prepared.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you talking about? I look fine even without makeup!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s not what I meant.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The logic was that to persuade Seong Jihan, she had to be in her best condition.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I get it. But didn’t he say he doesn’t know his phone number?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh, that guy. Does he like men?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We need to be fully prepared to test that out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Fine. I’ll cancel the tent idea.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In the end, Lee Hayeon’s tent plan was successfully thwarted.

  [Mission type: Survival.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Colosseum map.
 </p>
 <p>
  The game that Seong Jihan had been dominating since long ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  -It’s over.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Are we going to see another massacre today?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ah, survival is so boring lol
 </p>
 <p>
  – Seriously, it ends too easily
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers who came into Seong Jihan’s broadcast already anticipated the outcome.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who had cut the Flesh Golem in half, would surely not even get a scratch from Bronze League players.
 </p>
 <p>
  The players participating in the survival thought the same too.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, it’s Seong Jihan…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Darn! My luck is the worst!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why is he playing the game at this time?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Players grimaced upon seeing Seong Jihan, who was not even in armor but in casual sportswear.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The game will start soon.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Run!”nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as the game started, they scattered in all directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Being the first to die means being last, so to avoid penalties, they desperately tried to escape.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m sorry it had to be this way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Nameless Divine Arts Footwork Technique: Flashing Sky Thunder Steps
 </p>
 <p>
  With a face showing no remorse, Seong Jihan chased them in the blink of an eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hee… Heeek…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He was definitely behind just a moment ago!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A player screamed as if he saw a ghost upon realizing Seong Jihan was right in front of him when he tried to take a step.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan effortlessly stole his weapon, increasing his score, and immediately pursued the other fleeing players.
 </p>
 <p>
  – He’s just annihilating them.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Seriously, the players can’t even stand against him, they’re shamefully running away! Tsk!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Even if they tried to fight, they’d be defeated in a second lol
 </p>
 <p>
  – But if they run, at least one out of ten might survive
 </p>
 <p>
  Like a wolf among sheep, Seong Jihan displayed a massacre.
 </p>
 <p>
  The outcome of this game was clear to everyone.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have ranked 1st in the survival game.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Given that today’s game was survival, it was an expected result.
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers who were watching the broadcast…

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  – As expected, 1st place~ No status window reveal today too.
 </p>
 <p>
  – It’s a survival map, of course.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Did everyone see them running away as soon as Seong Jihan appeared?
 </p>
 <p>
  – I would run too lol
 </p>
 <p>
  After the game ended, as soon as Seong Jihan was able to view the chat, messages began flooding in from Takeda asking him to open his private message box.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Mr. Seong… You’re so strong! You truly don’t belong here ♥. If you open your private messages, I’ll make an astonishing offer to you… ♥
 </p>
 <p>
  – That guy doesn’t say much when Seong Jihan is gaming… He’s really going all out to recruit him.
 </p>
 <p>
  – After taking the Sword King, now they want to snatch up our promising rookies? Truly relentless.
 </p>
 <p>
  – If you’re Korean, please don’t go to Japan!!
 </p>
 <p>
  After briefly watching the flood of messages, Seong Jihan satisfied the viewers with a short response.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, I’m not going anywhere.”
 </p>

 <p>
  [You have achieved 1st place in the game 5 times in a row.]

  [Experience and GP gain increased by 200%.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your level has increased by 2.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have acquired 3,000 GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The rewards were incredibly lavish.
 </p>
 <p>
  By receiving the 1st place reward for the fifth consecutive time, he leveled up from 13 to 15.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Seong Jihan was slightly disappointed.

   With various traps, mazes, and puzzles, players needed party members who worked well together.

  Chapter 310
 </p>
 <p>
  “How many days has it been now? Has the Space League match started by any chance?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, it’s in two days!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Fortunately, I made it in time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t easy to grasp the flow of time inside the void training room.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I was worried I might have missed the match schedule, but it seems that’s not the case.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought it was fortunate and asked the staff.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What happened to the people trapped in the connectors?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, about that…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They’re still trapped in the same state.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. And the situation is the same for the US national team. So…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Coach Noh Youngjun glanced at Seong Jihan with a troubled look and brought up the topic.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s a growing opinion that we should return the primordial treasure to the king.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really? But I already absorbed it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Y-You did?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah…”
 </p>
 <p>
  People sighed at Seong Jihan’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  They thought they could somehow persuade him and wake up the players, but it all turned out to be in vain.
 </p>
 <p>
  “However, thanks to absorbing it, I think I’ve found a way to deal with it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Y-You have a way to deal with it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  People were startled by Seong Jihan’s words and looked at him.
 </p>
 <p>
  The King of Humans who had captivated the world’s top rankers in the game, Seong Jihan has a way to deal with him?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, it’s not certain yet, but it’s worth a try. Are the players’ connectors still in that room?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Y-Yes, they are.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then let’s go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan took the lead with light steps.
 </p>
 <p>
  Coach Noh Youngjun and the coaching staff looked at each other with unbelievable faces and followed him.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Now I understand. I can feel traces of life force.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan felt the energy rising from the connectors and raised the corners of his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  The trick of Gilgamesh, who had treated the players like his subjects, claiming it was the authority of the King of Humans.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now that he had obtained the Eternity stat, he could vaguely see through it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Chains burst out from behind Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  They all flew towards the BattleNet connectors.
 </p>
 <p>
  “J-Jihan, if they break…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Coach Noh Youngjun hurriedly shouted at the fiercely flying chains, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  Clank! Clank!
 </p>
 <p>
  The chains wrapped around the connectors just like that and extracted the life force within them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The complex patterns drawn inside disappeared along with the life force.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan saw this and thought,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Gilgamesh, you haven’t been able to fully make everyone yours yet.’
 </p>
 <p>
  They were top rankers of humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Brainwashing them wasn’t an easy task, even for Gilgamesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Maybe in the game map ‘Tuseong’, But in the real world, turning someone who doesn’t receive constellation sponsorship completely to your side requires a complex process.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That’s why the players were still trapped in the connectors even after entering and exiting the training room.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If he had made them loyal like he did in Tuseong, there would be no need for the players to be trapped in the connectors.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather, if they had come out and instigated Seong Jihan to hand over the primordial treasure, saying they wouldn’t participate in BattleNet otherwise, it might have had a bigger impact.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan dismantled Gilgamesh’s technique that had clumsily imitated the domination code inside the connectors.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Bzzt…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Electric current rose from the BattleNet connectors.
 </p>
 <p>
  Creak…
 </p>
 <p>
  One by one, the doors began to open.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, oh…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No way!?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The staff, who had been worried when Seong Jihan took out the chains, looked there with surprised eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh… Ugh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The players came out one by one from there.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although they staggered as if dizzy, their bodies themselves didn’t seem to have any major issues.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The players have come out!”
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please check their condition!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The medical team that had been on standby in advance was dispatched.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan continued to liberate the remaining connectors.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh… My head.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh, I remember becoming Gilgamesh’s chain… But what happened after that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “King? King… I forgot…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Most of the players were liberated like that, and there were two connectors left.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who’s left?”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Only players Yoon Sejin and Ha Yeonjoo are left!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Among the trapped players, the two with the highest levels are taking longer… Could Ha Yeonjoo’s sponsoring constellation also be the King of Humans?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I heard that’s not the case…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Korea had won the Champions League finals, Among the national team players, there were only a few who could be called world-class.
 </p>
 <p>
  Except for the incomparable player Seong Jihan,
 </p>
 <p>
  The currently trapped Yoon Sejin and Ha Yeonjoo, and the previously released Yoon Seah and Sophia.
 </p>
 <p>
  The rest weren’t even at the level to be selected for the Space League national team.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Are they holding onto the powerful players longer?’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Coach Noh Youngjun was thinking that.
 </p>
 <p>
  Creak…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Another connector opened, and Ha Yeonjoo came out with a tired face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “King, king… It was really tiresome. What king in this day and age.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Player Ha Yeonjoo, are you alright?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, ah… It was Jihan who freed me right? Thanks to you, I survived.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She glanced at Seong Jihan, who was focusing on Yoon Sejin’s connector with the remaining chains.
 </p>
 <p>
  She bowed her head towards him and came out with the support of the medical team.
 </p>
 <p>
  And so, there was only one player left.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan’s Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit gathered entirely on Yoon Sejin’s connector.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash…!
 </p>
 <p>
  A golden light flickered there.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh, ugh… G-Gold…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “E-Everyone, don’t look!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Avert your gaze!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The players who now had seizures just by seeing the golden light.
 </p>
 <p>
  The coaching staff and medical team also sat down and averted their gaze upon seeing it.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh’s voice flowed out from there.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You even wrote the destruction code, and my avatar… Did you defeat it too?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “It was nothing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You wasted one precious root.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the golden light shone more intensely,
 </p>
 <p>
  [This person is one who receives sponsorship from me. Unlike the others, you won’t be able to easily remove his loyalty.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed, as Gilgamesh said, Unlike other players, extracting life force doesn’t solve the issue for Yoon Sejin.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is it because my brother-in-law’s sponsoring constellation is Gilgamesh? It’s tricky.’
 </p>
 <p>
  But there’s still a way.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan extended the Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit to the Eternity inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The seal on the stat ‘Eternity’ has been temporarily released.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The seal was released.
 </p>
 <p>
  Based on the life force flooding in, Seong Jihan wrote the domination code on the connector.
 </p>
 <p>
  When he used it on Gilgamesh’s avatar before, he lacked the power and couldn’t even complete the word ‘Domination’.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This time, I can at least write ‘Domi’.’
 </p>
 <p>
  While he was at it, he tried to write the following letters as well, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  From the letter corresponding to ‘na’, no matter how much life force he used, it was impossible to write.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, writing up to ‘Domi’ seemed to have a big effect.
 </p>
 <p>
  The technique binding Yoon Sejin inside the connector began to disappear.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [No, you’re even using this code…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The intensely flickering golden light also began to be slowly sucked into this pattern.
 </p>
 <p>
  [For now, I’ll have to retreat.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Like his clone, Gilgamesh showed a weak side to the domination code.
 </p>
 <p>
  The golden light was disappearing quickly as if running away.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Creak…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin’s connector opened at last.
 </p>
 <p>
  From there, Yoon Sejin revealed himself, staggering with a haggard face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Dad, dad!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, who had urgently come to the Sword Palace after receiving the news that Seong Jihan had returned, saw that and quickly ran over.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  Before she could support Yoon Sejin.
 </p>
 <p>
  “M-Master!”
 </p>
 <p>
  He knelt down to Seong Jihan, staggering.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…D-Dad?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “From now on, I will be loyal to you, Master…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned as he saw Yoon Sejin trying to even bow to him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is it because of the domination code?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The domination code with only one letter written.
 </p>
 <p>
  But its effect was remarkable.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why are you calling Uncle master?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah quickly rushed over and grabbed his body, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  [The constellation ‘Witch of the Void’ says to just leave him in that state.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Witch of the Void’ rebukes that the guy keeps getting brainwashed everywhere he goes anyway, so it’s better for Seong Jihan to take charge of him.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Witch of the Void’ emphasizes two or three times to make sure to convey her words to Seong Jihan.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The constellation messages of the Witch of the Void, who had lost her cool, popped up in front of her eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Following Shizuru, he got brainwashed by even Gilgamesh too.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not just once, but twice.
 </p>
 <p>
  She must have been so frustrated that she said to just leave him in that state.

 <p>
  “Ah, but we still can’t do that! Uncle, can’t you undo this state for Dad? You can, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Yeah, I should undo it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who had been silent for a moment, raised his finger again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Like his sister Seong Jiah, he also had similar thoughts for a moment, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Still, I can’t treat my brother-in-law like a servant.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan had no desire to play king like Gilgamesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he released the domination code,
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin, who had been trying to bow somehow, abruptly stopped.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  He sat down on the spot and let out a deep sigh.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh… I have no shame, Brother-in-law, I keep being indebted to you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How are you? How’s your condition right now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “My body is fine… and Gilgamesh has left my sponsoring constellation… He ran away. That code you used seems to be his weakness.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He canceled the sponsorship?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah… This won’t happen again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  To the point of abandoning as the sponsoring constellation and leaving, Gilgamesh must really be weak to the domination code.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded and looked towards Coach Noh Youngjun.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Coach. Please contact the US. We need to liberate their players too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, got it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  With the match against the World Tree Alliance in 2 days, Humanity desperately needed the power of the US national team players.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “They say they already have a plane on standby at the US military base.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so? They’re well-prepared.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The US, upon hearing the news that Seong Jihan had liberated the national team players, was already ready to depart.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They say to come as soon as possible since only the bodies need to come… The US limousine is already here too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Won’t it be late if we take the limousine? Let’s just run.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Run…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The coach, who asked back with a blank face at Seong Jihan’s words, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Ah, last time when catching Shizuru, he ran around Japan too…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan had become much stronger than then.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like using light movement would be much faster than actually taking a car.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then. If we go to the US military base in Pyeongtaek…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Note: Pyeongtaek is a city in Gyeonggi Province, South Korea.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it. I’ll go ahead.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan disappeared as soon as he said that.
 </p>
 <p>
  Everyone present looked at the spot where he disappeared with dumbfounded expressions.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Two days later, at the BattleNet Center in New York.
 </p>
 <p>
  “E-Everyone has been liberated…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank goodness. Thank goodness! We can participate in the Space League now !”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan liberated the US players from the BattleNet connectors, the US staff cheered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “My master!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned as he saw Barren kneeling before him after coming out of the connector.
 </p>
 <p>
  How many times have I heard the word ‘master’ now?
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike the Korean national team, the US had many players with the King of Humans as their sponsoring constellation.
 </p>
 <p>
  As such, he had to write more domination codes to release them.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This guy Gilgamesh… He definitely put a lot of effort into the US national team.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to the Korean national team, the US national team had superior average skills.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps because there were more talented individuals on this side, Gilgamesh’s clutches were also more widespread here.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan wrote and erased the domination code for each of them one by one.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh, ugh. Thank you… Seong Jihan, forget what I said earlier.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thanks to you, I was saved from being dominated.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan also released the loyalty he received from the US players.
 </p>
 <p>
  “N-Now there are only 3 hours left until the Space League match!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “After the medical team checks their condition, we’ll have to enter the match right away…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Will it be possible?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Having to enter again right after escaping from the connector.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some of the US national team players seemed to have trauma from being in there, so they were reluctant, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is what we have to do. Of course.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Most of them readily said they would enter the connector again.
 </p>
 <p>
  The US coaching staff began preparations by moving busily.
 </p>
 <p>
  And there, the coach of the Earth representative team, Davis, approached Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Player Seong Jihan. It seems too late for you to return to Korea… Would it be possible to participate from here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “At the US center?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, we will provide you with the best convenience on our side.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it. Since there’s no time, let’s do that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The match against the World Tree Elves is in just 3 hours.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was impossible to go back to Korea and play the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to play the game at the New York BattleNet Center, where he had stayed for a long time in his previous life.
 </p>
 <p>
  And so, in the Space League match that Seong Jihan participated in from the US.
 </p>
 <p>
  “People of humanity, our goal is only one.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The representative of the World Tree Elves declared with a stiff face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We will definitely execute your Number 1 today.”

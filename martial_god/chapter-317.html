  Chapter 317

 <p>
  Chapter 317
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s the use of Constellation fame?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, upon seeing a reward he’s never seen before, asked the Shadow Queen.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Constellation fame? It’s not particularly useful for anything. Think of it as a score for the honor of one who has become a constellation.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so? So, it’s like achievement points?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Achievement points… Yes, you could see it that way. The achievements made after becoming a constellation are converted into fame points.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Hearing this, Seong Jihan’s eyes lit up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Achievement points, treated as useless by regular players.
 </p>
 <p>
  But for Seong Jihan, they were very useful through his exclusive achievements store.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Perhaps there might also be a store related to Constellation fame.’
 </p>
 <p>
  First, I need to collect the fame points.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking this, Seong Jihan drew out Eclipse.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  He swung the sword horizontally.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle!
 </p>
 <p>
  Sparks flew from the chambers imprisoning the players, and they all shattered at once.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Manager, the chambers should not be opened under any circumstance.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon seeing this, a lesser great golem hastily dissuaded Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s fine. I have a top-secret mission. For now, let the players be.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […Understood.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Unable to defy Seong Jihan’s words, the spirit returned to its duties.
 </p>
 <p>
  And from the broken chambers, players staggered out, one by one.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did, did it unlock?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Disbelieving, they looked at their bodies and then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Logout!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Immediately attempted to exit the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Damn, logout isn’t working…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Curse this map. The World Tree elves should have been more careful when pulling this out…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps because it’s a special map touched by the World Tree Alliance, the players couldn’t log out voluntarily even after escaping the chambers.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Maybe if I kill myself, I can get out of here…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eventually, some of them attempted suicide by clutching their throats, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  “My body is too healthy; it’s hard even to die.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Being okay even with suffocation, what kind of situation is this…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Was it due to the regenerative agents administered by the great elementals during their experiments?
 </p>
 <p>
  They couldn’t kill themselves even if they wanted to.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially since all their armories and such were confiscated, making it even harder for players to end their own lives.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan approached them.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shall I kill you instead?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You are…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The one who freed you.”𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  To fulfill the objective of the Emergency Mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no need to carry these players around any longer.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since this was still within the game’s map, if players could die and log out, that would also count as liberation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon Seong Jihan’s offer, the players looked at each other, and one stepped forward first.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please kill me first!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Schwaaak!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s sword brushed past the player, splitting him in two.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, one would think that was enough to kill anyone.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Vessels popped out between the split body, reconnecting the severed parts.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then quickly regenerated.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sight mirrored the healing capabilities similar to those of elves.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What, I’ve never seen this before…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this an aftermath of the experiment? It makes us unable to die…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Was it the power of the regenerative agents deployed during their experiments?
 </p>
 <p>
  The players wore a look of dismay, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just need to cut deeper.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Schwaaak!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s sword turned a vivid purple, moving several times in a flash.
 </p>
 <p>
  Turning a player into dozens of pieces.
 </p>
 <p>
  The body’s vessels burst forth, attempting to reconnect once more, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flurr…
 </p>
 <p>
  The void-bearing Eclipse flickered, fundamentally blocking regeneration.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Completely receiving a fatal blow, the player logged out.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have liberated 1 player.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Simultaneously, a message appeared, confirming Seong Jihan had completed the liberation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, he logged out!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can we really escape from here…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please kill me too!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Excited by what they saw, the players.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though they varied in size and appearance, belonging to different alien races, they unanimously wished for Seong Jihan to end their lives.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Chiiiik!
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan proceeded to log out the players in response to their pleas,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your level has increased by 1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A level-up message appeared on Seong Jihan’s system window.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s rare to level up in the game like this.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Normally, one’s level only increased immediately after defeating a significantly higher-leveled adversary.
 </p>
 <p>
  Usually, levels were cumulatively increased after the game’s conclusion during the settlement.
 </p>
 <p>
  But to react like this after cutting a player, the opponent’s levels must be high, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, while swinging his sword, asked them,
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, what levels are you guys at?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m at 401…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “414 here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Apparently, all subjects exceeded level 400.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was the lowest level here.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You all were high-leveled, huh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “High-leveled? But isn’t the Constellation the highest level here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Constellation? I’m still in the 300s.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What? But with that strength…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yep, I’ll level up a bit from this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s sword moved, and the experiment subjects started to scatter.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have cleared the Emergency Quest.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You gain 100 Constellation fame.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, the Emergency Quest was easily cleared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your level has increased by 2.]
 </p>
 <p>
  And the level up was fairly rewarding too.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Manager, logging out the subjects is a taboo within the laboratory.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can you give some of those regenerative agents?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, in turn, reached out to the great golem warning him, wanting the regenerative agents from the World Tree Alliance that showed astonishing efficacy on the subjects.
 </p>
 <p>
  [We currently need to prioritize data transmission.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then just point me to it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Over there.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash.
 </p>
 <p>
  On one side of the laboratory,
 </p>
 <p>
  where bottles were gathered in large numbers, a light flickered briefly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan headed there and decided,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There’s a lot here. No need to just take regenerative agents.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He swept all dozens of bottles into his inventory.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Cleaning out, haha.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Really going at it, even taking the pillars with him.
 </p>
 <p>
  -This Manager role is too good…
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite worries of being executed, Seong Jihan behaved as if he was at home in this place.
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers watched the final game comfortably, acknowledging it as Seong Jihan’s hallmark.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Before it ends, maybe I should gather some more of this.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan thought of collecting more items of elves instead of players’ items,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  A bright light burst from the direction where a great golem was transmitting data.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Manager, the order to blow up the laboratory has been given. Self-destruction will commence.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps the data transmission was somewhat complete.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flames flickered from the body of the great golem and then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom! Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  Explosions began to occur from all sides.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the void rapidly approaching from the ground, and the laboratory itself initiating self-destruction at various points, both the upper and lower levels of the Constellation Laboratory were collapsing.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The end is near indeed. Better start moving quickly.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Opportunities for level-up and item acquisition.
 </p>
 <p>
  They couldn’t be missed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ziiing.
 </p>
 <p>
  A screen appeared in the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  […Customer. You’ve indeed led to the closure of the laboratory map. Are you satisfied?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The tired-looking branch manager spoke up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, why close it so quickly? I was still leveling up.”
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  [Leveling up… Ha.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The branch manager disdainfully observed Seong Jihan demolishing the chambers, then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Tap! Tap!
 </p>
 <p>
  Knocking on his own mask, he brought up the main matter.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The mask you were given, would you return it, please?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Once given, asking for it back is not right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That was given under the assumption that you would become part of Yggdrasil’s lineage. You might be enchanted by the void power contained within for a while… but without periodic purification by Yggdrasil, the user will eventually be consumed by the item.]
 </p>
 <p>
  His words held a certain meaning.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, having briefly wielded the void within the mask, saw his void stat increase by 4.
 </p>
 <p>
  Using it a few more times might exceed the playable limit of void stat a player can hold.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, the player would be bound to the will of the void.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yggdrasil’s ‘purification’ would be the solution to this issue.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, you’re saying you care so much you’re now offering to take it back for free?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Would you give anything for free? Come to the loan counter. I will… price it very high for you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The branch manager spoke through clenched teeth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing his frustrated look, Seong Jihan smirked.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking that pissed off, if I go to the loan counter, there’d be at least a hundred traps waiting.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll think about it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […A wise decision, I’ll await.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon receiving a response devoid of any sincerity from Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Beep!
 </p>
 <p>
  The screen flicked off abruptly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shortly after,
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Constellation Laboratory’ will close.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The player has escaped the Constellation Laboratory.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You win the 5th match.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the map of the ‘Constellation Laboratory’ completely exploded and closed, the game came to an end.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  After the 5th match concluded.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Humanity!! Conquering the challenging game with a victory!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Against the 200 World Tree elves… leading the bronze league in 1st place, they overturned the game 3:2!
 </p>
 <p>
  =In the last match, player Seong Jihan didn’t specifically escape…
 </p>
 <p>
  =It seems he received an escape judgment as the Constellation Laboratory collapsed!
 </p>
 <p>
  The commentators announced humanity’s victory with bright voices.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow, losing to rank 20 but winning against rank 1, humanity’s class lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -See how the points are evenly shared… a guardian of balance?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Honestly, this is thanks to Seong Jihan lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -If it wasn’t for Seong Jihan, they’d just be toyed with and executed.
 </p>
 <p>
  -At Seong Jihan’s level, shouldn’t he not just be a Constellation candidate, but a Constellation?
 </p>
 <p>
  -He’s really powerful lol
 </p>
 <p>
  Although there weren’t many matches in this series, the game was once again decided by Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  As viewers worldwide joyfully talked about Seong Jihan’s strength,
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The elf high priest returned to the coach’s waiting room, her face pale.
 </p>
 <p>
  Biting her lips, she urgently said to Coach Davis across the table.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where is humanity’s top ranker?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why him?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please call him here. I have an urgent trade to propose.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is it because of the mask?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Having watched the recent game, Coach Davis guessed her intention and proceeded towards the human players’ waiting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan, what will you do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s hear them out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, Seong Jihan was brought to the coach’s waiting room, where he asked the high priestess in a relaxed voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What kind of trade do you want to make with us?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…The items you acquired at the Constellation Laboratory. Please return them to us.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There were so many things I got; what exactly do you want back?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan shrugged his shoulders,
 </p>
 <p>
  The elf high priest, clenching her teeth, slowly said,
 </p>
 <p>
  “…If you return the research laboratory’s reagents, the World Tree elves 200 will guarantee a loss to humanity until the end of this league.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  He went there to take regenerative medicine, but he decided to put everything in it, so he brought all the glass bottles with him.
 </p>
 <p>
  There Were about 100 bottles in Seong Jihan’s inventory.
 </p>
 <p>
  To provide such, promises guaranteed loss.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Did these things have such value?’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan thought to examine what was in the bottles more closely,
 </p>
 <p>
  “And if you return the Shadow Queen… the three planets of the World Tree elves currently in the Bronze League will guarantee a loss to humanity.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […Me?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The high priest treated the Shadow Queen as ‘goods’ and proposed a trade to bring victory to humanity from three locations.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm…”
 </p>
 <p>
  If three races guaranteed a win, the possibility of humanity being relegated would drop to zero.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, interested by her words, glanced leisurely at his left arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Wait, don’t tell me… not really, right?]
 </p>
 <p>
  From within, the Shadow Queen asked with a trembling voice.

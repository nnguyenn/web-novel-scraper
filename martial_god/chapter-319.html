  Chapter 319
 </p>
 <p>
  [Human Representative Team. League 1st place, defeated World Tree Elf 200!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Victory is secured, but the content of the game leaves much to be desired. Apart from Seong Jihan, there are no players to confront the World Tree elves.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Among the 20 teams of the Bronze League, a total of five World Tree elves? Experts identify two undisclosed top-tier teams as potential World Tree elf candidates.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The high priest’s revealed scam proposal; yet, some express regret for not securing even a few more victories.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The match against World Tree Elf 200, the first place in the league.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though the game ended in humanity’s victory,
 </p>
 <p>
  -Really, five elf teams? Seriously ㅡㅡ
 </p>
 <p>
  -So sick of this…
 </p>
 <p>
  -But listening to the high priest, looks like Seong Jihan will be the priority ban? Can we even win then?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Totally impossible; those 2 wins were because they deliberately lost to us. Against their actual strength, we’d have been decimated.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Lol, seriously, they regenerate faster than cockroaches. How can we win?
 </p>
 <p>
  The joy of victory was fleeting.
 </p>
 <p>
  Voices of concern about how to defeat the World Tree elves in future games grew louder.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Should we have sacrificed the Shadow Queen…
 </p>
 <p>
  -└└ The main agent, the high priest, planned to die and end it all lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -But why not clean our mouths and say we’d have secured a few wins before handing them over?
 </p>
 <p>
  -How can you trust those elf bastards?
 </p>
 <p>
  Even after securing 2 wins against the elves, the situation was worrisome due to their genuinely fierce mode and the World Tree elves’ grand scale of even imprisoning Constellations in laboratories, leaving a lingering discomfort despite the win.
 </p>
 <p>
  As people continued to worry about the World Tree Alliance even after the victory,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Constellation Shop, huh.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Returning home, Seong Jihan was opening the newly emerged Constellation Shop.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Constellation Shop – LV.1]
 </p>
 <p>
  Upgrade Constellation Shop – 50000P
 </p>
 <p>
  Open Constellation Trait ‘Dominion’ – 10000P
 </p>
 <p>
  Open Constellation Trait ‘Sole Sovereignty’ – 10000P
 </p>
 <p>
  Strengthen Constellation Trait LV.1 – 10000P
 </p>
 <p>
  Expand Sponsor Slot LV.1 – 1000P
 </p>
 <p>
  Generate Special Sponsor Item – 500P
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There’s nothing that directly strengthens me on display.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With the Achievement Shop gone and replaced by the new Constellation Shop, the shop’s items themselves focused on enhancing Constellation traits, not directly giving the feeling of strengthening player Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I currently have 23122 Fame points…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Adding the recently gained 10100 points,
 </p>
 <p>
  With the previously held achievement points exchanged for Constellation Fame, there was a considerable number of points available.
 </p>
 <p>
  With this much, he could afford everything on sale, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Can someone who’s not even a Constellation possess Constellation traits?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Currently, Seong Jihan was merely a Constellation candidate.
 </p>
 <p>
  Buying Constellation traits seemed futile if they could only be utilized once he became a Constellation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Still, since I’ve got the points, I might as well give it a try.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Being a Constellation required reaching level 777.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a long way to go, Seong Jihan decided not to let his points sit idle but to use them.
 </p>
 <p>
  The traits Dominion and Sole Sovereignty caught his eye first.
 </p>
 <p>
  After pondering over what to choose,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Queen, got a question for you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [What is it?]
 </p>
 <p>
  He decided to directly ask the Constellation Shadow Queen, residing in his arm,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you know about the Constellation traits, Dominion and Sole Sovereignty?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Oh, you’ve become a Constellation already?]
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">

   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  “No, still too far from reaching the needed level. Just curious about the traits.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Well, if you’re a Constellation candidate, it’s better to prepare in advance. Dominion and Sole Sovereignty. These two traits are options to choose from when becoming a Constellation. I had chosen Dominion.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Shadow Queen explained about the Constellation traits to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dominion, as the name suggests, refers to a monarch-like Constellation that reigns over its kind. It represents a being that symbolizes its race, and the rise and fall of that race directly impact the fate of the Dominion’s Constellation.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Trait ‘Dominion’.
 </p>
 <p>
  Choosing this trait made a Constellation akin to a king within its own race.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the race grew stronger, they shared in the effects, and the bonuses a Constellation received from sponsor players were even more pronounced for one with the Dominion trait.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Dominion… it’s truly a trait befitting a ruler.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. There was a proposal by a Constellation known for its calculations. Even if there are up to 5 reigning individuals within a species, it’s beneficial because the ability contributed by a race’s member to a sovereign is significant. However, if there are more than 5 or if the race starts to decline, the Constellation trait loses its meaning… Like in my case.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re saying there’s no bonus in your case?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes… aside from Ariel, the survivors of the Shadow Elves are extremely rare.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do Shadow Elves not continue to be born?”
 </p>
 <p>
  World Tree elves, all identical as if mass-produced, and those not fitting their mold were discarded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Out of such discarded elves, those whose resentful spirits gathered birthed the Shadow Elves.
 </p>
 <p>
  As long as the World Tree elves continued to reproduce themselves, proportional to it, Shadow Elves should have also continued to be born.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Shadow Elves derived from World Tree elves do continue to be born across the universe. However, to reign, I’d need to bring them to my planet.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, so the effect doesn’t apply if they’re on different planets.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. However, through Constellation sponsorship, other planet players can also share the effect. But this requires a Constellation to invest resources, making Dominion Constellations focus on maximizing their reign effect within their own race before turning their gaze outward.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I see? So, first priority is always the kin on the same planet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Exactly.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Being a Constellation herself, the Shadow Queen was well-versed in such information.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nodding, Seong Jihan asked her about the next trait.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What about Sole Sovereignty?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Sole Sovereignty is a trait that gives up the effects of Dominion in exchange for individual strength. It’s chosen by those in the universe who don’t wish to be bound by their race and prefer the life of a free spirit. Oh, it’s also chosen if there are already more than 5 Constellations with the Dominion trait in one’s race.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, it’s just about becoming stronger on my own. Simple.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. While the initial bonus effect given by Sole Sovereignty is very powerful, over time it faces limitations in growth compared to Dominion, especially if the race isn’t doomed… However, being unbound by one’s race is an advantage… but reaching the pinnacle requires overcoming these limitations.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re not just harsh because you chose Dominion, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [No. Go check the official member forums of BattleNet. The outcry of Sole Sovereigns fills the discussion board.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan immediately opened BattleNet’s community board upon hearing that.
 </p>
 <p>
  Only Constellation candidates and above could access the official member forum.
 </p>
 <p>
  There, prominently displayed in the top announcement, was a piece addressing the very topic.
 </p>
 <p>
  [To Constellation candidates pondering over traits]
 </p>
 <p>
  If there are fewer than 5 reign individuals within the same planet, choose Dominion.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unless you plan to ditch your race and wander the universe, choose Dominion without question.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if you prefer solo play or find caring for others bothersome, Dominion is the way to go.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you’ve risen to the status of a Constellation, surely you aim for the highest position. Choosing Sole Sovereignty might shine at the start but lacks means for growth later.
 </p>
 <p>
  Regret is avoidable—choose Dominion.
 </p>
 <p>
  └ Wish you’d posted this notice earlier… Chose Sole Sovereignty, now my race is extinct, and I’m just a space mercenary ㅠㅠ
 </p>
 <p>
  └ Why not if there are more than 5 Dominions? Dominion still seems better than Sole Sovereignty, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  └ If there are more than 5, you’re forced to snatch what abilities you can as a Sole Sovereignty because all the good parts are already taken.
 </p>
 <p>
  └ Try killing an existing Dominion if you can. You’ll be the one to get beat lol
 </p>
 <p>
  └ And if you become the 6th Dominion, the other 5 will join forces to beat you down. Better stay humble and opt for Sole Sovereignty.
 </p>
 <p>
  └ Where do Sole Sovereigns get more fame points? There’s nowhere.
 </p>
 <p>
  └ That’s why Dominion is superior. As long as your race survives on BattleNet, fame points naturally accrue.

 </p>
 <p>
  Below the announcement were numerous experiences shared by Constellations themselves.
 </p>
 <p>
  Most argued that Sole Sovereignty was inferior and Dominion superior.
 </p>
 <p>
  After reading through, Seong Jihan asked the Shadow Queen,𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can’t both be selected?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Both? Typically, the trait chosen initially requires Constellation Fame points up till level 10. Only upon reaching level 10 can one invest in another trait.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, sticking to one until hitting level 10. But there are Constellations that reached that level, right?”
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  [Of course. Such Constellations are referred to as ‘Great Constellations’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Great Constellation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s eyes widened at the term.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Great Constellation… Does it require being at the level of a Dragon Lord to reach trait level 10?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. To control the universal dragonkind would qualify one for Dominion level 10.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is there anyone who reached Great Constellation status through Sole Sovereignty?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Perhaps… ‘The Wandering Martial God’ shows the power of a Great Constellation, hence the rumor of him possibly being Sole Sovereignty level 10, but it’s unconfirmed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Wandering Martial God was also at Great Constellation level?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan realized anew how formidable his adversary was.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Had Constellations been able to open both traits as you said, initially, they would’ve opened both Dominion and Sole Sovereignty to LV.1. The initial bonus from ‘Sole Sovereignty’ is quite advantageous.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yeah, and afterward, they would’ve likely followed the Dominion route.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan scrolled through the official member forum’s posts, collecting information on Dominion and Sole Sovereignty, these traits, basic knowledge to Constellations, provided him a wealth of analyzed data.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Up to LV.3, Sole Sovereignty’s attribute + is beneficial, but beyond that, as long as the race isn’t completely doomed, Dominion holds the advantage…‘
 </p>
 <p>
  While mulling over this, Seong Jihan also searched for information related to his Constellation Shop.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, he couldn’t find content related to the Constellation Shop he possessed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even after searching through thousand-year-old posts and finding nothing,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is this like the Achievement Shop, exclusive to me…?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan surmised, deciding not to inform the Shadow Queen about it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If both open up, I definitely should. If I’m the only one with the shop, this is a unique advantage.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Mixing the longevity-focused Dominion with the immediately beneficial Sole Sovereignty.
 </p>
 <p>
  Properly managing these two traits seemed to offer significant synergy.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The only concern is whether opening a trait would strip me of the Constellation candidate status…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Initially, Seong Jihan thought to spend the points rather than hoard them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, the more he learned about the traits, the more he doubted whether their activation would allow him to retain his candidate status.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘At mid-level 300s, it’s too early to become a Constellation. I need to remain a candidate longer.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Being a special management target of BattleNet as a Constellation candidate.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though it hadn’t seemed particularly useful until now, in the Constellation Laboratory map, he could take full advantage of this status for the first time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, as a candidate, he didn’t face the Wandering Martial God’s pressure.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, his status must be maintained for a while.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm… it makes it difficult to rashly choose.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If activating a trait still maintains the candidate status, it would be a significant gain.
 </p>
 <p>
  But if it results in the loss of candidate status, then from that point on, he’d be under the Wandering Martial God’s scrutiny.
 </p>
 <p>
  Currently, though dormant, that entity won’t remain so forever.
 </p>
 <p>
  Risk or stability.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan began to deliberate over the choices before him.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Still pondering over the traits? Definitely choose Dominion. Isn’t humanity’s population around 7 billion? The effects should be beneficial.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s settled.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Really?]
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan answered the Shadow Queen’s inquiry,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your inventory is opening.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s inventory spontaneously opened, and out jumped the Celestial Cube.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [A quest suitable for the user is assigned.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Open the Constellation Traits ‘Dominion’ and ‘Sole Sovereignty’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Reward: Ability to switch Constellation Traits ON/OFF]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Upon receiving this reward, the Celestial Cube will be destroyed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Just like before, a quest was assigned.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…What exactly is this thing?’
 </p>
 <p>
  With the Celestial Cube offering rewards related to Constellations again, Seong Jihan watched the cube that emerged on its own from the inventory and his expression turned icy.

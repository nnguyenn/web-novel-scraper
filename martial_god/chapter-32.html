 <p>
  The next morning.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This car really is comfortable,”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah remarked as she buckled her seatbelt, smiling.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Didn’t you like the foreign car we rode yesterday?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The car was fine, but Heesu kept worrying about me, saying ‘Seah~ what will you do now?’… That concern itself felt a bit awkward. I didn’t really want to hear it…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan seemed to understand what she meant.
 </p>
 <p>
  When people express concern, saying ‘what will you do~’, it doesn’t always provide comfort.
 </p>
 <p>
  From the recipient’s perspective, it can sometimes feel more like they’re making fun of you.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s just use this car from now on.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come on. There’s no need to refuse when someone offers to give you a ride. It’s fine… Huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  While deep in conversation, Yoon Seah’s eyes widened a bit.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the parking spot number 17, where Seong Jihan had parked the day before, now stood a flashy sports car.
 </p>
 <p>
  And soon, the car door opened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ve arrived.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A tall woman, dressed in a suit, came out.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was Lee Hayeon’s bodyguard, Lim Gayeong, who bowed her head towards Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t she Lee Hayeon’s bodyguard?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seems so. Wait here. I’ll go check.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Me too, I want to go too!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing her sparkling eyes, it was evident she wasn’t going to listen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded slightly, parked the car in the adjacent spot, and stepped outside.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh my. Mr. Seong Jihan!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the group including Seong Jihan came out,the passenger door of the sports car opened, revealing the radiant beauty, Lee Hayeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s unexpected to see you here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Were you waiting for me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh no, it’s just a coincidence. I’m an alumnus here, so I came to visit my old teacher.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This early in the morning?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s customary to greet in the morning. Hoho, hello to you too, Miss Yoon Seah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hello, Miss Lee Hayeon!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The two exchanged pleasantries, seemingly in good spirits.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come to think of it, Miss Seah, you were the Student Council President at the academy… We share a deep connection.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was the academy’s fourth Student Council President.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah~ I see~.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps Yoon Seah’s tone was a bit blatant, as she switched to a more formal manner of speaking. Meanwhile, Lee Hayeon, who had turned her gaze back to Seong Jihan, brought up the main topic.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m
 </p>
 <p>
  “How about a coffee, since we’ve met like this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “With me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You mentioned meeting your teacher.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, I just realized they might be busy in the morning. There’s also a nice cafe in the academy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well… sure.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded his head amicably.
 </p>
 <p>
  The purpose was quite clear.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Normally, I would have declined an invitation from any guild, but…’
 </p>
 <p>
  He saw the need to maintain a connection with Lee Hayeon, who was a potential candidate for ‘Zero’.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle, are you going to have coffee with Miss Lee Hayeon?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, that’s the plan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it. Then let’s go together.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded and boarded the elevator with Lee Hayeon’s group.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  BattleNet Academy’s cafeteria.
 </p>
 <p>
  The place, usually deserted in the morning, was unusually full. Those dressed in neat suits were unmistakably working professionals.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh… it’s Seong Jihan!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t that Lee Hayeon from Divergent Guild next to him?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan and Lee Hayeon entered the cafeteria, murmurs began.
 </p>
 <p>
  Those who instantly recognized them were scouts dispatched from various guilds.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They came up from the student parking lot.’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Did Lee Hayeon also graduate from the academy?’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Divergent Guild contacted Seong Jihan first.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Anticipating contact with Seong Jihan from the parking lot, the scouts from other guilds couldn’t hide their disappointment.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I hope the deal falls through.’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If it does, we’ll contact him directly.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Hoping that the conversation between the two wouldn’t go smoothly, they sipped their coffee.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon looked around at them and smirked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems many familiar faces are here in the academy’s cafeteria.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You mean those people?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, they’re guild scouts… They must have come to see Mr. Seong Jihan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It was a good choice to wait in the parking lot.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon thought highly of her own decision as she took a seat next to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jihan, I felt hurt,” she said with a smirk as soon as she sat down.
 </p>
 <p>
  Notably, her manner of addressing Seong Jihan had become more informal, dropping the surname ‘Seong’.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I even gave you my business card, but you didn’t contact me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve been busy and forgot.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I kept waiting for your call, and I couldn’t sleep at night. Look, can you see these dark circles under my eyes?”
 </p>
 <p>
  She laughed heartily, pointing at her flawless face.
 </p>
 <p>
  Right now, she seemed as relentless as a predator in the recruitment industry.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll be more considerate next time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Also, during the broadcast… you wanted to give your contact to the person who kicked the soccer ball, right? Do you remember now?”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Yes. I remembered after that incident.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, share it with me too!”
 </p>
 <p>
  She quickly scanned the surroundings, then brushed her hair back and leaned in, whispering towards Seong Jihan’s ear, “There are too many people around. Just whisper it to me..”
 </p>
 <p>
  A faint, pleasant fragrance wafted from her.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her side profile was so beautiful that the scouts watching from a distance were utterly mesmerized.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘She’s really on a mission… Lee Hayeon!’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘With a face like that, she could’ve been a celebrity. Why did she come to this industry?’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s over, totally over.’
 </p>
 <p>
  However, contrary to the scouts’ thoughts, Seong Jihan was reminiscing about the past.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That’s the same fragrance as Zero.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He recalled the image of Zero, recklessly causing trouble while being heavily intoxicated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to take this opportunity to test the waters.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you want my number?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, satisfy my curiosity, and I’ll share it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you curious about?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your gift, Lee Hayeon.”

   Lee Hayeon’s once radiant expression turned stern. She leaned back and waved her hand dismissively.

 </p>
 <p>

   “Yes, despite serving the school as the Student Council President, they didn’t bestow me with a Gift. It’s quite unfair, isn’t it?”

 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   “…I understand. I apologize. Alright then, about your purpose for visiting today. I assume it’s a recruitment proposal,” Seong Jihan commented.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   Upon hearing that, Lee Hayeon gestured to Lim Gayeong, who promptly handed over a piece of paper.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   “Yes, we’d like to invite Mr. Jihan to our Divergent Guild. For that reason, we’ve prepared a contract that is top-notch in the industry,” she declared confidently.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   Seong Jihan skimmed through the contract. The word ‘Platinum Rank’ stood out prominently.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   ‘They are offering Platinum Rank treatment.’
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   Platinum Rank.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   The Platinum Rank consisted of players who could potentially become national representatives depending on their positions. Players in this league were among the top in the pro scene.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   “Well… what do you think?”
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   The conditions offered by the Lee Sung Guild were indeed staggering, just as Lee Ha-Yeon had boasted.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   If he signed the contract with them, he would never have to worry about money again.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   “Wow.”
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   Lim Gayeong, who had been sneaking glances, couldn’t help but gasp.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   Isn’t this too generous an offer for a Bronze Rank player?
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   ‘It’s possible because she’s from a chaebol family,’ she thought. Indeed, it was an offer only possible because Lee Hayeon was the ‘golden parachute’ executive of the Lee Sung Group.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   PR/N: chaebol – (in South Korea) a large family-owned business conglomerate.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   The other scouts, who had been keenly observing the conversation, shared the same astonishment.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   ‘A Platinum Rank contract? Are they crazy?’
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>

   ‘It was hard enough to get a Gold Rank contract…’
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   ‘We’re done for…’
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   The term “Platinum” carried such immense significance.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   “Mr. Jihan, we firmly believe that we’ll be great partners with you. Through this Platinum Rank contract, our commitment is unmistakably displayed,” Lee Ha-Yeon confidently stated.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   “Hmm,” Seong Jihan hummed in contemplation.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   “Until now, Mr. Jihan, you’ve never missed the top spot. But after reaching Level 15, a guild becomes essential. To maintain your top rank, it’s even more crucial. We promise to provide the utmost care to ensure you remain at the top.”
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   At this, Seong Jihan grinned, “Shall we make a bet?”

   “Ms. Hayeon, could you show me your status window?”

  </a>
 </p>
 <p>

  </a>

  </a>
 </p>

   “W-whaaat?! You’re already Level 15?!”
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   Lee Hayeon stood up in shock.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   Such a growth rate was hard to believe.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   On the other hand, Seong Jihan’s looked calm.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   “As you know, after reaching Level 15, the next game is always a dungeon.”
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>

   Howeve, she wasn’t shocked for long.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   Remembering Seong Jihan’s achievements, Lee Hayeon thought, ‘That’s possible,’ and sat down again.

   “…Well, fine. I see no loss in this for me.”
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   Losing would only mean showing him her status window.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>

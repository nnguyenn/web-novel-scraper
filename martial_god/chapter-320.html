 <p>
  Chapter 320
 </p>
 <p>
  [Is that a Celestial Cube?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  From Seong Jihan’s left arm, the Shadow Queen, resembling Ariel, showed herself.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still adorned with remnants of broken chains, she observed the pure white cube with surprise in her eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s been a while since I last saw one.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s been a while, you say. Have you used one before?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, I acquired it from a special mission, and used it to extend the limits of our species. Of course, our Shadow Elves were annihilated before reaching those limits…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Saying so, the Shadow Queen’s expression turned bitter as she questioned Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “And you just left this item unused. Does your kind, humanity, not intend to extend your limits?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We don’t have any limits.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I tried to use it, but it said we have no set limits.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No limits… for humanity?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Shadow Queen blinked in disbelief.
 </p>
 <p>
  Humanity, rated as the lowest for survival in BattleNet, equipped with the worst conditions imaginable.
 </p>
 <p>
  She had thought their growth limit might barely reach that of a low-tier species.
 </p>
 <p>
  The news Seong Jihan shared was astonishingly overwhelming for her.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I find that hard to believe.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s why I haven’t been able to use this item until now. Well, now I can finally make use of it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan opened the Constellation Shop, activating both the ‘Dominion’ and ‘Sole Sovereignty’ traits.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Constellation Trait ‘Dominion’ has been activated.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Constellation Trait ‘Sole Sovereignty’ has been activated.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Constellation’ mode has been added to the system.]
 </p>
 <p>
  20,000 fame points vanished as Dominion and Sole Sovereignty, originally irreconcilable till Grand Constellation, were activated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Simultaneously,
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have completed the quest.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You can now switch Constellation traits ON/OFF.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [When Constellation traits are ON, effects of both traits are partially applied. While ON, the required level to attain Constellation status decreases over time. The current level required to become a Constellation is 777.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Celestial Cube will be destroyed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Fizz…
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Celestial Cube shattered amidst a flash of light, a strong energy that Seong Jihan had not fully absorbed previously surged forth.
 </p>
 <p>
  It engulfed the cube in a crimson hue and obliterated it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Celestial Cube…! What did you do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Used it elsewhere.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan responded, then opened the Constellation window.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Seong Jihan – Unknown Constellation]
 </p>
 <p>
  -NO.4212 ‘Human’ Constellation candidate.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Although not yet qualified as a candidate, the hidden power of the Celestial Cube has temporarily unlocked ‘Constellation’ mode.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Constellation Traits – OFF]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dominion LV.1]
 </p>
 <p>
  -The overall rating of the ‘Human’ species and the growth rate of players sponsored by the Constellation provide additional bonuses.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Bonuses are divided according to the number of sovereigns on the planet.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  -There are 4 sovereigns on the current planet.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Amidst the sovereigns of humanity, you hold the highest fame.
 </p>
 <p>
  -The effect of Dominion is most strongly applied to you.
 </p>
 <p>
  -All attributes are increased by +150%.
 </p>
 <p>
  -You can sponsor up to 500 players with your Constellation power.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Based on the growth of players and sponsors within your species on the planet, your Constellation fame also grows proportionately.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘150 percent?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan gaped at the enormous bonus percentage while scanning the Constellation window.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, this is why one becomes a sovereign?
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Constellation Traits are in OFF state. All attributes are increased by an additional 1.5 percent, and you can sponsor up to 5 players.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Being not a Constellation yet, Seong Jihan couldn’t fully enjoy these bonuses.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Still, even in the OFF state, I get 1 percent effect.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The reduction to 1.5 percent from 150 percent and from 500 to 5 sponsorships in the OFF state’s trait effects.
 </p>
 <p>
  More than the 1.5 percent increase in attributes, the possibility of sponsoring 5 players stood out.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan pondered whether to sponsor players,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There’s also a ‘Human’ category.’
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Below the description of the Dominion trait,
 </p>
 <p>
  He could select the [Human] category as the sovereign target.
 </p>
 <p>
  [NO.4212 – Human]
 </p>
 <p>
  Current Ability – Lowest
 </p>
 <p>
  BattleNet Performance – High
 </p>
 <p>
  Potential for Growth – Highest
 </p>
 <p>
  Overall Rating – E
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘With high and highest ratings, overall is E…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Humanity, not set with limits and performing exceedingly well in BattleNet thanks to Seong Jihan, fared well in two categories.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the current ability rating diminished everything,
 </p>
 <p>
  A single lowest rating overshadowed high and highest ratings, plummeting the overall to E.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s see it positively. If the current ability rises, I’ll receive more bonuses here.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan consoled himself with that thought, returning to a part he glossed over in the Dominion description.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There are 4 sovereigns on the current planet…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Excluding Seong Jihan, that meant there were 3 other sovereign Constellations.
 </p>
 <p>
  Excluding Gilgamesh, it was difficult to identify the candidates.
 </p>
 <p>
  Could Martial God also be included?
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, the Shadow Queen had speculated he might be Sole Sovereignty LV.10…
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan also recalled other Constellations from humanity he knew.
 </p>
 <p>
  Longinus, Dongbang Sak, Pythia.
 </p>
 <p>
  All were kin of Martial God, players hardly fitting the Dominion trait.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Could the unseen third kind be a sovereign?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The third kin mentioned by Pythia was King Ashoka from India.
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to the other three, being a ‘king’ meant he fittingly could be a sovereign.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘And even if the Martial God isn’t a sovereign… anyway, a kingly entity would be a sovereign. Am I more famous than them?’
 </p>
 <p>
  According to the Dominion trait description, Seong Jihan was the most famous among humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite receiving the most media attention lately, could he really rank above historical kings?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Queen, don’t the chains hurt? Why leave them on?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I want to remove them too. But my power hasn’t recovered enough to do it piece by piece… But child, you really have great potential. Would you accept my sponsorship?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, I’m already sponsored by my mom.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Mom?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan glanced at Yoon Seah, who had entered the room and was casually chatting with the Shadow Queen.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah, how famous do you think I am?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Out of the blue? Who on Earth doesn’t know Uncle?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That much, huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t it obvious? Uncle always stars on Channel 0, more famous than most gods!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  Ever since joining the Space League, all humanity focused on the League matches of Channel 0.
 </p>
 <p>
  And ultimately, Seong Jihan consistently attracted attention and determined the outcome of each game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even folks on the opposite side of Earth may not know Korea, but they knew Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the current situation, being the most famous among sovereigns was quite natural.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Fame is important for a sovereign Constellation. Becoming king of humanity would be easiest, but if that’s not your style, make yourself highly visible.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle, already a constellation?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Considering you’re asking about traits, seems like you will be soon?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m in the 300 level range. Far from it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…300s? You became a candidate at level 300?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How did you become a candidate with that level… And at 300, wouldn’t you not bother with trait information yet?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just curious.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Shadow Queen looked at Seong Jihan incredulously before turning her gaze to Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Child, among humanity’s players, is there someone with potential but without a Constellation?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aha. Speaking of Constellation sponsorship? I’ll show you players I know well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Shadow Queen sought to regain her footing by sponsoring human players, her judgment criteria was facial features.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This player doesn’t catch my fancy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That, that so? How about this person?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, this face speaks of betrayal.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Um, excuse me. This person is actually my dad…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hm, hmm. Is that so? I trust my eyes, but there’s always 1 percent of exceptions. He might be one such case.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…No, you might not necessarily be wrong”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Shadow Queen assessed the players shown by Yoon Seah with a Constellation’s eye, commenting as she did,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s check the next trait.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked over the Sole Sovereignty trait.
 </p>

 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  [Sole Sovereignty LV.1]
 </p>
 <p>
  -All attributes are increased by +250%.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Includes growth rates for gifts and skill ranks by 1000%.
 </p>
 <p>
  -When gift rank reaches SSS, a new gift slot is created.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Sole Sovereigns gain an additional 100% of Constellation fame points earned in-game.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Sole Sovereigns can relocate to planets of other species.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So, this is what they mean by Sole Sovereignty being advantageous at the start.’
 </p>
 <p>
  At level 1, the bonus attribute percentages offered by Sole Sovereignty are significantly higher than Dominion.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, while Dominion can gain Constellation fame points as their race grows,
 </p>
 <p>
  Sole Sovereigns depend solely on the Constellation fame points earned within BattleNet games for growth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering the future, it’s quite clear which trait makes growth easier.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Constellation Traits are in OFF state. All attributes receive an additional 2.5% increase, growth rate rises by 10%, and 1% more Constellation fame points are gained.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the drastically reduced bonuses due to OFF state, Seong Jihan thought,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Though I can have both, starting growth with Dominion seems the way to go.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The most important for a Constellation’s growth is Constellation fame points.
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed, leveling up the Dominion trait first seemed necessary.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan reopened the Constellation Shop.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Constellation Shop LV.1]
 </p>
 <p>
  Upgrade Constellation Shop – 50000P
 </p>
 <p>
  Constellation Trait ‘Dominion’ LV.2 – 100000P
 </p>
 <p>
  Constellation Trait ‘Sole Sovereignty’ LV.2 – 100000P
 </p>
 <p>
  Strengthen Constellation Trait LV.1 – 10000
 </p>
 <p>
  Expand Sponsor Slot LV.1 – 1000P
 </p>
 <p>
  Generate Special Sponsor Item – 500P
 </p>
 <p>
  From 10,000 at opening to a steep rise to 100,000 for level 2 of both traits.
 </p>
 <p>
  And, upon inspection,
 </p>
 <p>
  [You must upgrade Constellation Shop to upgrade Constellation Traits to LV.2.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Upgrading the traits required upgrading the shop level beforehand.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The requirement is quite significant.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With only about 13,000 converted from accumulated achievements into fame points.
 </p>
 <p>
  How soon might he gather the required points?
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Constellation Shop upgrade to LV.2 requires all subordinate items to be completely upgraded.]
 </p>
 <p>
  To level up Constellation Shop, it was necessary to tick off each item, from traits strengthening to sponsor slot expansion.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Without the Constellation Shop, others automatically level up with accumulated fame points…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing how other Constellations leveled up their traits, for them, moving from LV.1 to LV.2 cost the same 100,000 as for Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Then, ultimately, I’m spending more.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Others needed only 100,000, but Seong Jihan also needed to upgrade the shop.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, even so, having both traits was a significant advantage.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm…’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan browsed, he decided to switch the off Constellation mode to ON.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [You are a Constellation candidate.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Only 50 percent of Constellation trait effects are applied.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Having the bonus only partially effective, with a combined 200 percent increase in all attributes from both traits,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This provides a significant boost.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan felt the surging power within, smiling at the suddenly boosted abilities, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  [An error is detected by BattleNet.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The level required to attain Constellation status has been lowered to 776.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon activating ON, the level required to become a Constellation dropped from 777 to 776,
 </p>
 <p>
  And 5 minutes later,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The level required to attain Constellation status has been lowered to 775.]
 </p>
 <p>
  He saw another message of the level dropping to 775.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Leave it ON a little longer, and it’ll soon reach my level.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With the Constellation requirement level dropping by 1 every 5 minutes,
 </p>
 <p>
  Eager to become a Constellation quickly, simply leaving it ON would suffice.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But then, the safety of being a candidate would swiftly end.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Currently targeted by the Marital God,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to maximize growth in the OFF state for now.
 </p>
 <p>
  Turning traits OFF, he pondered,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Time to fill those 5 sponsorship slots first.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He chose to start with the sponsorships provided by the Dominion trait.
 </p>
 <p>
  Wondering who to sponsor,
 </p>
 <p>
  -This face, it’s the face of a betrayer.
 </p>
 <p>
  He recalled the words previously spoken by the Shadow Queen.

 <p>
  Chapter 324
 </p>
 <p>
  In the heart of Gangnam, Seoul.
 </p>
 <p>
  The streets, which would usually be teeming with people, were eerily empty.
 </p>
 <p>
  And for good reason.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom! Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  Explosions roared above, with bright flashes lighting up the sky incessantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Have all the people been evacuated?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Many have left the streets, but there are still quite a few who haven’t made it out of the buildings. However…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The police officer glanced nervously upward as he continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you saying that Seong Jihan and a Constellation are really fighting up there?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… The Sword King said so. Isn’t that why he’s still busy evacuating people?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “To think this wasn’t just a BattleNet affair but happening for real…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s so surprising about that? It’s a world where dungeon portals appear.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Since Seong Jihan had left his home, a huge explosion had occurred in the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin and Yoon Seah had already sought cooperation from the government, explaining the situation and aiming to aid in evacuations.
 </p>
 <p>
  Together with those efforts, the father-daughter duo were actively helping people escape.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, oh…! Flying by sword! I can’t believe I’m actually riding one!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hold onto the sword tight, and don’t try to take selfies. You might fall.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, yes!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Police officers watched enviously as ordinary citizens descended from tall buildings on swords.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sword King Yoon Sejin’s flying technique.
 </p>
 <p>
  Something they had only seen in BattleNet matches was now unfolding before their eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’d like to try riding one myself.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stop talking nonsense and finish evacuating the citizens. We never know when something might fall from the sky.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood! But… uh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The subordinate officer, following the command, pointed shakily at the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Look, up there! A massive object is falling!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What? What?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  A giant red boulder plummeted down at great speed, heading straight for the heart of the city.
 </p>
 <p>
  If that massive object were to collide with the ground, extensive damage was inevitable.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just then.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Excuse me for a moment. Could you please take care of these people?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having landed amidst dozens of people on swords, Sword King descended to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll try to stop it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes… Yes!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sssssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  His dozens of swords joined into two, returning to the original twin blades Ganjang and Makya.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin soared upward with them in hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow… Getting to ride a sword in my lifetime.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Being unable to evacuate turned out to be a blessing in disguise.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, I got it on video!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This isn’t the time for leisure. Please, evacuate immediately!”
 </p>
 <p>
  While police officers quickly managed to evacuate those who had descended from the swords, Yoon Sejin found himself thinking strangely.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Why does my body feel like this all of a sudden? I’ve become stronger.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  He flew towards the red boulder faster than usual.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is it because I accepted my brother-in-law as my sponsor Constellation? But, I didn’t feel any different until just now…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Sword King, having his sponsor as the Constellation Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, as his powers as a Constellation were limited, the practical benefits for Sword King were negligible.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hence, Yoon Sejin didn’t so much expect sponsorship benefits from Seong Jihan as he welcomed it as a gesture to avoid falling under another’s influence again.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ve become significantly stronger, beyond just support buffs. If I add buffs on top of this…!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin’s eyes sparkled.
 </p>
 <p>
  With this newfound strength, he felt he could fight on equal footing with the World Tree Elves that had overwhelmed him.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he recalled his fights with the Elves, the meteor came into his view.
 </p>
 <p>
  “First, I’ll deal with that…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Intense sword energy surged from Yoon Sejin’s twin blades.
 </p>
 <p>
  It forcefully stretched forth, striking the red meteor.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang!
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s tough…!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite feeling stronger, the meteor’s descent speed only decreased slightly without any visible damage.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as Yoon Sejin prepared for another strike.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Brother-in-law?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>

 <p>
  A bolt of red lightning passed the meteor, revealing Seong Jihan’s figure.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  “Brother-in-law! How was the fight…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I won, but then that Constellation suddenly spewed out this rock.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Have you gotten stronger, brother-in-law?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan glanced at the sword energy radiating from the twin blades.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin’s sword energy.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was noticeably different from the last time he saw it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “After you left, I suddenly felt a surge of energy and realized I’ve become more powerful. It feels like I’m not even utilizing my full strength.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aha. It seems like I amplified the power as a Constellation. That might be the cause.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh…! To amplify the power of a Constellation! Is that even possible?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. But the effect won’t last long since I won’t be an official Constellation until later. So, until then, these effects will be more short-term.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, if it’s my brother-in-law, you’ll become a Constellation in no time. It’s an honor to be your first sponsored player.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang!
 </p>
 <p>
  As he spoke, Yoon Sejin swung his blades again, but the meteor remained unscathed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll also try to stop it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Next to him, Seong Jihan wielded the Phoenix Flag, and a sparkling red current formed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The spear, charged with red lightning, flew straight for the meteor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thunk!
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike Yoon Sejin’s attempt, the spear deeply penetrated the meteor.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
 </p>
 <p>
  And
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Wrapped in electrical currents, the red meteor’s descent halted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sure enough, Brother-in-law. You managed to stop it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin watched the now-stationary meteor in the sky with relief.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sssssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  However, as blood-red smoke began to emanate from within, his relief turned to alarm.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Longinus’s blood energy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The system had confirmed its death, yet it struggled vehemently in its final moments.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned, attempting to contain the spreading blood energy.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Execution Ground Damaged]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Currently Installing]
 </p>
 <p>
  As blue flames sparked among the blood energy, creating words.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The spread of the blood energy accelerated tremendously, attempting to form a cross.
 </p>
 <p>
  And
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh. Hmm… This isn’t good. I feel like my strength is being drained.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin, who had just been brimming with energy, suddenly staggered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, the sweat streaming down his forehead quickly turned to blood, drawn toward the cross shaped by the blood smoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Brother-in-law, please step back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Better not to hinder you than to be a burden. Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, Yoon Sejin hastily retreated downward, blood continuing to rise towards the sky from where he stood.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan observed this, his brows furrowed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Even my enhanced brother-in-law is having his blood drawn.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin, arguably the strongest human besides Seong Jihan, was effortlessly overcome by the meteor’s blood energy.
 </p>
 <p>
  If left unchecked, it might soon begin to draw blood from humans on the ground.
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No choice then.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan drew the half-mask once again, amplifying the power of the void.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, a massive swirling shadow sword formed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fundamental Divine Arts, Dark Shadow Technique – Dark Soul Vortex
 </p>
 <p>
  Whiiiiii!
 </p>
 <p>
  A giant whirlpool filled the sky, obscuring even the light, plunging one side of Gangnam’s cityscape into darkness.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What…! Why has the sky…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t that the whirlpool used by Seong Jihan? What’s happening up there…”
 </p>
 <p>
  As people witnessed Seong Jihan’s martial prowess unfolding with great intensity, some still gazed curiously at the spectacle.
 </p>
 <p>
  “People, this is not the time to watch! Evacuate quickly!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Police and firemen hustled to evacuate those bystanders.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks to Dark Soul Vortex absorbing all the blood energy, people not afflicted like Yoon Sejin could evacuate more easily.
 </p>
 <p>
  And
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll have to eliminate that with a Destruction Code.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan moved towards the meteor to inscribe it, while the Dark Soul Vortex eagerly consumed any emerging blood energy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Leaving the meteor unchecked might encourage it to draw blood again, forming another cross.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  ‘Although I’m curious about the Execution Ground, I can’t allow such danger to hover over the city.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Approaching the red boulder, Seong Jihan quickly began to inscribe the Destruction Code.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he drew near, though the meteor expelled blood energy more vigorously, it lacked the means to employ a Divine Spear like Longinus.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Destroy]
 </p>
 <p>
  Scriiiiiic!
 </p>
 <p>
  Easily, Seong Jihan inscribed the code atop it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Starting from the center where the letters were written, the rock rapidly disintegrated into dust.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the inconvenience of having to approach the target to write the letters, the Destruction Code boasted absolute destructive power.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Seong Jihan’s face wasn’t particularly bright, despite wielding such a potent weapon.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I might manage once more at best… The power consumption is enormous.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Previously, he could barely inscribe the Destruction Code once before amplification.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even now, amplified twofold, he could only manage three inscriptions at most.
 </p>
 <p>
  The meteor might have been eradicated, but if something similar emerged…
 </p>
 <p>
  He’d be without means to stop it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Is it over? The blood energy is no longer emerging.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. Come back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Responding to the inquiry from the Shadow Queen, who had been manipulating the massive Dark Soul Vortex, Seong Jihan affirmed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The black whirlwind reverted to a sword form and flew towards Seong Jihan on its own.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This blood energy… It’s a highly sophisticated force.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. Several beings convert others’ life force into their own, but I’ve not seen such a favorable exchange rate. If the Constellation we just faced had exploited its own kind to this extent, it could’ve quickly ascended to a higher tier.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Higher than Sole Sovereignty level 4?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [4? Even with a generous absorption, it’d be above 5. With severe exploitation, it might have reached 7.]
 </p>
 <p>
  So that was the power of Longinus’s blood energy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Longinus had both the Divine Spear and blood energy, and possessed many other skills, he was relatively easy to suppress.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking this, Seong Jihan closely watched the shattered meteor site.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Destruction Code had definitely taken effect, but just in case something else emerged…
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, he stood by, mask removed and Constellation mode ON.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Constellation attainment Level reduced to 770.]
 </p>
 <p>
  He noted another drop in the limit level due to the battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should turn it OFF.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The battle had reduced his limit level by seven.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though there was still plenty of room for growth, overly activating this Constellation trait was akin to mortgaging the future for present strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  He needed to conserve as much leveling potential as possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was about to deactivate the trait.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Above, where Longinus had disappeared, a feeble blue flame flickered anew.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Again?’
 </p>
 <p>
  That flame itself spelled trouble.
 </p>
 <p>
  Deciding not to wait for another meteor to form, Seong Jihan resolved to eliminate it and flew towards the source.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The blue flames, which had spread widely then disappeared due to the Destruction Code, rekindled.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Execution Ground…]
 </p>
 <p>
  As words began to form again within the flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just disappear, will you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan overlaid the last of his usable Destruction Codes onto it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Fizz!
 </p>
 <p>
  Fizz!
 </p>
 <p>
  Fizzzzz!!!
 </p>
 <p>
  [Preservation Data overwrites with Destruction Code.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Data is being deleted…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [This is permanently preserved data. Deletion is restricted.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [To fully delete, please unlock.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Several lines of text unfolded before Seong Jihan’s eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Permanently preserved data… Does this take precedence over the Destruction Code?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Though the text kindly noted that unlocking could facilitate deletion, Seong Jihan had no idea how.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Please unlock.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the flames, which had widened then vanished because of the Destruction Code, reignited, words demanding unlocking instead of reconstructing the Execution Ground appeared above.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Might as well try.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Unsure of the method, Seong Jihan reached out to touch the blue flames, a gesture made without much expectation, like clutching at straws.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon touching the flames, Seong Jihan’s expression subtly shifted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I remember now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [What do you mean?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Prompted by the Shadow Queen, Seong Jihan blinked several times, murmuring to himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The name of the third Annihilation Technique…”

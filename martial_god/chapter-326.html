  Chapter 326
 </p>
 <p>
  “Longinus is dead… I can hardly believe it. Can you show me their battle?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “First, explain why you taught Enkidu to Seong Jihan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle!
 </p>
 <p>
  From Dongbang sak’s sword, both white and black sword energies shone simultaneously.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even after splitting the Tower of Babel with a single stroke, he appeared unbothered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh’s gaze darkened as he observed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘As expected of Dongbang sak… Is he the strongest?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the five Martial Gods disciples, Dongbang sak undoubtedly possessed the greatest power.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Martial God was conducting constellation hunting, other Martial God’s disciples were not mentioned much in the universe.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just one person.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang sak alone was feared as the Cosmic Devil.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially his Taiji Sword, an unbeatable weapon that had never been blocked.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh could counter Dongbang sak’s other martial arts, but he had no confidence against the Taiji Sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood. I’ll explain.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing no need to clash with the strongest disciple over this matter, Gilgamesh willingly cooperated with Dongbang sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I merely sought to awaken the third.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The third disciple…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Have you ever seen him? Even just once?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang sak stroked his beard and pondered momentarily at Gilgamesh’s question.
 </p>
 <p>
  The third disciple.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though Gilgamesh, the fifth, had spent considerable time in slumber, he occasionally emerged during the martial god’s rest periods, unlike the third disciple who had never revealed himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…No.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right. The one who never awakens. I had to rouse him.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even going as far as to kill Longinus?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “To be frank, I wanted Longinus to be defeated. However, I never wished for his complete annihilation. In fact, I was certain annihilation would be impossible.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “And you expect me to believe that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Show me the battle footage. Then, you’ll understand.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh spoke confidently, and Dongbang sak, after a moment of scrutiny, released his sword, making it vanish into the void.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ziiiiing…
 </p>
 <p>
  A screen materialized before him, displaying the battle between Seong Jihan and Longinus.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite Longinus having used the Divine Spear, his efforts were thwarted by Enkidu
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, the second time by the BattleNet’s intervention.
 </p>
 <p>
  “In the end, it was just bad luck.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Without your Enkidu, the final moment wouldn’t have occurred in the first place.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I concede that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even as they watched Longinus fade away after his spear was blocked and Seong Jihan employed the Destruction Code, the two observed calmly, despite the demise of their fellow disciple.
 </p>
 <p>
  Furthermore.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s disappointing to see him defeated by someone who isn’t even a Constellation. Even for the weakest among the disciples, it’s disheartening.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh displayed sarcasm towards the defeated Longinus.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though his Divine Spear was formidable, Longinus was indeed the least powerful in terms of raw strength among disciples.
 </p>
 <p>
  Without the allowance to wield the Divine Spear from the Martial God, Longinus always ranked lowest in achievements among disciples.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re hardly one to talk, having taught him about Enkidu.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmph. Honestly, I had scant hope. How could a human possibly defeat a Constellation? However, Longinus quickly showed his limits. A shame for the bloodline he inherited.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, as the blue flame rose,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stop there. This is it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh pointed towards the flame.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is the power of the third disciple.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That flame?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. And this flame, indeed, is the true force that made us immortal.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Related to immortality…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang sak halted the playback to observe the blue flame.
 </p>
 <p>
  It looked ordinary aside from its color.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I assumed the immortality and eternal life granted by the Martial God were tied to your power.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “My ability, unfortunately, doesn’t fully enact the Martial God’s will. The true source of eternal life he promised you originates from this flame.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The moment the blue flame arose from Longinus’s body, he should have resurrected, despite being ‘annihilated.’ But somehow, Seong Jihan managed to… extinguish it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh’s eyes cooled significantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  From the moment he started reading and writing codes, he was an entity beyond expectations.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  ‘I wonder If Seong Jihan could be connected to the third disciple…’
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how much one pondered, he was no ordinary human.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Gilgamesh contemplated Seong Jihan’s identity,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whisk!
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang sak, having paused the playback, broke the silence.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, your intention was to coax Longinus into defeat, draw out the blue flame, and through this, awaken the third disciple?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why go to such lengths to awaken the third?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That is…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Just then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Rumble!
 </p>
 <p>
  The land of Tuseong shook violently, an uncommon event for this usually still planet.
 </p>
 <p>
  Feeling the vibration, Gilgamesh’s eyes sparkled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “He has finally awakened…! Dongbang sak. Let’s discuss it on the way. For now, we must meet him!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you act foolishly, I’ll cut you down without hesitation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Very well. Try me!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh stepped through the split in the tower, emerging outside.
 </p>
 <p>
  There, in the distance a blue light soared upwards into the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  That place was where the third disciple lay buried.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Over there!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh grinned with glee.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though Seong Jihan’s actions were unexpected,
 </p>
 <p>
  Should the third awaken, things would proceed as originally intended.
 </p>
 <p>
  With that thought, Gilgamesh soared at full speed, closely observed by Dongbang sak, who swiftly followed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘You still have quite a bit of power hidden away.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon reaching the erupting light,
 </p>
 <p>
  The ground pulsated with bursting light.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Third disciple! Have you awakened?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh shouted, but the ascending blue light, unable to climb further, plummeted towards the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  A giant black hand materialized in the void.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Gilgamesh.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  A chilling voice resounded from within.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’ve caused quite the commotion.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Martial God… How…! This violates our agreement!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh yelled incredulously.
 </p>
 <p>
  [What you’ve interfered with precedes our agreement…]
 </p>
 <p>
  The black hand plummeted towards the earth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  The blue light ceased, the cracked ground resealed itself, and the third disciple’s resting place reverted to its original state.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The third takes precedence over our agreement…”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Gilgamesh watched, disheartened,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whish…
 </p>
 <p>
  From the dissolving black hand, the Martial God’s voice emerged.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Seong Jihan… has been marked for management, Dongbang sak.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, my Lord.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [When he is released from management, you are to kill Seong Jihan immediately. Unsheath the Taiji Sword and ensure his complete annihilation.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as the Martial God had once instructed Longinus to wield the Divine Spear, He now ordered Dongbang sak to obliterate Seong Jihan with the Taiji Sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I shall obey. But unsheathing the Taiji Sword on Earth might severely distort the planet…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It doesn’t matter even if half of humanity is erased.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang sak said that if he used the Taiji Sword, Earth would warp and the Martial God anticipated that half of humanity would disappear.
 </p>
 <p>
  At first glance, the discussion seemed fanciful.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But with him, it’s entirely possible.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh, listening, found nothing unusual about it.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Taiji Sword was an absolute weapon, far beyond the realm of ordinary understanding.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whish…
 </p>
 <p>
  [Remember, you must kill him with the Taiji Sword…]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God’s energy faded after re-sealing the third,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood… Then, when he becomes a Constellation, I will personally intervene.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang sak bowed in acknowledgment.
 </p>

 <p>
  After the battle in the sky concluded,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Seong family managed to return home only late at night, having settled the turmoil in Gangnam.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s fortunate there were no casualties.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Indeed. When lights and explosions were bursting in the sky, I thought we were doomed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seah turned on the TV,
 </p>
 <p>
  Currently, the news was broadcasting.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wow… Amazing. I’m riding on a sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  – They said not to record, but… how could I not?
 </p>
 <p>
  A video of ordinary people flying with Sword king Yoon Sejin’s technique was being shown.
 </p>
 <p>
  “See, I told people not to take photos, and they went ahead and recorded videos.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Dad… words don’t work on these people. But it does look fun. I’d like a ride too!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Would you like one now? I can take you out right away.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin was ready to take Seah out for a ride immediately upon her request.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No. I’m also exhausted today… I did my share in rescuing people.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright. Just let me know whenever you want a ride.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Has dad gotten stronger than before?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin smiled at that, turning to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Our Constellation has bestowed me with strength.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Brother-in-law, that’s only temporary. It’s not effective now, is it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not the explosive strength like before. But it seems about 30 percent of the effect still lingers. It’s not entirely ineffective.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s eyes lit up at that.
 </p>
 <p>
  30 percent.
 </p>
 <p>
  The duration of this effect was uncertain, but even a day’s persistence would be favorable.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Maybe it’s time to prepare more sponsored players.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Initially, he was reluctant to sponsor players, fearing it would merely occupy Constellation slots.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, with a remaining 30 percent effect, the situation changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan planned to sift through the guild tomorrow, considering prospective sponsorships.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile,
 </p>
 <p>
  On their way home, Seah, who had heard about Seong Jihan’s battle, asked,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle, that Constellation you fought in the sky… Didn’t it drop any items?”
 </p>
 <p>
  She asked Seong Jihan with curiosity.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Items?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, you defeated a Constellation! You should get some good rewards for that!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I did get something.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan opened his inventory and retrieved the object he had earned.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What’s this? A stick?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a spear.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If it’s a spear… Where’s the tip?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Spear of the Blood Clan, obtained as Longinus’s data disappeared, looked merely like a dark wooden spear shaft.
 </p>
 <p>
  More fitting for a staff than a spear, the Blood Clan’s spear seemed somewhat disappointing as a Constellation’s gift.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It looks underwhelming for an item given by a Constellation…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, I think I know its use.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recalled the Blood Clan inscribing letters on the spear shaft and utilizing it to kill giants impaled on crosses.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Using the Destruction Code directly is currently quite cumbersome. However, if this could be used as a medium to activate the power of destruction from a distance…’
 </p>
 <p>
  This would significantly enhance the utility of the Destruction Code.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan smiled.
 </p>
 <p>
  Longinus was Generous to the end, even in death.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m off to experiment. I’ll go first, brother-in-law.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay. Go ahead”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, uncle. Going to the training room? Take care~”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin and his daughter bid Seong Jihan farewell as he departed for the void training room.
 </p>
 <p>
  The newly acquired item.
 </p>
 <p>
  He must effectively utilize and master its application.
 </p>
 <p>
  With high expectations, Seong Jihan entered the training room, only to be greeted by,
 </p>
 <p>
  [I’ve been waiting for you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A figure made of white light, with visible eyes and mouth, greeted him.
 </p>
 <p>
  [May I interrupt you?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Are you the Arena’s Master?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan initially reacted nonchalantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. Today, I’ve come here urgently hoping for an important deal.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “A deal? What kind?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I offer to release the Witch of the Void.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Hearing the proposal, Seong Jihan’s expression radically changed.

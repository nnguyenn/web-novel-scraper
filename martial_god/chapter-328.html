  Chapter 328
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sponsorship, huh? As a Constellation, you wish to sponsor me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not exactly a Constellation sponsorship. Instead…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Arena’s Master conjured something from the void.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sparkle!
 </p>
 <p>
  Unfurling his hand, a card shimmering with rainbow hues was revealed – an item that looked extraordinary at a glance.
 </p>
 <p>
  [That, that’s… a VIP Membership?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Shadow Queen perched on Seong Jihan’s arm exclaimed in shock upon seeing it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A VIP Membership?’
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes… It’s an item that’s a level above the Space League Premium Membership I’ve only seen around in BattleNet communities, never in person.]
 </p>
 <p>
  An item that surpasses the premium membership.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recalled the effects of his own premium membership.
 </p>
 <p>
  Basically, during the membership period, a 100% increase in experience and GP acquisition, along with the ‘Hideout’ feature concealing his information and a 30% chance of being excluded from the opposing team’s ban list.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But I’ve hardly ever felt the 30% ban exclusion, so it’s practically only those two features that were of any use.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Hideout feature had been handy for concealing his identity.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, ever since becoming Earth’s number one, its utility wasn’t as significant as before, with the membership becoming less useful.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan skeptically addressed the Shadow Queen.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s just a membership card, is it really worth getting this excited about?’
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ha. “Just a membership card” you say! This is an item even the high-level Constellations struggle to obtain. Everyone desires it but nobody knows how to acquire it. And now, the Arena’s Master is offering it…]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Really? The premium membership has been less useful lately, anyway.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [The VIP Membership is incomparable to the premium one.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Shadow Queen asserted, the Arena’s Master tightly gripped the card.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  From the card shining with rainbow light, void energy emanated, swirling with violet smoke around it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll offer you this VIP Membership Card with ‘Void Authentication.’”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Void Authentication?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Take a look.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan received the card, the item description appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Space League VIP Membership Card (Void Authenticated)]
 </p>
 <p>
  – Grade: EX
 </p>
 <p>
  – Certified by ‘The Owner of the Arena’ as a VIP membership card.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Holding this card increases the acquisition of experience and GP by 500%.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Enhanced ‘Spotlight’ and ‘Hideout’ features are applied to the player, allowing for a choice between them.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Holding this VIP membership includes a 50% chance of being excluded from the opposing team’s ban list.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Spotlight]
 </p>
 <p>
  – Announces the player’s premium membership across the BattleNet. It attracts the attention of many Constellations, allowing for sponsorship from across the cosmos.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Being a VIP member intensifies the effects.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ads about the player will randomly appear on the Alien Species 0 channel, as the subscriber count of alien species on BattleTube is increased, it will boost cosmic fame and Constellation fame.
 </p>
 <p>
  – With BattleTube active, achieving a certain comprehensive viewer count activates the ‘Star’ buff. The Star Buff intensifies as the comprehensive viewer count rises.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…The ability is strengthened based on the comprehensive viewer count?’
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan had skipped over the Spotlight feature when he had the premium membership, the Spotlight feature of the VIP membership was clearly not on the same level.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the downside of being globally recognized.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fame from notoriety, and a Star buff dependent on viewer count, were unique benefits only available to VIP members.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though the details were not specified, it was clear why the Shadow Queen was so astonished by the VIP Membership.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Then, the next feature is…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Given the promise shown by Spotlight, Seong Jihan wondered about Hideout.
 </p>
 <p>
  Skimming the description for Hideout’s details revealed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hideout]
 </p>
 <p>
  – Conceals the player’s information under premium membership. It reduces attention from Constellations and makes it difficult for opposing teams to acquire the member’s information, prolonging the time to gain fame within BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  – The VIP member status enhances its effects.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Players are removed from racial rankings and have a 100% chance to avoid bans. During the VIP membership, any mention of the player within the BattleNet community will be automatically deleted. Only admins can observe you.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Spotlight seems more appealing compared to this.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite its upgrade, Hideout, aimed at concealing oneself, seemed less impressive, even with VIP enhancement.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the guaranteed ban avoidance was profoundly effective, it didn’t specifically bolster Seong Jihan’s strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Choosing Hideout would ensure ranking first among humans…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Since Seong Jihan had already dominated the World Tree Elves’ competitors.
 </p>
 <p>
  Being free from bans would enable him to win every remaining game.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">

 <p>
  But Seong Jihan’s adversaries were not limited to the Space League species.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘With Longinus dead, who knows what Constellation from Tuseong will come next. To free my sister from The Abyss Master, I must increase my strength without fail.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If he had to choose between the two, it’d be Spotlight this time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan then noticed the purple text added at the bottom of the item description window.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Void Authentication]
 </p>
 <p>
  – Received the Void Authentication from ‘The Owner of the Arena.’
 </p>
 <p>
  – The capacity to accommodate the void significantly increases, allowing for one refusal against being bound by the void’s will.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Access to the Space Arena is granted for free.
 </p>
 <p>
  – The authentication effect lasts for 6 months, requiring re-certification by a Great Constellation to renew the VIP membership effects.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Arena’s Master truly was a Great Constellation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Realizing this from the last line, Seong Jihan inquired.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So the 6-month authentication applies to the entire VIP membership effects?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s correct. Without re-certification, the VIP Membership will expire.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I see…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This time, I’m offering the VIP card merely as sponsorship. For re-certification, I’ll be asking for a nominal fee.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Arena’s Master pointed at half of his face, tapping it while hinting at what he wanted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re asking for the Void Processing Facility?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. The VIP Membership Extension and the Void Processing Facility… it’s a fair trade. Next renewal, I will claim the Code Medium.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Planning to obtain what he couldn’t recover this time through the VIP Membership.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan grinned, storing the VIP Membership in his inventory.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll consider that when the time comes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I look forward to a wise decision. Then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pop!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Arena’s Master snapped his fingers, closing the portal connected to the Abyss.
 </p>
 <p>
  And his body gradually became translucent.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s been a lengthy inconvenience. I should take my leave.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Such inconveniences are always welcome.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, one last piece of advice before I go. Prepare thoroughly before challenging the Abyss Master. The one who has bound the Witch of the Void possesses the strength of a high-level Constellation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “high-level, huh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Make good use of the VIP Membership.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With those parting words, the Arena’s Master exited the training ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This acquisition is quite significant.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Acquiring the Spear of the Blood Clan and remembering the Third Annihilation Technique – Returning Light from defeating Longinus, plus the VIP Membership given by the Arena’s Master.
 </p>
 <p>
  The rewards for toppling a Constellation were sweet indeed.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Abyss Master… Why such an obsession with my sister? And specifically targeting me is also mysterious.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The existence of the Abyss, strongly binding his sister, Seong Jiah, and his undecipherable motives left Seong Jihan perplexed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How strong would a high-level Constellation be?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [At my peak of Lv.7 Dominion, I was barely high-level.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “So high-level starts from Constellation level 7.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. However, I couldn’t resist 999 times against the Arena’s Master. He’s either stronger or has a special method.]
 </p>
 <p>
  By that measure, the opponent seemed far stronger than Longinus, whom he recently faced.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Was the Abyss Master always this strong?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [While some Constellations occasionally take charge of the Abyss, none have been high-level. This opponent is just unique.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [As the Arena’s Master said, even with full preparation, it won’t be easy.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded at the Shadow Queen’s reminder.
 </p>
 <p>
  Had it not been for Enkidu’s crucial involvement, subduing Longinus would have been challenging.
 </p>
 <p>
  Facing a high-level Constellation, with his current strength, would be even more difficult.
 </p>
 <p>
  To challenge him,
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems I’ll need to activate Spotlight.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to activate Spotlight for the VIP Membership.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Spotlight has been activated.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hideout has been deactivated.]
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite changing the settings, there seemed to be no significant change for Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Days after acquiring the membership, Seong Jihan opened his BattleTube channel.
 </p>
 <p>
  His channel now separately displayed the subscriber count for alien species.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s alien subscriber count was around 100.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are the ads on Channel 0 working? The subscriber count isn’t rising much.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your human race subscribers are incredibly numerous.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “But those don’t count much towards the overall viewer rating.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s a pity. Had the Shadow Elves been alive, I’d have forced them to subscribe to your channel.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then you subscribe.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hm…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Shortly after, the subscriber count for alien species on Seong Jihan’s channel increased by one.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘You didn’t subscribe until now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Lacking sense despite owing him.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan gazed at his arm,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Shadow Queen defensively explained,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your BattleTube content is too sparse. I thought you weren’t interested in managing it.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Content? My videos are plentiful.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Videos of the lowest species fighting amongst themselves, with one annihilating several, are hardly attractive. Imagine ants fighting, and one ant slaughters them all.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “That sounds interesting, though.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Sorry, but the universe is full of that.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan furrowed his brow.
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s no meaning in activating Spotlight like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The World Tree Yggdrasil wants to sponsor player Seong Jihan.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as Seong Jihan disabled Hideout, Yggdrasil from the World Tree Alliance relentlessly messaged him.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The World Tree Yggdrasil offers Seong Jihan candidacy for Constellation in exchange for significant rewards.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The World Tree Yggdrasil inquires if Seong Jihan is interested in joining the World Tree’s race.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The World Tree Yggdrasil…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Spammed messages from him felt like receiving junk mail.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, this guy is so annoying.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Player Seong Jihan has blocked The World Tree Yggdrasil.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan utilized the block feature, available only for message spammers, on Yggdrasil.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who’s that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s Yggdrasil.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’re something else. Blocking Yggdrasil…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why am I attracting such pests?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tell the World Tree Elves to subscribe to your channel.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “They said they would do it if I accepted sponsorship.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […]nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
 </p>
 <p>
  Yggdrasil’s obsession with Seong Jihan seemed profound.
 </p>
 <p>
  He seemed determined to sponsor Seong Jihan, which certainly didn’t feel like anything to accept.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Boss~ I’ve brought the documents for players without Constellations. Oh… Are you checking your channel?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Guild Master Lee Hayeon brought documents to Seong Jihan, blinking in surprise.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. The subscriber count isn’t growing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What? You mean your subscriber count isn’t growing? Haven’t you surpassed 100 million a while ago?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not humans. Alien subscribers.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon nodded in understanding at that response.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now you have 104 subscribers… Even being Earth’s number one, it seems insufficient.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It doesn’t satisfy me. I need to gather more, but there’s no way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… Gaining alien subscribers? How do other aliens gather subscribers anyway? Doing something similar could help.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon said this while turning on her own BattleTube.
 </p>
 <p>
  “My BattleTube doesn’t show alien videos.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really? Mine does.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… Yours does? Shall we take a look for reference?”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Hayeon’s suggestion, Seong Jihan nodded and went to the BattleTube main screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  There, numerous viral videos uploaded by alien species were listed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh! Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, I can’t seem to touch the screen. Boss. Can you skip to the next one?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sure.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon flipped through the videos one by one, examining the topics of the popular videos with an eagle eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… it seems aliens aren’t much different.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon grinned, proposing a solution.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Boss, I think I have a good idea.”

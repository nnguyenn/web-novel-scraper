  Chapter 332
 </p>
 <p>
  A brief silence enveloped the alien chat.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Uh… is it really over just like that?
 </p>
 <p>
  – The bet GP rewards came in…!
 </p>
 <p>
  – My planet… Is it saved? It’s saved!!
 </p>
 <p>
  However, as the actual bet amounts started inflating and coming in, the chat was quickly flooded with incessant messages.
 </p>
 <p>
  – When the alt of Three Heads appeared, I thought it was all over…
 </p>
 <p>
  – To sweep it away with a single strike.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ah, I should’ve bet more GP… Regretting betting only a little now.
 </p>
 <p>
  – This player, for being the lowest rank, is stronger than expected?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Still, he was attacked without armor, so it’s still hard to say how strong he really is.
 </p>
 <p>
  – We’re saved! Freedom for the 100 million citizens…! I’ll pay off my debts and never bet again!
 </p>
 <p>
  – The 100 million villain survived 😂
 </p>
 <p>
  Responses expressing regret for not betting more on Seong Jihan,
 </p>
 <p>
  and those surprised by the powerful attack of the lowest-ranked player, coexisted in the chat.
 </p>
 <p>
  – At this rate, it’s worth betting on the next game too.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Gotta bet the same amount I won this time lol
 </p>
 <p>
  – I’m passing. With the armor on, the fight would have been unknown.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Having subdued the Prince of Three Heads and Six Arms, he’ll be matched against stronger opponents next… Wouldn’t it be tough?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Well, he’s still lowest-ranked after all.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, the portion of those willing to continue betting on Seong Jihan wasn’t very high.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although they enjoyed this one win, they believed his victory was because his opponent had voluntarily removed his armor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile,
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ahh… Told you. 1:1 battles end even quicker.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Was looking forward to a Space Arena match, but he died in one hit ㅡㅡ;
 </p>
 <p>
  – The opponent, thinking Seong Jihan was just lowest rank, even removed his armor smh…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Thinks he’s some kind of elite, taking on the battle in just underwear lol
 </p>
 <p>
  The human viewers, having seen Seong Jihan’s victories in the past, displayed an indifferent reaction, taking for granted that this outcome was expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  – Hey, but the alien chat was going crazy, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  – ?? Why?
 </p>
 <p>
  – They bet on Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Eh? You can bet in the arena? I’m a betting site regular, but haven’t seen that.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Uh… There’s now a new arena section if you go check?
 </p>
 <p>
  As the arena betting was just added to the betting sites, humans also began to show interest.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wow, why are Seong Jihan’s odds so high?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Seong Jihan, a safe asset like him, getting treated like this…
 </p>
 <p>
  – I guess I have to bet at all costs?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Being treated as lowest rank has its perks lol lol lol
 </p>
 <p>
  Every human knew Seong Jihan’s unmatched strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  But in the arena betting, his strength was severely underrated due to the stigma of being from the lowest rank.
 </p>
 <p>
  – But isn’t it a bit much to just bet willy-nilly? Watching the alien chat, it seems the contenders now are constellation alts?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Seong Jihan won against a constellation, what chance would alts stand? lol
 </p>
 <p>
  – lmao
 </p>
 <p>
  – Normally, I don’t bet, but this is different. This game’s a guaranteed win
 </p>
 <p>
  – Withdrew my entire fortune. To the moon!
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike the alien species, humans, who had solid faith in Seong Jihan they’d observed over time, began pouring enormous amounts of GP into betting on the next game in the arena.
 </p>
 <p>
  Consequently, in the betting odds for the next game’s winner, the odds designated for Seong Jihan rapidly dropped.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Why are the odds for lowest rank like this?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Makes it less fun…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Looks like the lowest rank’s kin invested a huge amount.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Lowest rank still has that much GP left?
 </p>
 <p>
  – If the odds are like this, there’s no point betting on lowest rank. I’d rather bet on the opponent.
 </p>
 <p>
  – But this player beat a constellation, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Saw the video subduing the Ancient Elf. Lucked out to win, wasn’t skill.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, the alien species, not feeling the appeal to bet on Seong Jihan, instead flocked towards his next opponent.

 <p>
  The victory in the first game was seen as a fluke because the Prince of Three Heads and Six Arms had removed his armor, and from the next game onward, they believed his true skill would be tested.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the second game commenced.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Matching opponent…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Fire-Breathing Blue Dragon’ has been matched.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The second opponent was a massive dragon.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Judging by size alone, the disparity was between tens to hundreds of times difference, illustrating a complete mismatch.
 </p>
 <p>
  The dragon, adorned with blue scales, looked down on Seong Jihan from above.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the ranking of species, the high-ranking dragonkin, among the highest, stood stark against the lowest-ranked humans.
 </p>
 <p>
  Their drastic size difference symbolized their respective standings.
 </p>
 <p>
  – It’s over.
 </p>
 <p>
  – The constellation of the ‘Blue Scale Dragon Clan’, the Blue Dragon’s secondary clan, that dragon?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Right. I heard that they are mastering all the air attributes and raising a new secondary character to gain fire through the body of a blue dragon.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Normally, the odds wouldn’t exceed 1.1… but due to the lowest rank investing in Seong Jihan, it rose to 1.4.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Gotta invest in safe assets, then.
 </p>
 <p>
  – No matter how skilled the lowest rank is, the Blue Dragon will be challenging.
 </p>
 <p>
  Facing an opponent who had become a constellation in the formidable dragon world, the Blue Dragon.
 </p>
 <p>
  His alt character, seeking to gain the power of fire, truly exuded a formidable aura.
 </p>
 <p>
  A far stronger-looking foe than the earlier opponent, the Prince of Three Heads and Six Arms.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Is it the fate of your species at stake? A vast amount of GP has been entrusted to you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not really. People just think I’ll win.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I’ve seen the results of the first game. You possess exceptional talent beyond the limits of your species. However… I won’t be complacent.]
 </p>
 <p>
  This opponent had a different mindset from the underwear-clad Prince of Three Heads and Six Arms.
 </p>
 <p>
  The giant dragon spread its wings wide, dominantly marking its presence on the battlefield.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sparks flew from all directions, extending outwards.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Blue Dragon, controlling atmospheric power and utilizing lightning attributes, also harbored a massive blaze within his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Disappear!]
 </p>
 <p>
  With the striking thunder and pouring flames, the fire power the Blue Dragon honed to acquire the Dragon Breath was fully unleashed at this moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  The overwhelming onslaught of fire and lightning, akin to a massive calamity, had the alien viewers cheering for the Blue Dragon.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Blue Dragon! Blue Dragon!nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
 </p>
 <p>
  – Using full power against the lowest rank…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Truly a player to be emulated.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Not disappointing those who bet…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Really, will this player block the attack once, or just get annihilated? I’d bet on that.
 </p>
 <p>
  – You think that bet would stand? How’s he supposed to stop that lol
 </p>
 <p>
  Everyone expected Seong Jihan to be utterly crushed.
 </p>
 <p>
  But,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Holding fire within, and that’s all you’ve got?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan pulled out his spear from the inventory, the pouring fire and lightning began converging towards the spear’s tip.
 </p>
 <p>
  And atop it, red lightning merged, turning more intense.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Blue Dragon’s attack had no effect on Seong Jihan, instead, it only fueled his strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  [How… how do you control my power…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “If that’s all, then I might be more advanced than you in this power.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, looked at the spear now dyed in red lightning,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  He threw it high up into the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fundamental Divine Arts, Heavenly Dragon Thunder Fire – Dragon Thunder
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, a rift formed in the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  White flames blossomed from within, with red lightning flowing over them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike the Blue Dragon’s combined powers, which failed to merge, the white and red energies were tightly bound.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Is this… the Dragon’s Breath…]
 </p>
 <p>
  While the Blue Dragon watched the sky in shock,
 </p>
 <p>
  A vast firestorm overturned the sky, and from within, the white flames poured down towards the ground.
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Blue Dragon, directly hit by the Heavenly Dragon Thunder Fire, began to burn.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Though not of our kin…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You think only dragons can use Dragon’s Breath?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan lightly commented,
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  [Heh. A god has appeared.]
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, the Blue Dragon was engulfed in flames and vanished.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ah, no…
 </p>
 <p>
  – What’s with that crazy talk! Dragon Breath is for dragons only!
 </p>
 <p>
  – What was the Blue Dragon doing! Isn’t this match-fixing? How could a dragon be defeated by the lowest rank’s flames?!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ugh, ugh… No! Quick, respawn, Blue Dragon! My 100 million kin are facing doom!!
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike the first game, Seong Jihan’s alien chat turned into complete chaos.
 </p>
 <p>
  The alien viewers, who had not placed their trust in him, were now paying the price.
 </p>
 <p>
  – The 100 million kin… isn’t that the 100 million villain from before? lol lol lol
 </p>
 <p>
  – Yep, that’s him. Swore off betting after paying debts and immediately bets on the second game lol lol
 </p>
 <p>
  – Anyone leveraging their planet as collateral is a severe gambling addict…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Lucky once but such folks eventually go bankrupt like now yup yup
 </p>
 <p>
  While a minority of aliens, who happened to bet on Seong Jihan, chuckled in the chat,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Victor: Seong Jihan.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The match had already concluded.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Even if the opponent’s a constellation alt, being just in the Master League makes it a bit dull.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, having received various buffs, stood a chance against the constellation Longinus.
 </p>
 <p>
  For him, a player remaining in the Master League was definitely manageable.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘When will I move up to the next league?’
 </p>
 <p>
  While he was contemplating ascending to the Grand Master League for a worthy challenge,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your level increases by 1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [A special reward is granted.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike the first round, Seong Jihan received a reward.
 </p>
 <p>
  Due to it being a Space Arena match, leveling up immediately after defeating two opponents,
 </p>
 <p>
  if he kept juggling the arena and general games, reaching level 400 would be swift.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan then turned his attention to the special reward.
 </p>
 <p>
  And,
 </p>
 <p>
  [A special reward, ‘Race Evolution Bonus’ is granted.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The affinity for lightning attributes increases by +1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The reward for defeating the dragon appeared on the screen for his viewers to see through BattleTube.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Race evolution?!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Lightning attribute affinity!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Is it given for subduing the Blue Dragon…?
 </p>
 <p>
  – A special reward appearing just in the second game. Normally, the chances are less than 10%?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Quite the lucky player
 </p>
 <p>
  As the aliens murmured, wondering why such a reward appeared so soon,
 </p>
 <p>
  – Lightning attribute affinity?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Does that mean better control over lightning magic?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Not related to lightning lol Just increase my health, will ya? lol
 </p>
 <p>
  – Right, normal people don’t use electricity… maybe less likely to get electrocuted?
 </p>
 <p>
  – If Seong Jihan obtained the evolution bonus, we should be thankful and accept it, why complain ㅡㅡ;
 </p>
 <p>
  – True lol. Got too comfortable. Humans made a fortune with this game lol lol
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, humans, not feeling as significant as when health improved, mostly reacted with indifference, acknowledging the benefit but without much excitement.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the other hand, Seong Jihan, with keen interest, observed the message.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Lightning attribute affinity… obtained from the Blue Dragon?’
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed he mostly received health-related rewards until now.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, evolving in this manner was also possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he thought that, Seong Jihan collected the phoenix feathers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, he manipulated a stream of red lightning.
 </p>
 <p>
  A lighter flow of electric current was perceptible than before.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It… applies to me too.’
 </p>
 <p>
  While health improvements were hardly noticeable for Seong Jihan, given his Martial Soul and life energy, making him akin to a health deity, this time was different.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though the effect was weak, only +1, a clear increase in affinity was felt.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Not just for humanity, but for myself as well, I have to keep this in mind.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Realizing even such bonuses were provided, he found the arena to be a truly rewarding place.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s lips curled into a slight smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Race… evolution bonus, huh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, in the arena… they give out such things?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching Seong Jihan’s BattleTube, BattleNet Association officials,
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon confirming that bonuses applying to the entire race were distributed in the arena, quickly convened an urgent meeting.

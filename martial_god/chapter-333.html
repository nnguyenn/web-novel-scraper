  Chapter 333
 </p>
 <p>
  In the New York headquarters of the World BattleNet association, high-ranking officials from various nations gathered, wearing expressions of serious concern.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Today’s agenda concerns the evolution bonuses in the Space Arena.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Lightning Attribute Affinity +1… What are its effects?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ve confirmed that for mages, their lightning magic has increased in power by at least 10 percent, and up to 30 percent in some cases.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Interestingly, over the past few days, several players who received gifts have discovered talents related to lightning, a rarity usually.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even with just a +1 increase, the effects are prominently visible.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The discussion centered around the lightning attribute affinity bonus Seong Jihan earned, which subsequently applied to all of humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though only a few days had passed since its acquisition, its effects were markedly observable.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike when health had improved, this was a situation that significantly boosted humanity’s collective strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Furthermore, since Seong Jihan’s participation in the Arena, the Space Arena feature has been unlocked for players.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Space Arena is now open to humanity.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Players above level 250 can now participate in the Arena.]
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan achieved three consecutive victories in the Space Arena, players above level 250 were suddenly granted access to the Space Arena by the system.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Level 250 and above…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That was the maximum level back during the tutorial era.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Does this mean other players can also participate in the arena? If they’re above level 250, they can try to earn race bonuses too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “However, the participation fee is steep…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How much is it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “100 billion GP.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What, 100 billion GP?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The conference attendees were shocked by the exorbitant price.
 </p>
 <p>
  100 billion GP,
 </p>
 <p>
  with the current exchange rate being 2 dollars per GP, meant participating in the Arena would cost 200 billion dollars.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait, did Seong Jihan pay this hefty sum to participate in the arena?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I watched the video where he verified his VIP card. It seems his VIP status waived the fee.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Heh, saved 200 billion dollars then.”Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  “This makes widespread participation difficult.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The officials sighed, regretting the lost opportunity.
 </p>
 <p>
  They had hoped to enter numerous players to collect as many race bonuses as possible, but the ticket price was excessively high.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Still, wouldn’t it be beneficial to sponsor one or two players to participate on behalf of the association?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “And how do you propose we gather 200 billion dollars?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The arena is a route to obtaining race bonuses. It’s worth considering funding from people for participation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… funding, that’s an idea.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The notion of collecting funds to obtain the race bonus, which had significantly impacted health enhancement for everyone, found no objection in the association meeting.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Once we gather the funds through fundraising, which player should participate? Seong Jihan is currently our strongest card, but he doesn’t need it since his entry is free.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That is…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Once the daunting task of raising 200 billion dollars to participate in the arena became conceivable, deliberation began over who should be sent.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Obviously, it should be Oliver, the second-ranked player, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The United States was the first to promote their candidate.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oliver is a mage, isn’t he? I noticed that arena battles are mostly 1:1, which might not suit a mage.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s a prejudice. Mages aren’t inherently weaker in 1:1 battles, especially not top-tier mages who know how to counter!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Besides, you’ve seen Seong Jihan’s opponents. Many are of considerable size, against which magic could be more effective.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What about our Je Galheon? Although Oliver is the top mage, if Je Galheon draws a good hexagram, he could cast even more powerful magic.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s only if he draws a good hexagram.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Or what about Barren? Though he’s lower in level than the two mages, having two status windows and being a supporter class makes him more suited for solo combat.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I heard Seong Jihan criticizing Barren for lacking control.”
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  “That’s old news! Barren has improved significantly!”
 </p>
 <p>
  From Oliver and Je Galheon to Barren, top contemporary mages were mentioned amidst the commotion.
 </p>
 <p>
  Amidst this, a Korean association representative quietly raised a hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How about Yoon Sejin?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Indeed, he’s qualified.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But can he handle giant opponents?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “1:1 battles are where warriors shine. We believe the Sword King is the right choice.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No. That would mean Korean players monopolizing the benefits. It’s unfair to give one country all the advantages!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s not a benefit. Seong Jihan acquired these benefits for humanity on his own, without the association’s help. Honestly, has the association done anything for him?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, that’s true, but…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We support the Sword King.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the meeting devolved into chaos over the choice of participant, a sudden revelation halted the dispute.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh… Eh…! Seong Jihan has…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Acquired another race bonus!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan had obtained his second bonus.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  In the Space Arena Master League match, Seong Jihan continued to dominate his opponents.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite mostly facing alts groomed by constellations, none were a match for Seong Jihan, who had already overcome a constellation himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Looks like I need to reach the Grand Master League to find worthy adversaries.’
 </p>
 <p>
  After winning his sixth consecutive battle, he earned yet another special reward.
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  [A special reward, ‘Race Evolution Bonus’ is granted.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The strength stat increases by +1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Alien species were flabbergasted by this.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why is this player so lucky?
 </p>
 <p>
  -In the arena, reaching the finals without a single evolution bonus is common…
 </p>
 <p>
  -And already six victories in a row? This player is indeed strong.
 </p>
 <p>
  -The human race… will soon escape the lowest rank.
 </p>
 <p>
  -One player changing the fate of an entire race.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s channel, which had exceeded 15,000 concurrent alien viewers, saw his odds drastically lower as his capabilities were verified, diminishing the thrill of betting.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, curiosity about Seong Jihan’s power grew.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Exactly how many powers does he wield?
 </p>
 <p>
  -When using the Shadow Sword, it looked like he was manipulating Void… and with his spear, he overwhelmed a dragon with flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Especially the fire power, it’s incredibly strong. Could there be a connection to the Red Administrator?
 </p>
 <p>
  -lol Using fire and lightning doesn’t mean he’s comparable to the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  -It’s rare to find a player this strong in the Master League… doesn’t this qualify him to be a Great Constellation?
 </p>
 <p>
  -From Red Administrator to Great Constellation, really jumping to conclusions ㅡㅡ;
 </p>
 <p>
  Alien viewers were now intrigued by the powers wielded by Seong Jihan, who appeared as a mutation among the lowest-rank species, becoming an interesting spectacle with his undefined limits.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, human viewers were,
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow, strength enhancement!
 </p>
 <p>
  -He got another bonus lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -But do you actually feel the strength enhancement? I’m always sitting in my gaming chair, so not sure lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -I tested this at the gym, watching this. Lifting weights felt easier? Gonna try adding 20kg to the barbell.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh, this one’s definitely noticeable… i can probably carry a baby with one hand lol lol
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s achievement made a clear impact, increasing strength by approximately 10 to 20 percent, making this effect tangible for everyone, unlike the lightning attribute affinity.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, Uncle, this one really makes a difference.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The day before the Space Arena finals.
 </p>
 <p>
  Logging out from the Space Arena, Seong Jihan watched as Yoon Seah flexed her newfound muscle.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Since when did you get those muscles?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle, I’m a top-tier archer, after all. I need this much muscle.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so?”
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  “Yep. I’m catching up to the front-runners fast with the Late Bloomer gift. Not many left till I’m number one~”
 </p>
 <p>
  Proudly showing off her muscles a few times, Yoon Seah gleamed at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But with this momentum, could we become low-rank species?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This time, you guys were too lucky. Normally in the arena, getting even one race evolution bonus is considered lucky.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really… Queen? But with Uncle here, couldn’t we eventually become low-rank at least?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Low-rank… If your race continues to participate in BattleNet, you might even aim for mid-rank.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Shadow Queen, having emerged from Seong Jihan, glanced at him briefly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “With this man leading, he’ll fetch all bonuses for you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It feels too reliant on Uncle… I’ll grow fast and fetch evolution bonuses myself!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, before that, you should think about how to escape BattleNet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Escape?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  BattleNet, which led humanity to destruction in his previous life, remained a system Seong Jihan eventually had to escape.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But everything is going so well, why leave?”
 </p>
 <p>
  ”…Hmm?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah tilted her head in confusion at the notion.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, really. There’s nothing challenging for Uncle in the league, and humanity is reaping benefits from the race bonuses.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Humanity is fortunate to have an irregular like Seong Jihan. Normally, the lowest rank would be eliminated, but a single star is leading everyone forward.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right! With Uncle here, leaving BattleNet…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aren’t you going to miss it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned slightly at her remark.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey. Don’t you remember the league’s last place defeat without me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Eh, if Uncle stays, everything’s fine!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah optimistically suggested that Seong Jihan’s presence solved everything.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you truly contemplate leaving BattleNet? Even with such power?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Shadow Queen stared at Seong Jihan, puzzled by his intentions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “To me, you possess the talent to even aim for the Great Constellation. As you advance, the human race will undergo a drastic evolution, acquiring bodies fit for survival in BattleNet in place of their frail current forms… Rising from low to mid-rank would grant humanity competitive strength in the BattleNet world.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, your suggestion is for humanity to stay here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Without you, maybe not. But with a sure safety such as player Seong Jihan here… If I were in charge of humanity, that would be my decision.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan gave a bitter smile at her words.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I continue to live, that is.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He’s safe for now as a constellation candidate.
 </p>
 <p>
  But upon leveling up and eventually becoming a constellation, that safety net disappears.
 </p>
 <p>
  And at that point, it might lead to a clash with the Martial God over Martial Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  Humanity may be optimistic, trusting in Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the grim reality before him was merely a temporary reprieve from death’s doorstep.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s talk about this later.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay. Rest well, Uncle~”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Yoon Seah waved and left the room, a message suddenly popped up.
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s been a while since I sent a direct message. I have an urgent request.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The message was from Pythia, the fourth Martial God’s kin.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Please use my power in the Arena finals.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your power means, Ice Sword Rain of the Frozen Heaven…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. And there, please find one thing for me.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan blinked at her request.
 </p>
 <p>
  Find something in the finals?
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you retrieve it, the Martial God will be able to slumber a bit longer.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon reading Pythia’s follow-up message, Seong Jihan’s eyes widened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Is this another prophecy?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was left with no choice but to accept her terms.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood. I’ll make use of it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, Seong Jihan agreed to her proposal.

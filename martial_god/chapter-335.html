  Chapter 335
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This one is strong…!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Until now, Seong Jihan had managed to counteract the attacks from Little Sun with the power of Red.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, this explosion was distinctly different.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The flames, effortlessly piercing through the resistance of the stat Red, incinerated Seong Jihan’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  Within the blast, his flesh seemed about to vanish momentarily, but
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan found a way to counter in the blink of an eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fundamental Divine Arts, Annihilation God’s Secret – Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit
 </p>
 <p>
  Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit reached towards the Eternity residing within his body in the form of a tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The seal on the stat ‘Eternity’ is temporarily lifted.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, a surge of life force erupted from within, initiating the regeneration of the incinerated body.
 </p>
 <p>
  A regenerative power reminiscent of the World Tree Elves.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the charred skin transformed back into its pristine state, the spectacle drew interest from the alien races.
 </p>
 <p>
  -The power of the Sun King seemed fully deployed there, yet he’s regenerating… Is the human species specialized in regeneration?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Such regeneration isn’t something you’d expect from the lowest-tier species. Just for regeneration alone, it should be rated above average. It must be a trait unique to him.
 </p>
 <p>
  -It’s like watching a World Tree Elf. If he can resist the Sun King’s power to this degree, does that make him equivalent to an ancient elf?
 </p>
 <p>
  -No. When Little Sun and a high elf faced off before, the high elf couldn’t display any regenerative abilities. Isn’t this level more akin to that of a Grand elf?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Grand elf? That’s stretching it… each of them is almost at the level of a Constellation.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ah, why won’t he die. Please die die die!!
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is he really surviving this? Really?? The lowest-tier??
 </p>
 <p>
  Alien races, estimating Seong Jihan’s regenerative capacities between a high elf and a Grand elf, began to despair one by one as he continued to withstand even this.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can regenerate, but I can’t extinguish this fire…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned as he observed his body flaring up and regenerating.
 </p>
 <p>
  He could survive through the power of Eternity, but the Sun King’s fire was a problem.
 </p>
 <p>
  Furthermore,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Little Sun has already disappeared… Why hasn’t the game ended?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Had there been an enemy to confront, battling while aflame might have been feasible.
 </p>
 <p>
  But Little Sun vanished after its explosion, leaving no opponent within the light-transformed arena.
 </p>
 <p>
  With no adversaries to face, his body simply burned.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Could this fire be the Little Sun itself…?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Having employed the power of Eternity tens of times already, Seong Jihan pondered this when,
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Constellation of the Dead Star’ sends an urgent message to the player.]
 </p>
 <p>
  An urgent message arrived from the Constellation of the Dead Star.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The fire of the Sun King, once ignited, does not extinguish, and the Sun King’s mark might be imprinted on your current body, so be cautious, he warns.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [If the mark is completed, it will remain even upon returning to the real world. He advises that suicide might be preferable the moment the mark begins to form.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [He urges you to make a wise decision quickly because once the seal is placed, you cannot become its leader.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Mark?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon reading Karlein’s warning, Seong Jihan examined his body.
 </p>
 <p>
  After regenerating from being burnt to a crisp 50 times,
 </p>
 <p>
  On the 51st time,
 </p>
 <p>
  Sssss…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, the flames engulfing his entire body converged into one spot.
 </p>
 <p>
  The flames focused towards his chest.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This is…]
 </p>
 <p>
  The concentrated blaze began etching characters into his chest.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is this the mark the Constellation of the Dead Star warned about…!’
 </p>
 <p>
  A script that wouldn’t vanish even with Eternity’s regenerative power.
 </p>
 <p>
  The characters slowly started to expand in number.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Constellation of the Dead Star’ sponsors you with 100,000,000,000GP and sends a message.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Didn’t you read my message? Hurry up and kill yourself! Once it’s fully inscribed, you’ll become a slave to the Sun King! It inscribes quickly, so die now! Please!!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Karlein, thinking that his message wasn’t read, sent another, alongside a hefty sponsorship.
 </p>
 <p>
  The aliens also echoed this sentiment.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yeah! Die! Die! Die!
 </p>
 <p>
  -Please let me profit from the tied bet!!
 </p>
 <p>
  -But from Seong Jihan’s perspective, dying is better than becoming a slave to the Sun King, right? lol What’s the use of winning the finals then?
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  -Wow, but to become a slave to someone like the Sun King, he must have gained some recognition.
 </p>
 <p>
  -This player named Seong Jihan, I do want to dissect him.
 </p>
 <p>
  -He does have research value.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aliens argued it’s more rational to die than to become the Sun King’s slave.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan made a swift decision.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll use the last resort, and if it doesn’t work, I’ll choose death.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was regrettable to lose all the GP he’d wagered on himself,
 </p>
 <p>
  But better than becoming the Sun king’s slave before the characters fully formed.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was about to deploy his half-mask and activate his Constellation trait,
 </p>
 <p>
  The characters were already inscribed up to,
 </p>
 <p>
  [This is the Sun King].
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Click.
 </p>
 <p>
  The character touched the solar emblem in the very center of Seong Jihan’s chest.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The six inscribed characters began to tremble intensively.
 </p>
 <p>
  Subsequently,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Detection. Detection. The King’s target, detected.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Beep. Beep-beep. Beep-beep.
 </p>
 <p>
  The six characters started flashing and emitting a loud noise.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The King’s target…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan gazed at his chest.
 </p>
 <p>
  There, after gaining the stat Red, a crescent-shaped mark had emerged.
 </p>
 <p>
  Originally concealed by the solar emblem Seong Jihan discovered while analyzing Longinus’s powers,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Did touching this trigger the Sun King’s inscription…!’
 </p>
 <p>
  The solar emblem, which had remained intact even amidst the flames, was unveiled just as the Sun King’s inscription was made.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recalled the message when he had first concealed it.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The stat ‘Red’ is concealed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Except for administrators, no one can detect the power of Red.]Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  [Entering the code temporarily reveals the concealment.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Never had he imagined that the stat Red, only temporarily visible upon code entry, would be revealed like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hurriedly, Seong Jihan restored the solar mark but,
 </p>
 <p>
  [To ensure accurate detection, switching to search mode.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Ziiing…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The six characters that had blurred during the change to search mode started emitting a strong energy directly towards the chest center.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Detection must be avoided at all costs.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan promptly donned his half-mask and activated his Constellation trait.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instantly, his power amplified significantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The level needed to become a Constellation has been lowered to 769]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  Though the required level for reaching Constellation status dropped by 1 due to activating the trait, now was not the time to fret over it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Using the amplified strength urgently, Seong Jihan confronted the Sun King’s mark, now in search mode.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle. Crackle…
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sun King’s script, initially advancing towards the solar mark, started to retreat gradually.
 </p>
 <p>
  Alien viewers were startled by the sudden surge in Seong Jihan’s power.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Uh… he’s definitely a Grand elf! He’s wearing a mask!
 </p>
 <p>
  -Grand elves don’t disguise their originating planet. He’s definitely human.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Then where did he get that mask from? And how does he manipulate the Void?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Who knows; he’s such an irregular.
 </p>
 <p>
  -I believe he’s a Grand elf on a special mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  From debating whether Seong Jihan was a Grand elf or not,
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow… Even crumbling the Sun King’s mark, isn’t he nearing a Constellation’s power by now?
 </p>
 <p>
  -But the characters were already dissolving before he put on the mask.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Right, it felt like the characters transformed on their own, not due to Seong Jihan’s resistance.
 </p>
 <p>
  -So, definitely not a Constellation level. No matter what.
 </p>
 <p>
  Discussions about Seong Jihan’s power reached peak interest.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Energy depletion.]
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  [Detection failed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sun King’s mark, which had changed to search mode, was losing strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It didn’t last as long as I thought it would for detection.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The characters had blurred, and within what felt like under a minute,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sun King’s force, trying to reach the center of the chest, was completely blocked by Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  The force emitted during search mode was more ferocious and persistent than when it was burning Seong Jihan’s body,
 </p>
 <p>
  but by taking the penalty and amplifying his strength in two stages, Seong Jihan was able to effectively block it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Had I known this, I would have used my full power from the beginning…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan grimaced.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Void increases by 2.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The penalties for the two-stage power-up were an increase in the Void by 2 and a decrease in the level needed to reach Constellation status by 1 level.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the figures were negligible for now, accumulated, it would lead to significant consequences, so he had been cautious.
 </p>
 <p>
  Such prudence, however, had backfired in the face of Little Sun’s explosion.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Next time, if a Great Constellation is involved, I’ll use full power right away.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He had thought that, being an alt, it would be manageable even if related to a Great Constellation.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was a misjudgment.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan reflected, intending to completely eradicate the Sun King’s mark,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Search termination.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Reporting detection failure to the Sun King.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The weakening mark of the Sun King emitted a bright beam of light.
 </p>
 <p>
  Failed, but still reporting.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Can’t leave it be.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If the Great Constellation takes interest in trying the failed detection again, it would be troublesome.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan made this assessment, attempting to block it, but
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash! Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Damn.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The light had already flown somewhere.
 </p>
 <p>
  Was it now just to hope that the Great Constellation wouldn’t act upon receiving the report?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Not a comforting thought…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sun King, who aspires to the position of the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  Frankly, Seong Jihan wasn’t sure if he would remain inactive after receiving this report.
 </p>
 <p>
  But spilled water cannot be retrieved.
 </p>
 <p>
  Accepting it as inevitable, as Seong Jihan prepared for what was next,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hm?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, a martial art entirely unrelated to the current situation came to mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Why would Return of the Light come to mind now…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The third Annihilation technique, Return of the Light.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a technique Seong Jihan had never succeeded in using.
 </p>
 <p>
  The theoretical operation of power was simple.
 </p>
 <p>
  It involved reversing the flow of fire energy within the body, opposite to its normal flow.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But it only resulted in my skin turning red, nothing significant.’
 </p>
 <p>
  So, he wondered if it only had use in a life-or-death situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just now, what protected Seong Jihan’s body was the Eternity stat, not Return of the Light.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unable to grasp any clues, he had placed Return of the Light on the back burner in his mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  But strangely, at this moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  He felt it absolutely necessary to use this technique.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Well, might as well try. The operation is simple enough.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Though unsure why he suddenly felt the urgency to use Return of the Light,
 </p>
 <p>
  He decided to follow his instincts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fundamental Divine Arts, Annihilation God’s Secret – Return of the Light
 </p>
 <p>
  And, as he used Return of the Light,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The light, which had flown far away just moments ago, returned to him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Along with it,
 </p>
 <p>
  The mark of the Sun King, which had lost its strength within his body,
 </p>
 <p>
  Began to redraw itself in the form of [This is the Sun King] instead of the order it had initially appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Starting from [This is], not in the order of disappearance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Witnessing the change within his body, Seong Jihan’s eyes widened.
 </p>
 <p>
  Return of the Light.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Reversing time…?’

  Chapter 340
 </p>
 <p>
  [Seong Jihan, Already Becoming a Constellation? The Daegi Guild is Contacting Players for Willingness to Receive Sponsorship.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The First Player Sponsored by Constellation Seong Jihan, Yoon Sejin. When Asked for His Thoughts, He Claims, “I Haven’t Felt Much Impact Yet, but Being Officially Recognized as a Constellation Would Have Tremendous Effects.”]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Despite Announced Insignificant Constellation Effects, Majority of Players Express Desire to Be Sponsored by Seong Jihan.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The next day,
 </p>
 <p>
  It was revealed that the Daegi Guild had secretly offered Constellation sponsorship to players.
 </p>
 <p>
  These players were all remarkably talented but lacked a Constellation of their own.
 </p>
 <p>
  People showed interest as articles poured out on this matter.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow, can you sponsor even as a Constellation candidate? That’s intriguing.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yoon Sejin said the effects aren’t that noticeable yet…
 </p>
 <p>
  -But it’s definitely more trustworthy than the alien Constellations LOL
 </p>
 <p>
  -Not just aliens. Remember how everyone was brainwashed during Gilgamesh’s time… Can’t trust a Constellation of human origin either – –;
 </p>
 <p>
  -Seeing Seong Jihan’s leveling speed, he’ll become a Constellation soon, better to get sponsored in advance.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow, already level 400? :O
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if sponsorship seemed minimal for now,
 </p>
 <p>
  Given Seong Jihan’s rapid ascension, it seemed a foregone conclusion he’d become a Constellation soon.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, despite an improvement in the aliens’ perception of humanity,
 </p>
 <p>
  Most of that positive image was attributed to Player Seong Jihan, with other human players still being undervalued.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, sponsorship by alien Constellations wasn’t actively happening.
 </p>
 <p>
  Amidst this, excluding Yoon Sejin and Lee Hayeon, three slots were quickly filled.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Seong Jihan Recruits 5 More for Constellation Sponsorship.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [This Time Targeting Supporters? Offers Sponsorship to Players Responsible for Guild Development.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan didn’t stop at the original five but continued to recruit more sponsors.
 </p>
 <p>
  This time focusing on players with supporting gifts, mainly those specializing in ‘development’.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why would he sponsor Supporters? The Daegi Guild is at its peak; isn’t it like nurturing someone else’s talents for no reason?
 </p>
 <p>
  -There must be a reason if Seong Jihan’s doing it…nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
 </p>
 <p>
  -Maybe it’s to help humanity develop faster by also nurturing other guilds’ Supporters?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Since when was Seong Jihan so saintly LOL
 </p>
 <p>
  -Saintly? How dare you compare him — Humanity has benefited immensely from him, far beyond what 100 saints could have achieved.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Did Confucius ever make me healthy?
 </p>
 <p>
  Most were puzzled by Seong Jihan’s decision to sponsor Supporters from other guilds.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, due to the overwhelming favorable opinions shaped by the race bonuses accrued, most assumed he had good intentions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “All 5 people, including those Supporters from American First and the People’s Association, agreed to receive sponsorship.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood. Let’s proceed immediately.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, after reviewing the list from Lee Hayeon, added 5 more.
 </p>
 <p>
  Originally intended for five,
 </p>
 <p>
  He decided to invest in the Constellation shop after seeing how much fame Lee Hayeon could bring.
 </p>
 <p>
  What he invested in was precisely the sponsorship slot expansion item.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though 1,000 points of Constellation fame were required for the upgrade,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s worth the expenditure.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering that the slot expansion allowed for five more to be taken in, it was a worthwhile investment.
 </p>
 <p>
  If each could bring even just 20% of what Lee Hayeon could, the investment points would be recouped in a month.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan went further to upgrade the Constellation traits as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Constellation Traits Enhanced.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The efficiency of Dominion and Sole Sovereignty traits moderately increases.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [As levels of Dominion and Sole Sovereignty rise, the efficiency increases significantly.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Constellation Traits are in OFF state. The enhancement effects are inactive.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No immediate effect since it’s upgraded, but it will differ once the traits are ON.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The enhancement of Dominion and Sole Sovereignty traits.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, due to their current OFF mode, no significant effects were observed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nevertheless, since this upgrade was essential for advancing the Constellation shop to LV.2,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan viewed it as an investment for the future while perusing the Constellation shop items.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Constellation Shop LV.1]
 </p>
 <p>
  Constellation Shop Upgrade – 50000P
 </p>
 <p>
  Dominion LV.2 – 100000P
 </p>
 <p>
  Sole Sovereignty LV.2 – 100000P
 </p>
 <p>
  Constellation Traits Enhancement LV.2 – 50000P
 </p>
 <p>
  Sponsorship Slot Expansion LV.2 – 20000P
 </p>
 <p>
  Special Sponsorship Item Creation – 500P
 </p>
 <p>
  The requirements for points increased significantly as LV.2 became available.
 </p>
 <p>
  To upgrade these, upgrading the Constellation shop to LV.2 was essential.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I don’t have 50,000 points yet.’
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  After using his Constellation fame, Seong Jihan didn’t have enough points for shop upgrades.
 </p>
 <p>
  The only remaining item to spend points on was the ‘Special Sponsorship Item Creation’.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s try it out.’
 </p>
 <p>
  500 points.
 </p>
 <p>
  A significant figure, yet manageable.
 </p>
 <p>
  With ten sponsorship candidates gathered, Seong Jihan was curious to see what item would appear and clicked on it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [A Special Sponsorship Item Will Be Created…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Gift Bestowal – Random A-grade (Combat-Type)’ item created.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [This item can only be used on players under Constellation sponsorship.]
 </p>
 <p>
  With this message, a scroll entered Seong Jihan’s inventory.
 </p>
 <p>
  Using this, could a Constellation give a gift to a player?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A-grade for 500. It’s a waste.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Most players worthy of Constellation sponsorship already had superior gifts.
 </p>
 <p>
  For humans, it ranged from a basic S upwards, typically averaging SS grade to even attract the attention of alien Constellations.
 </p>
 <p>
  Who would receive an A-grade gift?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s practically useless. Can it be auctioned?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan checked if the scroll could be sold, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Special Sponsorship Items cannot be registered in the auction house.]
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t sellable.
 </p>
 <p>
  A Gift Bestowal Voucher that would simply take up space in the inventory.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Should I try one more time?’
 </p>
 <p>
  After drawing something useless, Seong Jihan decided to generate another special item.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [A Special Sponsorship Item Will Be Created…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Gift Enhancement – 2 Month Voucher’ item created.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [This item can only be used on players under Constellation sponsorship.]
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, an item that seemed more useful than before emerged.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Gift enhancement, huh… I have someone in mind for this.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan eyed Lee Hayeon, who was quietly observing him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her SSS-grade development gift had been greatly beneficial to him.
 </p>
 <p>
  If enhanced, the growth rate bonus would likely increase even further.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Currently at level 400, I won’t benefit from this right now… But, for the overall development of players in the Daegi Guild, let’s use it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking of further boosting the already maximized growth rate, along with other bonuses, Seong Jihan used the gift enhancement voucher.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Special Sponsorship has been granted to the sponsored player.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Constellation fame earned from the sponsored player temporarily increases.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Observing him, Lee Hayeon’s eyes widened with surprise.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Boss I received a Constellation bonus?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thought I’d try it out. How’s it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Incredible! It says the gift efficiency increases by 50%!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “50%?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Given the 2-month duration, the immediate effects of the enhancement voucher were more substantial than expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  Regretting not doing this sooner crossed his mind, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can always draw it again later.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With the satisfactory results, Seong Jihan turned his attention to the fame Lee Hayeon could now earn.
 </p>
 <p>
  The fame, which was initially being accrued at 1 to 2 per hour,
 </p>
 <p>
  Increased to 2 to 3 following the gift enhancement.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This more than recovers the fame used.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Though the first attempt was a failure, the second proved fruitful.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ready to stop after a successful draw, a message caught his attention.
 </p>
 <p>
  [One more Special Sponsorship Item Creation available in LV.1 shop.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Knowing this could be his last chance before upgrading the shop,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s use up before upgrading.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He generated another special sponsorship item.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Constellation Power Grant Voucher – Unique’ item created.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [This item can only be used on players under Constellation sponsorship.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Can only be applied to stats of Unique grade or higher belonging to the Constellation.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  An item worthy of the title ‘Special Sponsorship Item’ appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  An item capable of granting players a Unique stat, though it came with a prerequisite.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the Constellation’s powers, only those of Unique grade or higher could be bestowed.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  However, for Seong Jihan, this condition wasn’t much of a limitation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘My abilities are all Unique grade or above anyway.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Martial Soul and Void.
 </p>
 <p>
  Red and Eternity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each one was a spectacular ability, transcending even the Unique grade.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among these, could he pass on one to a sponsored player?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm… What to give and to whom? First, what abilities are even possible?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to use the item to see.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Which ability would you like to bestow?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, four stats appeared, but apart from Martial Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  Void, Red, and Eternity were all marked with an X.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Can’t these abilities be bestowed?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Eternity, being an incomplete stat, made sense,
 </p>
 <p>
  But were Red and Void also unsuitable for human players?
 </p>
 <p>
  Hovering over the X marks, explanations appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Eternity – Cannot be bestowed due to being an incomplete ability.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Void – Cannot be bestowed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Red – Can be bestowed as a ‘Dragon flame’ stat, but only applicable to the ‘Dragon’ race.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Reasons for their unavailability were specified.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Considering Red would include Dragon Flame… That can’t be bestowed, leaving only Martial Soul, huh.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan gazed at Martial Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Martial Soul – Can be bestowed as a downgraded ‘Martial Power’ stat of Unique grade. However, bestowing Martial Power requires a special method.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Martial Soul, which had been enhanced into a superior version integrating both Force and Martial Power.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, among these, only Martial Power could be bestowed upon a sponsored player.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fortunately, the condition to bestow Martial Power wasn’t too stringent.
 </p>
 <p>
  The requirement indicating a ‘special method’ referred to Dongbang Sak’s brush.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Dongbang Sak’s broken brushes were plenty.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recalled from his past life.
 </p>
 <p>
  Possessing the F grade Gift of the Wanderer’s Insight, living day by day on bets and meals.
 </p>
 <p>
  After learning that Dongbang Sak’s brush was the condition to acquire Martial Power, he had inquired around for it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Throughout that investigation, it was clear there were multiple broken brushes of Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking up Dongbang Sak’s brush on the auction house, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Nothing there.’
 </p>
 <p>
  There were no related items of Dongbang Sak currently listed in the auction house.
 </p>
 <p>
  Had all the brushes disappeared already?
 </p>
 <p>
  Or maybe,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They thought it was too high grade but useless to list on the auction house.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan found this possibility likely and told Lee Hayeon,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Make an announcement that if anyone has Dongbang Sak’s broken brush, I’ll buy it at a high price.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Dongbang Sak’s broken brush… Is that the item name?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, it’s an A grade.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it. I’ll broadcast it widely!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, I’ll mention it at the promotion match too. I’m buying Dongbang Sak’s broken brush.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then there’s no worry! The whole world will be watching the promotion match, the broken brush will surface soon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Not satisfied with just joining the Master League,
 </p>
 <p>
  Aiming for the Grand Master League promotion within a month, Seong Jihan’s journey.
 </p>
 <p>
  Given its significance, attracting global attention to this particular promotion exam was natural.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hopefully, the item turns up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, the next day.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proceeding with the Grand Master League Promotion Match…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Player is a Constellation Candidate.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Qualifies for the leagues’ stature.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Automatically promoted to the Grand Master League.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Automatic promotion?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Automatic promotion for being a Constellation candidate?
 </p>
 <p>
  Before, they’d assign me particularly tough maps, but now there’s none of that for a Constellation candidate.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I used to get quite the rewards from there.’
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan showed a touch of regret,
 </p>
 <p>
  [A Special Mission is available for advancement to Space-2 Area.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Would you like to undertake the Special Mission?]
 </p>
 <p>
  A special mission related to the Area was offered to him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll undertake it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Might as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  Accepting it, Seong Jihan was suddenly summoned elsewhere.
 </p>
 <p>
  And in this altered world, what appeared before him was,
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Sister?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Standing petrified yet moving was the Witch of the Void, Seong Jiah.

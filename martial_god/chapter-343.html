  Chapter 343
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan pressed the retry button.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [You win the final demotion match.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [NO.4212 Humanity remains in the Bronze League.]
 </p>
 <p>
  From the moment they won against the Orcs, the game reset to that point.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s a pity, starting from after the Behemoth incident, I could have started with an extra 5 leftover points.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The mission began with their demotion already averted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This, this guy… a mere hunting dog… ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan promptly gagged Barren trying to speak and looked at the chat window.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Hmm… I feel like we’ve removed countless dungeon portals. Wasn’t that it?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Probably isn’t. haha
 </p>
 <p>
  -The distortion of the world from before… it definitely wasn’t the same phenomenon as the world being consumed by the void.
 </p>
 <p>
  -You’re right. It’s definitely not due to the overflow of dungeon portals.
 </p>
 <p>
  Alien spectators, having watched the end of the world alongside them, were quick to draw a line confirming it wasn’t the consumption by the void.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recalled the phenomenon from a moment ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The distortion of the world… it was definitely different from when we lost the demotion match and our bodies were consumed by darkness.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In his past life, when they could only watch helplessly as they lost the demotion match, every player except Seong Jihan disappeared as their bodies were engulfed in darkness.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan could only resist at the time using the Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods, failing to counteract it.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the distortion of the world that happened after winning the demotion match, 24 hours later, was completely different from that consumption.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That power eventually broke even the eternity.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The stat Eternity, which supplied Seong Jihan with an immense amount of life force.
 </p>
 <p>
  With it, he was almost immune to any damage from standard attacks.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the cracks that formed on his body after the countdown ended, couldn’t be healed by Eternity’s life force infusion and instead, it shattered the eternity within him.
 </p>
 <p>
  And his shattered body was sucked into somewhere unknown.
 </p>
 <p>
  An uncontrollable, overwhelming force.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan felt a peculiar sense of déjà vu while experiencing it firsthand.
 </p>
 <p>
  This seems familiar, like I’ve gone through it before.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jihan…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I believed in you!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, one moment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan bound all the American First guild members who approached him with gleaming faces in ties of force.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Isn’t it a bit harsh? This was supposed to be their moment of emotion, and he just binds them with force.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is the mission clear that important right now? lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -But to be happy about surviving now, only for the world to face extinction the next day… It’s kinda sad.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ah, but…what really caused the extinction? Even if it’s not the mission, shouldn’t we know the reason?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ugh… if it’s not demotion or dungeons causing it, could this future unfold for us too?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is it really that?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ugh, Seong Jihan barely survived it, what about ordinary people like me? Instant death?
 </p>
 <p>
  -If you last a second, consider yourself talented lol
 </p>
 <p>
  With Seong Jihan retrying the mission, the atmosphere among the viewers, compared to when they first watched the game, had become graver.
 </p>
 <p>
  And for good reason, since the cause of humanity’s extinction was neither league demotion nor dungeon portals.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the reason wasn’t identified here, the same fate of extinction could unfold in their current world too.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Ah, could it be?’
 </p>
 <p>
  With all those around him bound, lost in thought, Seong Jihan soon came up with a hypothesis.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sensation of the world distorting and his body shattering.
 </p>
 <p>
  The feeling as his fragmented body was carried into the twisted world was…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Taiji Swordsmanship?’
 </p>
 <p>
  [TL/N: the yin and yang power]
 </p>
 <p>
  When possessed by Dongbang Sak, the Taiwanese player who first unfolded the Taiji Swordsmanship.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he launched the Taiji, the whole world was sucked into it.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan resisted, the Taiji spun in reverse, expelling darkness.
 </p>
 <p>
  An overpowering force that completely shattered the map within the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought that the initial distortion of the world from the first game was similar to when the Taiji initially moved in its regular direction.
 </p>
 <p>
  But,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Still, I can’t conclusively say it’s Taiji Swordsmanship. Are there not other powers that can warp the world like that?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan inwardly hoped this wasn’t a phenomenon shown by the Taiji Swordsmanship.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if Dongbang Sak is strong among the Martial God’s disciples, how could he possess the power to sever humanity?
 </p>
 <p>
  And if he’s this powerful, how will we face the Martial God’s disciples later?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to halt his thoughts on the world’s distortion for now and pondered the future steps.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…It’s daunting.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was actually easier when there was a clear goal like in the first game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now that it’s clarified that dungeon portals aren’t the cause of extinction, it’s unclear what to do or where to start.
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Would you like to receive a mission hint?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [It requires 100,000,000 GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A message that wasn’t there in the previous game popped up before Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the second retry, does a hint come into play?
 </p>
 <p>
  -BattleNet really doesn’t hold back, asking for 100 million GP for a hint lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -BattleNet’s really being a mafioso here.
 </p>
 <p>
  -The price is just ridiculous;; if this becomes the reason to forfeit the mission, it can’t be helped.
 </p>
 <p>
  As viewers booed BattleNet’s extortion, Seong Jihan didn’t hesitate and spent the 100 million GP.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [HINT – The extinction started from the location of the first Abyss.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A one-liner hint sprung up in the message box.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow, a 100 million GP hint is just one sentence? That’s harsh lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -The first Abyss? Isn’t that in North Korea?
 </p>
 <p>
  -How’s he supposed to get from America to Korea in 24 hours;;
 </p>
 <p>
  -Can’t Seong Jihan just use his light step?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ah, right? lol
 </p>
 <p>
  From the one-liner hint about the first Abyss, viewers easily guessed the location.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first Abyss that devastated North Korea.
 </p>
 <p>
  The hint was directing Seong Jihan towards that location.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘With maximum use of light step, crossing the Pacific seems possible…’
 </p>
 <p>
  But since he has warp, there’s no need to cross the ocean.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan released Barren from his bindings.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This, this guy… even binding guild members. Planning to kill me, or wait, did that Behemoth from earlier somehow take control of your body?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, warp me over to Korea.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What? How am I supposed to do that across such a distance?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You don’t have a way?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There is none!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren firmly stated it was impossible.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hearing his response, Seong Jihan chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having lived through this era once, he knew there surely was a way.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Might as well use that method then.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan liberated the motionless American First guild members around him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then made a bombshell announcement.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I accept Jin Yuhua’s proposition. Now, would the Chinese spy please step forward.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Huh. What are you saying?! Do you think there’s someone among the American First players who’s in cahoots with China!?”Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  At those words, Barren bristled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m not going if not now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan glanced at the guild members, focusing particularly on one person.
 </p>
 <p>
  A Caucasian man with blond hair and blue eyes, American First’s ranker, Jack.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was visibly trembling.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If we barely escaped demotion now, who knows what crisis might come next. Rather than living insulted as a hunting dog by the guild leader, I choose to seek asylum in China.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ji, Jihan… what are you saying! About China. Please, reconsider!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Th, that’s right, Jihan! How could there be a Chinese spy among us! We are American First!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh… calling a hunting dog, a hunting dog…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shut it, Barren!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia’s scream caused Barren to flinch.
 </p>
 <p>
  Surrounding guild members glared at their guild leader, trying to approach Seong Jihan and persuade him otherwise.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I want to go right away. So, to Chinese officials watching the broadcast, please hand the scroll to the spy. Otherwise, I’ll remain in America.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan waved his hand, appealing his intention to cross over just like someone pleading on BattleTube.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow lol He’s asking the Chinese spy to come forward, planning to cross to North Korea from there?
 </p>
 <p>
  -But come on, a spy in American First? It’s America’s top guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Just throwing it out there?
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers on Seong Jihan’s channel debated whether American First really had a Chinese spy, but then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Last time you said you wouldn’t go?”
 </p>
 <p>
  A blond-haired, blue-eyed Caucasian man sighed and approached.
 </p>
 <p>
  The chat exploded.
 </p>
 <p>
  -…Jack?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is that Jack?
 </p>
 <p>
  -WTF?! Jack was the spy for China?
 </p>
 <p>
  -What, what what what! No! I’m not a spy! I’m American!
 </p>
 <p>
  While the current Jack fervently denied being a spy in the chat,
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Since the orders have come from above, I guess there’s no choice. Friend, could you bind these people again before you go?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Jack in front of him grinned slightly and gestured towards the other players.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

 </div>
 <p>
  “Alright.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jihan… Ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thunk!
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia, attempting to plead affectionately with Seong Jihan, got restrained.
 </p>
 <p>
  Zip!
 </p>
 <p>
  Jack pulled out a scroll from within and tore it apart.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, a blue portal opened in the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright… go on in first. I’ll follow in.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thanks.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan stepped into the portal, thinking,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Jack’s attempt to sway me back in the days of American First turned out to be helpful now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  During his American First days, Jack, for some reason, had been a spy for China despite meeting Barren’s criteria of a purebred American and had secretly approached Seong Jihan with an offer from the Chinese government.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though he had declined the offer at the time, remembering Jack was a spy surprised him, proving useful now.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Who’s Jack that the Americans are freaking out about?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Probably a promising member of American First, right? lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -Woah, chills lol Did Seong Jihan know all this?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Eh, he probably just threw it out there; he was surveying all the guild members.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Right? Man, didn’t expect the least likely person to be it; thought if anyone, some other Asian in the American First guild would.
 </p>
 <p>
  -It’s always the one you least suspect lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow, Jack’s now trending #1 on real-time searches lol
 </p>
 <p>
  As the storm about spy Jack raged on,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan had already stepped on the Chinese soil through the portal.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clap! Clap! Clap!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Player Seong Jihan! Welcome to China!”
 </p>
 <p>
  An East Asian man, greeting him with hearty applause and fluent English.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hearing your acceptance of Ms. Jin Yuhua’s offer so immediately… I should’ve spoken sooner! With Player Seong Jihan joining us, China will now ascend to ranked #1!”
 </p>
 <p>
  He seemed genuinely delighted to welcome Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Here is…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is Shanghai’s BattleNet center. I’ll do my utmost to assist with your settlement here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shanghai, is it? To get from here to Pyongyang, just across the east sea, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Py, Pyongyang… it seems you need to head northeast for that…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Northeast, then.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon hearing that, Seong Jihan shot out towards the building exit like a cannonball.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wh, where are you going…! Sto, stop him!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He’s already gone…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Chinese BattleNet center officials’ screams faded as Seong Jihan soared away.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Northeast, then… Just need to cross the sea.”
 </p>
 <p>
  -That’s correct…
 </p>
 <p>
  -But if you go east from Shanghai, wouldn’t you end up in Japan?
 </p>
 <p>
  -I live in Shanghai. If you see any road signs, I can point you to which way is north.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, thank you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With the help of Chinese viewers, Seong Jihan found his way north.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This way should work then.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He dashed across the sea, moving at top speed with his light step.
 </p>
 <p>
  The rapid flight of Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow, he’s seriously fast lol Literally flying across the sea;
 </p>
 <p>
  -Didn’t Seong Jihan roam around the Japanese islands looking for Shizuru? lol. He’s much stronger than before, so this should be a breeze.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Isn’t that land already visible?
 </p>
 <p>
  -At this rate, isn’t he like a real-world Superman? Wow
 </p>
 <p>
  After a while, he reached land across the West Sea, entirely enveloped in a purple mist.
 </p>
 <p>
  The land had been lost to the breeding of dungeon portals to the point of becoming overrun.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Now, finding where the Abyss is here will be another task.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan furrowed his brows, silently observing the purple mist.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though faint, it carried a hint of the void.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s follow where it’s thickest.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Sensing the power of the void to find a direction, Seong Jihan pressed forward after reaching land.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this the place…”
 </p>
 <p>
  He arrived where the void’s mist was noticeably thicker.
 </p>
 <p>
  There, he saw…
 </p>
 <p>
  […]
 </p>
 <p>
  A giant figure, shrouded in purple.
 </p>
 <p>
  A behemoth of a form, but its flesh, whether arms, legs, or torso, was studded with red eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [You confront the owner of the Abyss ‘??’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A message popped up before Seong Jihan’s eyes.

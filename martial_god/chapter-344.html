 <p>
  Chapter 344
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This giant is the owner of the Abyss?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s eyes widened as he read the message.
 </p>
 <p>
  The owner of the Abyss who had refused to release his sister despite the Arena’s owner’s promise to free her.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hadn’t it been said that the Arena’s owner, one of the strongest in the void, had killed him countless times, yet he kept reviving, never breaking his resolve?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the true identity of the one holding his sister, Seong Jiah, Seong Jihan thought it rather fortunate.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It would be good to test my strength against him in the game before challenging him directly.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If he could gather as much data about the Abyss’s owner here and then analyze it in the training ground of the void, it would be beneficial.
 </p>
 <p>
  Deciding to fight, Seong Jihan observed his opponent closely.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Those red eyes embedded in the giant’s body… I feel like I’ve seen them somewhere.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The massive eyeballs wriggling on the giant’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  Focusing on them, Seong Jihan soon thought they resembled those of ‘the Blood clan.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Though lacking the vitality seen in the eyes of that clan, their form was similar.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Why would the eyes of the Blood clan be present on a being of the void?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The identity of the Abyss’s owner remained a deep mystery.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘First off.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Fundamental Divine Arts,
 </p>
 <p>
  Triad of Martial Mastery:
 </p>
 <p>
  Mount Tai Suppression
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan launched a light pre-emptive strike.
 </p>
 <p>
  The void’s mist split apart, and a sword strike that seemed to bisect the world ensued.
 </p>
 <p>
  But, an attack that had slain the apocalyptic beast Behemoth in one blow.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  It disappeared before it even reached the owner of the Abyss.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Indeed, no easy adversary.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A foe perhaps too strong to face immediately upon becoming a Grandmaster.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan was pondering this.
 </p>
 <p>
  […….]
 </p>
 <p>
  The owner of the Abyss, without even looking at Seong Jihan, pressed his hands on the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  As time passed, the mist of the void grew denser.
 </p>
 <p>
  Leaving it alone might spread the void across the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But the extinction occurring after 24 hours wasn’t a phenomenon caused by the void…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The phenomenon of the world distorting was distinctly different from the encroachment of the void.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although it seemed the Abyss’s owner was a key point in this extinction, judging from the hint, his actions seemed unrelated to the extinction phenomenon Seong Jihan had experienced.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There’s too little information right now. Let’s go with full power for an attack.’
 </p>
 <p>
  After a brief moment of deliberation, Seong Jihan opened his inventory.
 </p>
 <p>
  What he took out were the Phoenix Flag and his half-mask
 </p>
 <p>
  [The level needed to become a Constellation has been lowered to 768]
 </p>
 <p>
  Turning on the Constellation traits and amplifying the void with the half-mask.
 </p>
 <p>
  He channeled power into the Phoenix Flag.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fundamental Divine Arts,
 </p>
 <p>
  Heavenly Dragon Thunder Fire:
 </p>
 <p>
  Dragon Thunder
 </p>
 <p>
  The Phoenix Flag flickered brightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Within it, immense firepower was condensed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dragon Thunder, typically used as the flame of the heavens, was concentrated to a singular point, much like when facing the Constellation Longinus.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even before being thrown, the Phoenix Flag emitted a fierce white flame.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…This still isn’t enough.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even as Seong Jihan witnessed the power contained in Dragon Thunder, he instinctively felt it.
 </p>
 <p>
  The opponent was even stronger than Longinus.
 </p>
 <p>
  This power alone was not enough.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan took out another weapon from his inventory.
 </p>
 <p>
  -A stick?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Did Seong Jihan have such a weapon?
 </p>
 <p>
  -That doesn’t seem useful against that giant eyeball creature…
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the Divine Spear, inherited from Longinus.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s supreme offensive measure, the ‘Code of Destruction’.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Divine Spear allowed for striking at a distance through the spear, acting as a conduit for the Destruction code without requiring close combat.
 </p>
 <p>
  For 10 seconds, the aura of destruction flickered, and upon contact with a target, it served as a medium to obliterate the foe.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, considering the Abyss’s owner had nullified even Mount Tai Suppression, solely relying on it might get intercepted midway.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Therefore, clear a path with the Phoenix Flag, then insert the Code of Destruction.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Phoenix Flag, spewing white flames, moved first, burning all the void’s mist blocking the path.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, as it approached the owner of the Abyss, the firepower of the Phoenix Flag weakened rapidly.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  A few of the red eyes on the ground that had been observing the Phoenix Flag caused the spear’s firepower to diminish even further.
 </p>
 <p>
  By the time the Phoenix Flag nearly reached the owner of the Abyss, most of the white flames emitted from the spear had already vanished.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thunk!
 </p>
 <p>
  Ineffectually striking a red eyeball and being deflected, the Phoenix Flag was flung aside.
 </p>
 <p>
  -The power held within that weapon was beyond imagination, yet it was blocked…
 </p>
 <p>
  -On our planet, the Abyss has never been formed, but are all owners of the Abyss this powerful?
 </p>
 <p>
  -No, this is the first time I’ve seen an entity of the Abyss possessing such power.
 </p>
 <p>
  -If every Abyss had beings like this, our world would have been doomed already;
 </p>
 <p>
  -What’s such a monster doing on a low-tier race’s planet?
 </p>
 <p>
  The Abyss had also appeared on many planets of the aliens.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, among the owners of the Abyss, there has never been one so formidable.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the alien viewers pondered the opponent, predicting Seong Jihan’s defeat, suddenly,
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  Following closely behind the Phoenix Flag, the Divine Spear lodged into the right arm of the owner of the Abyss.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instantly, the giant’s right arm cracked.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom! Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  The eyes on the arm wriggled and then exploded in unison, pouring blood from the arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Uh…
 </p>
 <p>
  -What’s happening? Why did it take damage?
 </p>
 <p>
  -The real deal was the stick behind it…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Seong Jihan… What even is this player?
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers were astonished as the mighty owner of the Abyss took damage.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Seong Jihan’s expression wasn’t bright.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Only the arm vanished. And only partially at that.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Code of Destruction was supposed to obliterate anything it touched.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even the Constellation Longinus couldn’t withstand its power, yet for the owner of the Abyss, only a portion of his flesh was annulled.
 </p>
 <p>
  He hoped continued attacks would eventually eradicate it but then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  Where it vanished, white light emanated, and numerous red eyeballs sprung forth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Subsequently, the missing flesh was regenerated by the red eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  The purple giant was regaining its former form.
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, closely observing, thought,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘When it emerges from the light, it doesn’t seem to have a physical form.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The red eyes, initially translucent as they emerged from the light, began to gain substance only after settling in the missing flesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If it’s an ethereal form when it comes from the light.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should use the Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods. .’
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan ignited Eclipse, raising it into the air, embedding the sword into the void.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fundamental Divine Arts,
 </p>
 <p>
  Annihilation God’s Secret:
 </p>
 <p>
  Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods.
 </p>
 <p>
  A pattern of Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods formed in the void.
 </p>
 <p>
  Enhanced by his power, the pattern swiftly expanded.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The translucent red eyes, instead of forming into flesh on the giant, were sucked in unison into the Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods.
 </p>
 <p>
  The regeneration of the Abyss’s owner halted.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded, realizing,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They were indeed ethereal forms.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Would it mean facing the owner of the Abyss, annihilate while blocking regeneration with the Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods was the answer?
 </p>
 <p>
  As he figured out the basic strategy,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams…]
 </p>
 <p>
  A voice flowed from the opponent, which had shown little reaction even as part of its body vanished.
 </p>
 <p>
  Simultaneously.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  The red eyes, which had been observing the ground, all turned, looking at the pattern of Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whirl. Whirl.
 </p>
 <p>
  The red eyes observing Seong Jihan started spinning clockwise.
 </p>
 <p>
  Initially moving slowly, the eyeballs quickly gained speed, and then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [This time, I must…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The surrounding world suddenly wrinkled.
 </p>
 <p>
  A phenomenon similar to the extinction 24 hours before.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the world was sucked into the spinning eyeballs,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Was this the root cause of the extinction…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The distortion of the world that had even consumed Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike the first game, however,
 </p>
 <p>
  He was enduring it more easily.

 </div>
 <p>
  The pattern of Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods he had created was blocking it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods has this effect…!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Using it as a shield to fight the enemy seemed feasible.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan thought this and picked up the Divine Spear,
 </p>
 <p>
  [You are not Dongbang Sak… Vanish.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The owner of the Abyss spoke as if disappointed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzing…
 </p>
 <p>
  As the spinning eyes changed color, they collectively formed a single pattern.
 </p>
 <p>
  A pattern anyone from the East Asian culture would recognize.
 </p>
 <p>
  -What is that?
 </p>
 <p>
  -The Taiji symbol…?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why is that showing up here;;
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the Taiji.
 </p>
 <p>
  As hundreds, thousands of Taiji formed in the vicinity, the Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods shattered, and Seong Jihan’s body was directly sucked in.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Humanity has faced extinction.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Would you like to retry the mission?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have 1 attempt remaining.]
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  The owner of the Abyss was revealed in the second game.
 </p>
 <p>
  His power left viewers, both alien and human, shocked.
 </p>
 <p>
  -At this rate, he’s just below the Great Constellations… To think the Abyss had such a monster, astonishing.
 </p>
 <p>
  -With that level of power, it doesn’t seem like he should be dispatched by the Abyss; what’s he doing there?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Compared to humanity’s standing… the enemy is too mighty.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Such presence assures extinction.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Seong Jihan… We should scout him for our planet.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But what did the owner of the Abyss say earlier? There was no translation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aliens, having witnessed the owner of the Abyss, affirmed humanity’s inevitable downfall, suggesting to recruit Seong Jihan,
 </p>
 <p>
  -Taiji what now ㅡㅡ was that what caused humanity’s extinction?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Those red eyes are creepy…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ah, this foe is too strong…
 </p>
 <p>
  -But I think I’ve seen that Taiji in the Taiwan battle before.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ah, was it that Taiwanese player? The one who became an avatar.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Right, right. That monster that tore apart a map.
 </p>
 <p>
  A portion of the human viewers remembered the Taiwan battle upon seeing the Taiji.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the scale of a single map’s extinction and humanity’s extinction differed vastly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The nature of distorting the world and consuming everything was similar to Dongbang Sak’s Taiji.
 </p>
 <p>
  And Seong Jihan, who had experienced it firsthand, also recalled Dongbang Sak upon the final Taiji.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Mistaking Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods for the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams, and being disappointed I’m not Dongbang Sak… the owner of the Abyss. There’s definitely a connection to Dongbang Sak.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even after avoiding demotion, humanity is doomed by the owner of the Abyss.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the owner of the Abyss possesses a power akin to the highest-ranking constellations, using the Taiji Swordsmanship.
 </p>
 <p>
  The red eyes seem related to the Blood clan and are weak against Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, the opponent, who showed no interest in Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods, resolved to defeat him with full force…
 </p>
 <p>
  Was this the outcome of the second attempt?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…This one truly seems unbeatable.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan toggled the constellation traits OFF, contemplating this.
 </p>
 <p>
  A foe vastly superior even compared to Longinus.
 </p>
 <p>
  With his current power levels, it seemed utterly impossible to win.
 </p>
 <p>
  This mission looked challenging,
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as Seong Jihan thought to focus on gathering information about the owner of the Abyss rather than breaking the mission,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Would you like to receive a hint for the mission?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [It requires 200,000,000 GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Another message asking if he’d like a hint arrived for Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  -They’re really milking him for all he’s got lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -How much is going down the drain with this game? ㅡㅡ;
 </p>
 <p>
  -Even with a hint, it doesn’t seem like he’d avoid death…
 </p>
 <p>
  -But if it’s Seong Jihan, he might actually pull it off lol
 </p>
 <p>
  And as the viewers anticipated,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll take it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan immediately paid the doubled hint price.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The owner of the Abyss ‘??’s weak spot is his head.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A one-liner hint arrived.
 </p>
 <p>
  -200 million GP for that hint, wow lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -The head is the weak spot… isn’t that too obvious?
 </p>
 <p>
  -lol with such a monster, you wouldn’t know where the weakness lies. Who said it’s always the head?
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the outrageous price, viewers debated whether the hint was that straightforward,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Worth the price.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan chuckled upon seeing it.
 </p>
 <p>
  The owner of the Abyss who ignored him until he attacked.
 </p>
 <p>
  Attacking the revealed weak spot might lead to a different result in the second attempt.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s my last chance. I’ll target the head this time.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With that mindset, Seong Jihan entered his last retry opportunity.

  Chapter 348
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh, the VIP effect kicked in right away lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -Guess we can watch the first game comfortably hehe
 </p>
 <p>
  -Just need that 50 percent chance to activate two more times.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Hey, even if it happens just once more, we only need one win in the remaining 3 games.
 </p>
 <p>
  -A win without Seong Jihan… is that possible?
 </p>
 <p>
  With the immediate activation of the VIP card, viewers felt more at ease watching the game, considering a victory in the first game a foregone conclusion.
 </p>
 <p>
  =The first game is starting!
 </p>
 <p>
  =This game is a Defense mission called ‘Battleship Defense.’
 </p>
 <p>
  =50 players gather on a warship at sea, tasked with defending this vessel.
 </p>
 <p>
  =It’s a map that has appeared a few times in international matches. The key here is to fend off sea monsters…
 </p>
 <p>
  The first game, set on the ‘Battleship Defense’ map.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the commentators were explaining the defense strategy for this map to viewers unfamiliar with international matches,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Battleship defense, huh… Why bother holding off monsters when the ship sinking means we lose anyway?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right… lose?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Be right back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan waved to Yoon Seah and leaped into the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no need to waste time fighting monsters pointlessly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Scanning the surroundings from above, Seong Jihan noted,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is it over there?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Having spotted the Mecan race’s warship, he threw the Phoenix Flag.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fundamental Divine Arts,
 </p>
 <p>
  Heavenly Dragon Thunder Fire:
 </p>
 <p>
  Dragon Thunder
 </p>
 <p>
  A rift opened in the sky, and a gigantic stream of fire poured down directly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The robots on the warship all glanced upwards, then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Defense probability 0 percent. Attack cannot be resisted.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [We forfeit the first game.]
 </p>
 <p>
  They readily lowered their arms.
 </p>
 <p>
  Woosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Instantly, the Mecan’s warship burst into flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  It didn’t take long for a system message to appear.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The enemy’s battleship has sunk.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The first game ends.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The human representative team wins.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The game ended in a flash.
 </p>
 <p>
  Commentators putting up a special explanation of the Battleship Defense were left chuckling awkwardly.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ha, haha. The monsters hadn’t even appeared yet…
 </p>
 <p>
  =The first game ends just like that!
 </p>
 <p>
  =As expected of player Seong Jihan. As soon as he enters, the game becomes too easy!
 </p>
 <p>
  The first game ended without any significant resistance from the opponents.
 </p>
 <p>
  -The way to win a defense map is just to destroy the opponent’s base.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Lol why even bother defending? Just go and destroy it.
 </p>
 <p>
  -What, it’s over already? I was just warming up yesterday’s chicken…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Whenever Seong Jihan plays, you can’t go anywhere. It always ends in a flash lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ah, I wanted to see a fierce battle. Feels so anticlimactic…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Anticlimactic what? Be thankful for the easy win lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -For real, the fate of humanity is on the line. The easier, the better.
 </p>
 <p>
  While some expressed disappointment over the quick conclusion, most viewers celebrated Seong Jihan’s effortless victory, hoping for similarly easy wins in the following games.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Seems like levels don’t go up anymore.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Having obliterated the Mecan in the first game, Seong Jihan noted the lack of system messages indicating a level increase.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps at level 430 now, wiping out an enemy in one game wasn’t enough to raise his level.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, it’s the Mecan race’s first time in the Bronze League, so their player levels wouldn’t be high.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Looks like expecting significant rewards from Space League matches would be difficult from now on.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as Seong Jihan was lamenting the slim pickings today, in the Space League’s coaching rooms called the coaches back.
 </p>
 <p>
  Following the effortless win in the first game, Coach Davis, wearing a relaxed expression, looked at the robot and remarked,
 </p>
 <p>
  “You lost to our second-best.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I have already heard from the World Tree Alliance. Humanity’s number one has a 50 percent chance to avoid being banned.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Those guys really, spilling every detail. Anything else they mentioned?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Aside from number one, the human race is considerably weak.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Not exactly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  -Look at Davis’ delayed response lol
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  -And those World Tree Elves, after getting beaten by us, disclosed all our weaknesses to other races _ _’
 </p>
 <p>
  -Even so, is it not overly dismissive of humanity? Thinking we can’t win without Seong Jihan being banned?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yeah, can’t win…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Remember the Zojin Tribe incident??
 </p>
 <p>
  The jolt from losing to the least ranked had viewers doubting the human representative team’s skill, even if they trusted Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hence, they merely hoped future games would see Seong Jihan escaping bans.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Seong Jihan’ has been banned.]
 </p>
 <p>
  But luck didn’t follow them continuously.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ah… it’s lost.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Will we be trampled by robots in the second game?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Those Mecan folks not resisting in the first game makes it hard to gauge their strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Even if they had resisted, they’d have been swept away by the dragon breath… wouldn’t make a difference in understanding their strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mecan, whose capabilities remained unseen due to Seong Jihan ending the first game swiftly, left people anxious about what strength these steel robots could unleash.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, in the human team’s locker room,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Brother-in-law, please look after the second game.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course. Oh… but I’ve got a question. Your constellation support, sometimes it boosts my power significantly… when will that happen again?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really? When does that happen?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, um… it mostly happens when you are playing the game.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, hearing Yoon Sejin’s words, realized when his power had amplified.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘When I activated the Constellation traits.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Turning on the Constellation traits allowed him to wield the power of a constellation at the expense of a lower level cap.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed that whenever Seong Jihan activated the Constellation traits in the presence of formidable foes, Yoon Sejin, among others, benefitted from its effects too.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I understand what you’re saying. I can somewhat control it, but it reduces the growth limit. I plan to use it cautiously.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The growth limit is reduced?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, then don’t use it at all. We’ll show them we can win without your constellation support. Even if… we’re about to lose, don’t use it. A slight dip in the league ranking can be tolerated.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Concerned by the mention of a reduced growth limit, Yoon Sejin urged not to use that feature.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “And this conversation… don’t mention it to anyone. If the coaching staff knows, they might ask you to activate it just once in a crucial moment. Granting it once quickly becomes two, then three.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Space League games were important to humanity,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘My level cap is more crucial.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Preserving the rank, only to face humanity’s extinction.
 </p>
 <p>
  Right now, more than the league’s ranking, it was crucial for Seong Jihan to grow stronger to stand against entities like the owner of the Abyss or Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no need to waste future potential just for the league.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well then, I’ll come back with a victory, Mr. Constellation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Tap.
 </p>
 <p>
  Smiling slyly and offering a quick salute, Yoon Sejin stepped into the second game.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah…
 </p>
 <p>
  =What’s with these robots! They wield laser swords!
 </p>
 <p>
  =That robot clashing with the Sword King… its arms keep extending!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Even with arms and legs severed, magical circles appear from Mecan’s chest.
 </p>
 <p>
  =The corpses of enemy player robots gather to reassemble into a new robot…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Facing the Mecan race for the first time, humanity found them to be a formidable challenge.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if reduced to an inoperative state, robot debris would clump together, forming new robots.
 </p>
 <p>
  The robot dueling with the Sword King initially seemed to be at a disadvantage but,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Data collection complete. Movements, understood.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, it began to overwhelm him with its swordsmanship.
 </p>
 <p>
  Initially, the human team fought equally, but gradually began to fall behind due to Mecan’s superior endurance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eventually,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The second game ends.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The human representative team loses.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The second game concluded with a victory for the Mecan race.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  In the Space League coaching room.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The World Tree Alliance’s information was accurate.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The robotic coach, facing a sour-faced Coach Davis, commented.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Already expected that once Seong Jihan got banned…
 </p>
 <p>
  -But shouldn’t we at least win the first one?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why don’t these robots shoot guns instead of fighting with laser swords? Aren’t heavy weapons allowed?
 </p>
 <p>
  -For real, with that technology, wouldn’t they just win using advanced weaponry? lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -There must be BattleNet restrictions.
 </p>
 <p>
  -That’s somewhat lucky for humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers, witnessing the representative team’s defeat, weren’t particularly dismayed anymore.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though there was a respectable fight at the beginning, ultimately they were overpowered by Mecan in terms of endurance.
 </p>

 <p>
  Seasoned BattleNet participants could predict the outcome.
 </p>
 <p>
  -So, it all boils down to Seong Jihan surviving, huh?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why do we always have to rely on our Seong Jihan; I feel sorry for him.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Truth is, humanity still lacks the skills to stand on its own. Honestly, our race ranks at the bottom.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ah lol, wish Seong Jihan would just upgrade our race rank lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -For real lol, and give us a 200-year lifespan with ageless bodies while he’s at it lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -Looking after humanity’s ranking, upgrading its grade, preventing extinction… Seong Jihan’s gonna work himself to death, you guys ㅡㅡ;
 </p>
 <p>
  -lol If I were him, I’d have fled to outer space already, agreed?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Agreed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers hoped for Seong Jihan to survive the bans and return to save the day.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, having finished the game, Yoon Sejin looked dejected before Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Sorry, Jihan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s there to be sorry for? Winning and losing are parts of the game.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Winning and losing… feels like we always end up losing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “When will the representative team manage a win without Uncle?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well…”
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s a challenging question.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan chuckled bitterly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘In my previous life, humanity secured its first victory against the weakened Orcs after their chieftain was executed by the elves.’
 </p>
 <p>
  World Tree Elves, saving their ban and select cards to execute a player from the opposing race, weakened the Orcs sufficiently for humanity to stand a chance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite vigorous fights against a few other races for the spot of the lowest rank.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the end, humanity was truly the weakest.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s surprising that super-strong beings like Dongbang Sak could emerge from such a weak race.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan pondered while awaiting the ban result for the third game.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’d be great if VIP kicked in again.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Seong Jihan’ has been banned.]
 </p>
 <p>
  That 50 percent chance seemed reluctant to trigger.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh no…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Players sighed upon hearing the ban results, disheartened by the direct experience of being overpowered by Mecan in the second game.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Looks like bans will continue into the 4th and 5th games.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Coach Davis tried to smile, but
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s a variable.]nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
 </p>
 <p>
  “What…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Regardless of previous probabilities, the 4th game will still have a 50 percent chance applied.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I, I know that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You spoke as if you were unaware just moments ago.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Annoying machine. Nitpicking everything.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Davis scowled, the Mecan coach made a proposal.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Rather than relying on such chances, there is a more certain method.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you suggesting?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Humanity’s ranking number one. Give us his blood and flesh. In return, we will concede this series. Furthermore, we will ensure a consistent defeat against humanity in this Bronze League.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Davis’ eyes widened at the request.
 </p>
 <p>
  They wanted Seong Jihan’s blood and flesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  What kind of proposal were these robots making?
 </p>
 <p>
  [We will lift the ban on number one for the 4th game. Please consider it positively.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I haven’t agreed to anything yet…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Consider the exchange of inevitable victories for humanity, a weak race, for the blood and flesh of number one, which can regenerate indefinitely. Shall I explain how crucial these guaranteed wins are for a race as frail as humanity?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Bzzt.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he spoke, the Mecan coach eagerly displayed several hologram screens.
 </p>
 <p>
  [According to the data from the 2nd game, the power of humanity players, excluding rank number one, is at the league’s lowest.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Bzzt.
 </p>
 <p>
  Armed with the 2nd game’s data, neatly presented analyses displayed plainly.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This is ‘The Reality of Humanity’ as analyzed by Mecan.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Coach Davis was subjected to a 10-minute lecture by the opposing team coach on how weak the human representative team is without their number one.
 </p>
 <p>
  -These robot folks, better analysts than humanity’s BattleNet squad…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Beaten by data, these mechanical beings…
 </p>
 <p>
  -To maintain a high league ranking, should we not miss such opportunities…
 </p>
 <p>
  -But why do they want blood and flesh?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Are they planning to create a clone of Seong Jihan? ㅡㅡ
 </p>
 <p>
  -Definitely not. Better to lose than give in!
 </p>
 <p>
  Humanity’s representative team, unclear in data terms but too suspicious to hand over Seong Jihan’s blood and flesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Davis finally responded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I refuse.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Calm down, and reconsider before the next game.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Beep.
 </p>
 <p>
  Turning off the hologram screens, the Mecan coach said nonchalantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I await your wise decision.]

  Chapter 349
 </p>
 <p>
  “Player Seong Jihan… about the Mecan’s earlier proposal.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon leaving the coaching room, Coach Davis asked Seong Jihan, just in case.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m not doing it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right, right?! That’s what I was going to say too. Haha! Blood and flesh, who knows what they would use it for, how could we possibly hand it over!”
 </p>
 <p>
  He echoed immediately after Seong Jihan expressed his refusal.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though he was the team coach, Seong Jihan was a player beyond his authority, the coach had no right to order him around.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Blood and flesh, huh. Mecan… could they be colluding with the World Tree Alliance?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan speculated that the World Tree Alliance might be behind Mecan’s sudden demand for his blood, for there was no other reason the robotic civilization would make such a request otherwise.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If we can just stop their combination, Mecan appears somewhat manageable.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to his last life, the human representative team had definitely grown stronger.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks to the growth buffs created by Seong Jihan’s Daegi guild, the average level of the representative team was higher than before. Having acquired racial bonuses also proved to be quite helpful.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Plus, since I handle the ban card, the others avoid getting banned too, which is significant.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Humanity could always compete at full strength, excluding Seong Jihan, so it was natural that they were stronger than the representative team in his previous life.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, while they might not have dared to oppose Mecan in the past, the situation was different now.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s a pity only their recombination needed to be stopped. If only that was manageable, the human representative team could have secured victory even without me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  When humanity and the Mecans faced off, the first to be destroyed was the Mecans.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, even if the Mecan was broken, the robot parts were combined together to create a new robot, so humanity had no choice but to fall behind in terms of maintaining power.
 </p>
 <p>
  If they can just stop that, the humanity team can win without Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Humanity relies too much on me right now. That needs to be reduced.’
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan was pondering how the team could secure victories without him,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Might I be doing some activity?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swooosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  The face of the Shadow Queen emerged from Seong Jihan’s arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Activity?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Watching the second match, it seems my players might manage well if I bestow upon them shadow energy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can your shadow energy stop those robot combinations?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s possible to interfere.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, really? Then why didn’t you do it sooner?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You are humanity’s Constellation. Humans should always come first, so I needed permission.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan chuckled at the Shadow Queen’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, no need for permission. Feel free.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really? Then, may I engage in full Constellation activities?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. As long as it doesn’t harm humanity, I welcome it. But won’t using your power here delay your recovery?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It depends on the situation. This time, I’m only manifesting some shadow energy aspects, so the power I use is minimal. If my sponsored players become MVP, the fame points it generates would benefit me more.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Fame points?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sure. If a player I sponsor becomes MVP, the constellation gains fame points as a reward.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh… was there such a thing?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded, intrigued.
 </p>
 <p>
  The fact MVP achievements by sponsored players resulted in constellation fame rewards was news to him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘After all, if I don’t participate in games, we lose, and if I do, I invariably bag the MVP.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The option for constellation attributes had not been open for long.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, due to the team’s lack of skill, scenarios where a sponsored player could win the MVP did not arise.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, if the opponent wasn’t of Mecan’s caliber but belonged to the weakest line, perhaps humanity could now achieve victory without Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Since I’ve given the Shadow Queen a chance this time, let’s skip it and see how much comes in next time.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With that thought, Seong Jihan confirmed his decision to her.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I won’t intervene, go ahead.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really? Then I’ll support my sponsors.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoooosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, the figure of the Shadow Queen vanished.
 </p>
 <p>
  And progressing onto the third game.
 </p>
 <p>
  =This time, we’ve landed on the Southgate map we selected!
 </p>
 <p>
  =The ban situation looks good. The opponent’s ranks 1, 2, and 3 were all hit with bans!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah, it would have been perfect if Seong Jihan survived the ban. Too bad.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
 </p>
 <p>
  =Haha, if Seong Jihan had survived, it wouldn’t have mattered if their places 8, 9, and 10 were banned!
 </p>
 <p>
  Excluding Seong Jihan’s ban, humanity was bestowed with the best possible option.
 </p>
 <p>
  The familiar Southgate map was chosen, and luck bestowed bans on ranks 1, 2, and 3 out of the top 10.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why ban 1, 2, 3 here… should have used that luck on avoiding Seong Jihan’s ban honestly lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -Are those robot bastards going to combine again?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why are there so many roach-like tribes in BattleNet, both the World Tree Elves and the robots, they just don’t die _ _’
 </p>
 <p>
  -That seems to be the basic element to cruising in BattleNet… stubborn vitality.
 </p>
 <p>
  -If we lose this game, will we be offering blood and flesh tributes?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Nn, if we lose, we lose. We can’t hand over Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having seen the representative team’s limitations in the second game, viewers’ reactions were lukewarm.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  Without Seong Jihan, they assumed this game was also lost.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  =Oh… The Sword King. He’s charging at the forefront with a face full of venom!
 </p>
 <p>
  =That laser sword robot marking Yoon Sejin earlier is missing, huh! Must’ve been one of the ranks 1, 2, or 3.
 </p>
 <p>
  =The Sword King, effortlessly sweeping the vanguard with twin swords! Yes, this is what we wanted to see!
 </p>
 <p>
  Surprisingly, the early phase of the match saw humanity overpowering the opponent.
 </p>
 <p>
  The absence of the laser sword robot, which had focused on barraging the Sword King and later forced him on the defensive with its swordsmanship, played a significant part.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sword King, quickly subduing the robots guarding the gate, yelled at his warriors,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Destroy even the debris!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  At his command, players smashed down on the steel remains of robots.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the shattered parts proved surprisingly resilient, withstanding attacks from even the top-ranking human warriors.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Urgh….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why is it so hard?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Floating softly…
 </p>
 <p>
  The robotic debris began to rise again.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah, the robot remains are, after all, not breaking!
 </p>
 <p>
  =They are starting to stick together again. Are they trying to combine?
 </p>
 <p>
  =If the combined robots turn out stronger, that’s worrisome…!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the commentators were exclaiming over the rising debris,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swooosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  A shadow energy began to spread over some warriors’ weapons.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then suddenly, shadows clung onto the parts, following the components trying to unite and interfering.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Eh…
 </p>
 <p>
  =What is that?
 </p>
 <p>
  =Some players have black energy emitting from them!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah… These players. Checking the roster, they’re sponsored by the Constellation ‘Shadow Queen’!
 </p>
 <p>
  =The same constellation that acts as Seong Jihan player’s black sword?
 </p>
 <p>
  =Correct! After Seong Jihan player’s player sponsorship concluded, the Queen started her own sponsorship offers! She targeted mainly warriors, I heard…
 </p>
 <p>
  =Coincidentally, those using the black energy are all warriors sponsored by the Shadow Queen!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the commentators quickly caught the transformation,
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is our chance!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sword King, we’ll attack…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  With the interference of the shadows halting the recombination, the warriors shouted.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whirl!
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, twin swords flew.
 </p>
 <p>
  The swords obliterated the units attempting to combine.
 </p>
 <p>
  Smoldering…
 </p>
 <p>
  And once more, the fragments shattered and fell, unable to rise from the ground shadows.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Variable detected. Restoration impossible.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Variable detected. Restoration impossible.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The mechanical voices echoed a message of hope for the human representative team.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I too received a blessing from mom…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, who participated as an archer,
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike in the second game, was actively hindering the combination from a distance with the power of the void.
 </p>
 <p>
  Like that, robots, one after the other, rendered useless, fell.
 </p>

 </p>
 <p>
  [What is this suddenly. At this rate, my sponsors won’t be able to earn MVP…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching the game after exerting her strength, the Shadow Queen murmured.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The third game ends.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The human representative team wins.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The actual MVP of the game,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The third game MVP is Yoon Sejin.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Was the Sword King, Yoon Sejin.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  [A sponsored player ‘Yoon Se-jin’ has achieved MVP in the Space League.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You gain 500 Constellation Fame.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ooh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who had been merely watching the game, smiled as 500 Constellation Fame came in.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sword King, who had bounced back from the loss in the second game to shine brilliantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  He hadn’t expected him to be chosen as the MVP after witnessing his exploits.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sorry about that. The queen made the effort, but I’m reaping the benefit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan turned to the Shadow Queen who had been watching the game alongside him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…It’s okay. Even if not MVP, according to the performance in the Space League, Constellation Fame comes in its own way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really?”
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at his status screen upon hearing that.
 </p>
 <p>
  Excluding the 500 earned by the Sword King, thanks to the performances of top players like Masied,
 </p>
 <p>
  An additional 100 or so Constellation Fame had come in.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is quite rewarding, isn’t it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. However, this fame bonus applies only to victorious games in the Space League. If on a losing streak, it actually might diminish.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So I will lose fame if my player performs poorly?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. That’s why everyone sponsors only promising leaves.”
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s why constellations only sponsored the more successful races.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded and said,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I didn’t get any in the first game because I swept it all up?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. If you prioritize Constellation Fame, it’s better to drag the game and also concede MVP to other players.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That seems wise. MVP isn’t much use to me anymore.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Having already claimed all MVP rewards.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, Seong Jihan thought it best to step back and only intervene if humanity seemed on the brink of defeat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle! We finally won!!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Phew. Finally, we aren’t a burden….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “To win even without player Seong Jihan. When was the last time?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Exactly. It’s truly a moment to cherish…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Players who participated returned to the locker room with jubilant expressions.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, a few bore somber faces.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your Majesty!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re sorry. Despite your blessings, we couldn’t secure MVP…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Warriors who had received blessings from the Shadow Queen approached her as she watched from Seong Jihan’s side and kneeled.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Shadow Queen, motioning dismissively, reassured them.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s my shortcoming. Do better next time. I’m counting on you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ahh… Thank you for your gracious words.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes! We will work harder!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “To loyalty for the Queen!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Inspired by the queen’s words and pledging their loyalty, the players
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that settled? Don’t block the screen, step back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Yes, ma’am!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The queen received their loyalty with accustomed ease, issuing a decree to disperse.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jihan. Shall I also swear loyalty…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s not necessary.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m ready, just say the word.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Bringing MVP is the real loyalty.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Spurred by witnessing the loyalty oaths, Yoon Sejin and Masied threw in their comments.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan brushed these off lightly and focused on the start of the fourth game.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the coaching room on the screen,
 </p>
 <p>
  “League’s bottom ranks, excluding the number one… Where did all of Mecan’s proud data analysis go?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Coach Davis, seeing the unexpected victory, was smiling broadly.
 </p>
 <p>
  [To think humans sponsoring a constellation could interfere with our combination. Indeed, the constellations supporting humanity are more formidable than expected.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hohoho. So, are you still considering lifting the ban on Seong Jihan player for the fourth game in exchange for his blood and flesh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Will you provide it?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s say the answer depends on whether you lift the ban.”
 </p>
 <p>
  -Davis is on a roll lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -Here, lift the ban, and if they get stomped, isn’t it our win?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yup, 2 wins, 1 loss lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -These Mecan guys underestimated humanity, serves them right.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But banning ranks 1, 2, 3 was significant. Without the laser sword robot marking the Sword King, their front lines fell apart.
 </p>
 <p>
  -The ban luck did have an effect, after all.
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers, who were grumbling at the beginning about where the ban card luck landed,
 </p>
 <p>
  Were now completely reversing their stance, singing praises of Davis’ luck.
 </p>
 <p>
  Such was the advantageous position they now found themselves in.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Are you unwilling to provide the blood and flesh of the number one?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, who knows? Why don’t you deduce with your great data analysis!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It seems my data analysis excited you considerably.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Excited? I’m just happy about the match outcome.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you deliver the blood and flesh, not only victory, but we’ll also transfer Mecan technology to you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Technology?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Observe.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Bzzt…
 </p>
 <p>
  The Mecan coach displayed a hologram.
 </p>
 <p>
  And there, within a vast cylinder, a floating object was revealed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What is that? A brain?”
 </p>
 <p>
  On sight, it appeared very much like a human brain.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Davis furrowed his brow at the sight, the Mecan coach responded,
 </p>
 <p>
  [We Mecan represent the future of humanity. We offer you advanced brain preservation technology.]

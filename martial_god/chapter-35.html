   Chapter 35
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  – The subscriber count…???
 </p>
 <p>
  – Not the 1st place condition???
 </p>
 <p>
  “Condition of being the top remain unchanged.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Someone who was betting 30 billion just to see his status window.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the Neo Self-Defense Force seems the most likely suspect, there’s no conclusive evidence.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, retaliating directly against an anonymous opponent is difficult.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Increasing the conditions to show my status window to an absurd level is perhaps the best revenge I can do.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, the best way would be to cancel the promise to reveal the status window altogether.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But doing so would drastically reduce interest in my broadcast.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite being a Bronze League channel, Seong Jihan’s channel was rapidly gaining popularity day by day.
 </p>
 <p>
  Several factors contributed to this rapid growth.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the biggest of them all was the curiosity about Seong Jihan’s status window and the anticipation of when it would be revealed.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he were to cancel the promise now, he would lose most of the viewers.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Neo Self-Defense Force should serve as the spark for my broadcast.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Though it’s not yet confirmed if the Neo Self-Defense Force is behind the 30 billion mission to see his status window, he had to subtly suggest that they might be involved during the broadcast.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This will help me gain more attention.’
 </p>
 <p>
  After the Sword King moved to Japan, the current anti-Japanese sentiment, the strongest in the 21st century, just hinting that the Neo Self-Defense Force is after him would garner significant attention.
 </p>
 <p>
  Given the current rate of subscribers, reaching 200,000 will be quick. I needed an excuse to make a change. This worked out well.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Jihan, using Takeda’s scheme to his advantage, smirked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you want to see my status window that badly… either stop me from getting the first rank or gather a million subscribers.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  With a wave of his hand, the three Black Eagle guild members floated up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Inventory.”
 </p>
 <p>
  While keeping them in the air, he opened his inventory and took out an item.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a long rope, an F-grade item called the ‘Binding Rope.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Binding Rope shot out from Jihan’s hand like a snake, binding the three in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Why does he even have a rope lol
 </p>
 <p>
  – Was he prepared for this?
 </p>
 <p>
  – He throws it like an artist. Was he a cowboy in his past life?
 </p>
 <p>
  In an instant, the three players were tightly bound without even a chance to resist.
 </p>
 <p>
  After confirming that their bodies were completely restrained, Seong Jihan released Force.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Squelch!
 </p>
 <p>
  He began dragging the three bound party members.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Look at them being humiliated lol
 </p>
 <p>
  – Did they just become a joke? Lol, pathetic
 </p>
 <p>
  – Black Eagle Guild? More like Black Joke Guild lol
 </p>
 <p>
  The warrior gritted his teeth in humiliation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Being a part of the Gangnam 1st Division, he was once treated as a promising individual wherever he went.
 </p>
 <p>
  But now, he was being paraded in front of everyone in the most humiliating manner.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Se-Seong Jihan…! How dare you! Treating us like this? Are you looking down on the Black Eagle Guild?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  He tried to threaten Jihan by mentioning his guild, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  Chuckle!
 </p>
 <p>
  He was met with not only Jihan’s laugh but also…
 </p>
 <p>
  – A Bronze Rank player threatening with a guild?
 </p>
 <p>
  – You can tell he’s a third-rate villain lol
 </p>
 <p>
  – Villain? More like a joke lol lol lol
 </p>
 <p>
  The scorn from the viewers.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Ughhhh…’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan continued to drag them with a mocking smile, the Warrior desperately thought.
 </p>

 <p>
  ‘Last time… the Mage who badmouthed his niece ended up dead…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Mage, Kim Gyuhyuk, who was brutally beaten by Jihan after badmouthing his nephew.
 </p>
 <p>
  When he had watched it, he had thought what a trashy person the Mage was.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But now I have to die, even if it means being trash.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Bound all over and with only his mouth free.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, with his entire body bound and only his mouth free, he wanted to provoke Jihan into killing him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your nie-… mmmph…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  But as soon as he tried to say ‘Niece’, the warrior’s mouth was forcibly shut.
 </p>
 <p>
  His words were blocked by the force.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stay quiet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, using Acupoint Sealing, shut the warrior’s mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Now I can pick up the pace.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who shut all three of them using the Acupoint Sealing, took the Warrior’s weapon and began moving forward in earnest.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do not disturb his-.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  Before the sentence could be finished, a shield flew like a gust of wind, smashing into the head of a guard.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the warrior’s shield, now in Jihan’s hands, serving as an impressive offensive weapon rather than a defensive one.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  As Jihan marched relentlessly, traps sprung from all sides and arrows flew towards him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang! Clang!
 </p>
 <p>
  Jihan deflected the incoming arrows with the shield, “I need to be careful.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He kindly halted the arrows heading towards his party members using Force.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Heal.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He even provided healing services for his party members who got hurt while being dragged.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  Jihan was the epitome of a perfect Support.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Look at him taking care of his party members!
 </p>
 <p>
  – I thought the Mage would die soon, but I don’t think that’s happening anymore.
 </p>
 <p>
  – If they die, they get 10 billion, what a pity lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moving faster than when he teamed up with the party, Jihan soon arrived at the last room of the dungeon’s 6th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  [Surround the intruder.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do not let a single one live.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as Jihan entered the last room of the dungeon, the guards of the mausoleum were summoned from all sides.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike before, where they only appeared in front, now they were coming from all directions, forming a tight encirclement.
 </p>
 <p>
  This encirclement was the biggest challenge in conquering the dungeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  Breaking through the encirclement of the guards without losing a single member was the actual final mission of the dungeon ‘Conqueror’s Mausoleum’.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Can Jihan protect his party members in this room? There are over 100 guards.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Carrying them around like that, someone might get hit.
 </p>
 <p>
  – This is the biggest challenge.
 </p>
 <p>
  – My chicken has arrived!!!!!!
 </p>
 <p>
  Even the viewers, familiar with Jihan’s abilities, were uncertain.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because with over a hundred powerful guards shooting arrows from all sides, one unlucky arrow could kill a party member.
 </p>
 <p>

 <p>
  [Proofreader – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  Typical strategy guides recommended staying closely packed and pushing through to the passage leading to the 7th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, Jihan had no such intentions.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Limited Quest]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Annihilate the guards.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Reward: 1,000 Achievement Points.]
 </p>
 <p>
  This limited quest only appeared once Jihan reached the 6th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  A smile formed on Jihan’s lips.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s about time. I haven’t received a big quest in a while.’
 </p>
 <p>
  After a long absence of achievement quests, getting 1,000 achievement points was a welcome reward.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shield.”
 </p>

 <p>
  Jihan dragged his party members to the center and cast the basic support magic, ‘Shield’.
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers were in awe as a massive protective barrier formed.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was an unusually thick shield for a basic spell.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Why is that shield so thick?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ah… So this is Jihan’s ‘Shield’…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Is there anything he can’t do?!
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks to Force, the combined power of Mana and Divine Power, the shield was fortified.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Still, it’s a basic spell. It won’t hold for long.’
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how fortified the shield was with Force, it would eventually break under the concentrated attack of the guards.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the short time he had bought, he had to suppress the enemies.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Jihan’s figure vanished in an instant, rushing to where the guards were gathered.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Death to those who disturb his rest!]
 </p>
 <p>
  To block Jihan, the front-line guards swiftly raised their shields, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Move aside.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  With a simple gesture from Seong Jihan, the hands of the guards simultaneously exploded, rendering them powerless in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  With his Force reaching level 20, his ‘Absolute Domain’ had expanded. Within this domain, the possibilities of what Jihan could do were limitless.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  He exploded the hands holding the weapons and evaded the slowed attacks within his domain, easily cutting down his enemies.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Death…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Slash!
 </p>
 <p>
  The guards, speaking so slowly, couldn’t even finish their sentences before they were sent sprawling on the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The potential of Force is endless.’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘To think Barren used such a remarkable ability as just “a more powerful Magic Power”.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Jihan, amidst the guards moving as if in slow motion, effortlessly cut them down, dismantling their encirclement.
 </p>
 <p>
  In no time at all,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Kill… Intruder…]
 </p>
 <p>
  The last guard exploded.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have cleared the Limited Quest.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have gained 1,000 Achievement Points as a reward.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shall we continue?”
 </p>
 <p>
  After completing the quest and deactivating his shield, Jihan began to drag his party members along again.
 </p>
 <p>
  His nonchalant tone made it sound as if he was simply taking a stroll with a puppy.
 </p>
 <p>
  – The guards exploded like they were made of glass. Weren’t they supposed to be tough?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Nothing works against him.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Seriously, what kind of insane ability does he have?
 </p>
 <p>
  Not just the Scouts, but regular viewers were also curious about Jihan’s stats.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Isn’t the subscriber requirement too high all of a sudden?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Thanks to Takeda trolling, the reveal is now delayed.
 </p>
 <p>
  – 1 million… lol, 200,000 seemed achievable soon, but a million? lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  – With 30 billion, why not just hire fake subscribers? Why flip the table?
 </p>
 <p>
  – It’s difficult given the BattleNet system, isn’t it?
 </p>
 <p>
  BattleNet, created using advanced extraterrestrial technology, made it nearly impossible to manipulate figures.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although one could create multiple accounts, the system was stringent when it came to GP (game points) transactions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Manipulating subscribers or views was virtually impossible in this foolproof system.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om
 </p>
 <p>
  – But surely, before reaching 1 million, he’ll lose the first rank, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Seriously, 1 million is over the line. How many BattleTubers in our country even have a million subscribers?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Only Diamond Leaguer players, maybe?
 </p>
 <p>
  Just like when he initially set 200,000 subscribers as the condition, everyone unanimously believed that revealing the stats due to a failure in securing the first rank would happen before reaching 1 million subscribers. Because 1 million was such an unimaginable number.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Nonsense! There’s no way Mr. Seong Jihan’s first rank record will break. He’ll reach 1 million subscribers first!
 </p>
 <p>
  – It’s Streamer Golden Light!
 </p>
 <p>
  – A black sheep worth 10 million!
 </p>
 <p>
  Only Streamer Golden Light, who revealed the existence of the 10 billion won mission to Jihan, confidently chatted that reaching 1 million subscribers would come before any failure in maintaining the first rank.
 </p>
 <p>
  – But… the Conqueror’s Statue won’t be easy right?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Yeah, it requires cooperation with party members.
 </p>
 <p>
  – After being dragged around like dogs? If he lets them go, they might just kill themselves out of shame.
 </p>
 <p>
  Others subtly hoped that Jihan might slip from his first rank, all eyes now on the final mission of the 7th floor.

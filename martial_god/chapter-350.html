  Chapter 350

 <p>
  Chapter 350
 </p>
 <p>
  “Brain preservation technology…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [We Mecans also started at a similar point as humanity.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Zziiing…
 </p>
 <p>
  A new hologram displayed a scene, revealing a race that resembled humanity but looked a bit more apelike.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ranked lowest in BattleNet evaluations. Our starting point was being at the bottom ranks, eventually disappearing… We possessed abilities similar to those of current humanity.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Similar to us?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. A race insufficient to overcome BattleNet. To transcend the limits of our species, we chose a special method. Instead of frail flesh, we replaced our bodies with steel.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The screen rapidly showed how the apelike race transformed into robots.
 </p>
 <p>
  Brains were extracted and placed inside special solutions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bipedal robots were then shown connected to each brain with yellow lines.
 </p>
 <p>
  As scenes of transcending science and super-science appeared on the screen,
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is that ape race Australopithecus or what?
 </p>
 <p>
  -They do seem to have specs similar to humans, huh.
 </p>
 <p>
  -So, you gotta extract your brain to become a robot, huh?
 </p>
 <p>
  -A race that actually realizes brains in jars…
 </p>
 <p>
  [PR/N: Australopithecus is a species that lived in Africa between 4.18 and 2 million years ago. The name “Australopithecus” means “southern ape” and was originally used for a species found in South Africa.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers expressed disgust upon seeing brains floating out of heads.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The brains can be maintained for at least a thousand years. If humanity were to receive this technology, you could easily surpass your species’ lifespan.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even if you surpass the lifespan, if it’s just the brain remaining…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Mecan coach conveyed that humanity could transcend their lifespan,
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have the blood and flesh of your number one, don’t you?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Why bring him into this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [He has already far surpassed the limits. By cloning his body and transplanting brains into it, all of humanity could live for a thousand years. We will also specially transmit that technology to you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Mecans revealed why they were so persistent in requesting Seong Jihan’s blood and flesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow, they were really thinking of cloning him, huh _ _;
 </p>
 <p>
  -Thought they were planning tributes for the World Tree Elves…
 </p>
 <p>
  -But just saying it like that, who knows what they’d actually use it for, honestly.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Seong Jihan’s body will live for a thousand years?
 </p>
 <p>
  -So, everyone swapping into Seong Jihan’s bodies… might not be too bad?
 </p>
 <p>
  -With Seong Jihan, we’re in the upper ranks, why clone him? Just get lost lol
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers did not take Mecan’s proposal to share Seong Jihan’s body seriously.
 </p>
 <p>
  And Coach Davis immediately rejected the offer.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s why you’ve been asking for his flesh up to now? Insane…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [An instant way to advance your race by several stages. We will await your wise decision.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Enough. But… Mecan, wasn’t this your first time in BattleNet?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It is not our first time.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Flick!
 </p>
 <p>
  The hologram turned off.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seemingly uninterested in discussing the topic further, the Mecan coach halted the conversation.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wasn’t it supposed to be a league for newcomers? Why so many experienced players _ _;
 </p>
 <p>
  -Then don’t call it the Bronze League, seriously lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why is humanity even in this place?
 </p>
 <p>
  -What if we’ve already participated once before? lolol
 </p>
 <p>
  -Did ancient civilizations participate or what, damn.
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers became agitated upon learning that Mecan, like the World Tree Elves, was also experienced in BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet,
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Mecan’ decides to ban humanity’s number 2.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Player ‘Oliver’ has been banned. He cannot participate in the next game.]
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh, lolol
 </p>
 <p>
  -Guaranteed win for game 4, let’s goYôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  -The coach kept his word, at least!
 </p>
 <p>
  -Trust in robots, they have integrity unlike humans, haha
 </p>
 <p>
  With the Mecan’s ban targeting Oliver instead of Seong Jihan, the viewers quickly embraced it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s game over now that Uncle’s taking part. But why did they unban him?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Maybe they thought we’d accept their proposal? Quite naive for all that data analysis they did.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They probably saw it as a good offer from their perspective.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan quietly watched Oliver getting banned, he pondered Mecan’s intentions of swapping out their mechanical bodies for his.
 </p>
 <p>
  They presented the proposal as if it truly were an attractive deal for humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, some people in humanity might actually like it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  After all, Seong Jihan’s body, as Mecan claimed, could live for a thousand years.
 </p>
 <p>
  There wouldn’t be a lack of those coveting it.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he wasn’t the unparalleled existence on Earth that he is now,
 </p>
 <p>
  People might discreetly agree to Mecan’s proposal out of the public eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Clones of Jihan… Mecan’s intentions are too transparent. Did they think we’d agree just because they talked about it like that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, they just threw it out there to see. But it’s good they lifted the ban for the 4th game.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Ah, if I’m to live with Jihan, I should probably start taking care of my health too. Living a thousand years…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I wonder if I’d want to live that long.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan smiled wryly at Sophia, who looked up at him.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Wandering Martial God, and even the Taiji’s Lost Soul, the Abyss owner.
 </p>
 <p>
  With major obstacles both outside in space and on Earth, living another five years, let alone a thousand, was uncertain.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But if brother-in-law becomes the MVP in the 4th game, then he’s the series MVP, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It should be, since he won the MVP in game 2.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, I’ll give him a push this time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Me? Nah, Jihan should take it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin waved it off as if it was absurd,
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, it’s also advantageous for me. I’ll stick to support.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, recalling the Constellation Fame rewards, decided to take a step back in game 4.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  =This map is ‘Wrecked Spaceship.’
 </p>
 <p>
  =The game type is Survival, with only 20 members from each team participating on this relatively small map.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Given the map’s size, it’s advantageous for us, having Seong Jihan on our team.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Indeed. The map was selected by the Mecan race, making one wonder why they’d choose such a map.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Releasing Seong Jihan and choosing a survival map… Maybe they gave up on the game?
 </p>
 <p>
  From the moment Seong Jihan survived the ban, the commentators’ voices lacked tension.
 </p>
 <p>
  Leading the series 2-1, humanity had the advantage.
 </p>
 <p>
  If Seong Jihan could put a period on the series, victory in this Space League was assured.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Game 4 begins!
 </p>
 <p>
  And the game started.
 </p>
 <p>
  Within a space on the wrecked spaceship,
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin, who drew his twin swords, looked at Seong Jihan, who had his arms crossed behind his back.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really… I’m going for the MVP?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, go ahead. I’ll support you from behind.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Alright then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Taking the lead as per Seong Jihan’s instructions, Yoon Sejin approached the door inside the spaceship.
 </p>
 <p>
  Creeeak.
 </p>
 <p>
  The door automatically opened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “After you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin took the lead, followed by the rest of humanity’s players.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the small map of the Space League game,
 </p>
 <p>
  Creeeak. Creeeak.
 </p>
 <p>
  the automatic doors opened endlessly, and humanity’s players had already passed the tenth space.
 </p>
 <p>
  “When are these guys coming out?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right. The map isn’t that big, is it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as humanity’s players were getting nervous over the absent enemy,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whirr. Whirr!
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, the room they entered sounded an alarm.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What, what’s that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Before the players could even react,
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom! Boom! Boom! Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  The walls of the entered space exploded and giant rocks burst through.
 </p>
 <p>
  Along with that, flashes of electric current from all sides.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Arghhh…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A few players were electrocuted, tremors running through their bodies but,
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s enough.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan extended his hand, and the flashing currents from all sides gathered into his palm.
 </p>
 <p>
  The giant rock that seemed to be tearing open the spaceship also stopped moving.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Phew… We’re safe.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you, Mr. Seong Jihan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded at the players’ gratitude but wrinkled his brow slightly.
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I shouldn’t be standing out.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Game 4 was supposed to highlight Yoon Sejin so he could nab the MVP.
 </p>
 <p>
  If situations requiring his intervention kept arising, then the MVP would naturally drift away from Yoon Sejin.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Be more cautious going forward.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan reminded the players to be more careful so he wouldn’t need to intervene, but
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  The game did not flow as he intended.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah, the spaceship explodes again!
 </p>
 <p>
  =What is with this spaceship! Every time we move to a new room, it collapses!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Seong Jihan player has dominated the space again, stopping the meteor!
 </p>
 <p>
  =He also stopped the flames spreading from the previous room, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  =Taking the rearmost place to protect all team members!
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

 </div>
 <p>
  ‘Ah, seriously.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Enemies were nowhere to be seen and the spaceship continually collapsed whenever a door was opened.
 </p>
 <p>
  If not for Seong Jihan, half of the 20 could’ve been gone due to the intense pressure of the space.
 </p>
 <p>
  This might just end up with Seong Jihan being the MVP again.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Why won’t Mecan show up?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Having saved too many, Seong Jihan now hoped for the enemy to appear quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  After moving forward a few more times,
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I wonder what will come out this time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This spaceship is the strangest thing. Every space we’ve been through has collapsed, but as soon as we cross the door, it’s fine.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now it’ll collapse again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “And then Player Seong will save us again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The players, now used to the explosion pattern of rooms,
 </p>
 <p>
  Creeeak.
 </p>
 <p>
  Entered the opened automatic door with weary expressions.
 </p>
 <p>
  And while the man who had saved most, Seong Jihan, was about to step forward with crossed arms behind his back,
 </p>
 <p>
  Clank! Clank!
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, the automatic door folded instantly under immense pressure, and even the space beyond began collapsing.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What’s this.’
 </p>
 <p>
  At this rate, those in the room would be crushed to death.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan quickly tried to open that space using the spatial domination of Martial Soul, but
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  A flash of light, and the space beyond disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  The passageway of the spaceship was cut off midway.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hweeiiii…
 </p>
 <p>
  Where the space had been, there was only swirling sand from the planet where the spaceship had landed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…No.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He planned to stay back and only support in this game, but in an instant, 19 members of his team disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Player ‘Yoon Sejin’ has died.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Player ‘Barren’ has died.]
 </p>
 <p>
  …
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite him making way for them to aim for the MVP, was the outcome going to be a total team wipe?
 </p>
 <p>
  Staring blankly at the death messages rolling in, Seong Jihan saw,
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang. Clang.
 </p>
 <p>
  Beyond the disappeared space, the wreckage of the colossal spaceship landed on the sandy planet.
 </p>
 <p>
  Slowly started merging and moving.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Wow, the spaceship is disassembling and assembling together…!
 </p>
 <p>
  =We’ve seen this scene before…
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah, the spaceship. It’s transforming into a giant robot!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Could this possibly be Mecan…?
 </p>
 <p>
  In games 1-3, Mecan appeared as manageable bipedal robots for humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  But in this game, they transformed into a gigantic robot through some means.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Are you kidding me, an entire spaceship and map background merge to form that? lolol
 </p>
 <p>
  -Doesn’t humanity have something like that to utilize in a map? Ridiculously unfair _ _;
 </p>
 <p>
  -If we had that, we wouldn’t be the lowest-ranked race…
 </p>
 <p>
  -At least, how come only Seong Jihan survived being at the back
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers were bewildered by the sight of a giant robot formed by the merging of the wrecked spaceship with Mecans, their only consolation being Seong Jihan’s survival.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile,
 </p>
 <p>
  Zziiing.
 </p>
 <p>
  The bipedal robot’s eyes glowed red, and a voice emanated from it.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Rank 1 player. Why did you not advance?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why, were you trying to get my blood and flesh data in that previous space?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. We prepared a lot for it, but caught only the useless ones.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Fluurr…
 </p>
 <p>
  And with that, flames burst forth from the giant robot’s chest.
 </p>
 <p>
  The power of the flames surged intensely.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, upon seeing it, twitched his eyebrows.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Is that the power of the sun?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Having absorbed the Little Sun’s power, Seong Jihan could better discern the nature of flame energy.
 </p>
 <p>
  And Mecan, which had shown no association with fire until now,
 </p>
 <p>
  In this 4th game, they revealed their true strength by strongly absorbing solar energy.
 </p>
 <p>
  [We will move to the next phase to overpower you with strength.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “With the power of the sun?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [……]
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon mentioning the sun, Mecan didn’t reply but only continued to burn intensely.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing this, Seong Jihan was reminded of the Little Sun’s power he had faced before.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Could it be that Mecan has ties with the Sun King…?’
 </p>
 <p>
  While Dragon Thunder would be fine since its power resembled that of dragons, using the Destruction Code would be a mistake.
 </p>
 <p>
  Keeping that in mind, Seong Jihan took out the half-mask from his inventory.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no need to activate the Constellation traits, but amplification of the Void was necessary against this level of enemy.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Since Constellation Fame is out of the window, might as well make ’em cough up items.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Soooosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  A strong Void aura emanated from Seong Jihan’s body.

 <p>
  Chapter 351
 </p>
 <p>
  They transformed into a giant robot after fusing with the destroyed spaceship,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Mecan race posed a challenge.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, for Seong Jihan, this opponent was not difficult to deal with.
 </p>
 <p>
  The mere thrust of the Blood’s Clan Spear would have shattered the robot instantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, Seong Jihan deliberately chose not to draw it, instead, he utilized the half-mask.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Considering they might be connected to the Sun King, it’s better to play it safe.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Following the traces of the Red administrator, the Sun King could be related to this foe.
 </p>
 <p>
  Against such an enemy, it was best to use as little of one’s statutory power as possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Amplifying the Void, Seong Jihan bolstered Eclipse.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fundamental Divine Arts,
 </p>
 <p>
  Dark Shadow Technique:
 </p>
 <p>
  Shadow Divine Blade
 </p>
 <p>
  In an instant, the sword that soared into the sky cleaved the giant robot in half.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
 </p>
 <p>
  Mecan, swiftly overtaken by the dark sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Attempts to dispel the shadows with blazing light were made, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  Shoooo…
 </p>
 <p>
  The flames that pierced through the shadows flickered a few times before being engulfed by darkness and extinguished.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Seong Jihan, with a single strike, subjugates the Mecan fused with the spaceship!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Given the enemy utilized the map’s structures, they seemed formidable… yet, they stood no chance against Seong Jihan!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Mecan… despite their desire to acquire his blood and flesh, couldn’t even touch a hair on Seong Jihan’s head!
 </p>
 <p>
  When all 19 human representatives were defeated, and a towering robot emerged, everyone feared a difficult challenge.
 </p>
 <p>
  But then, Seong Jihan, masked and wielding a single dagger, delivered a decisive blow, swiftly conquering the formidable opponent.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Seong Ji-han is on another level now!
 </p>
 <p>
  -The Mecan seemed to have an absolute advantage, yet Seong Jihan ended it in one strike…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Well, Seong Jihan was the one flying around on the elf-favorable map, so what’s a robot’s advantage, lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -True, those guys are weaker than the elves, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Still, I was a bit worried seeing that robot’s size, haha
 </p>
 <p>
  -It seems the Mecan team put their faith in that thing and let Seong Jihan play all four matches, but he’s just too much for them…
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan donned the mask and consumed the mighty foe with a single blow, onlookers who were initially tense seeing Mecan’s fusion form awaited comfortably for the result of the fourth game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, the game that seemed to conclude in a blink of an eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I was nearly breached there.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, unsatisfied, observed the Shadow Divine Blade closely.
 </p>
 <p>
  The giant robot, seemingly trapped in darkness, tried from within to emanate the energy of the sun.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though it ceased its resistance and was consumed by the shadows, had it not been for the half-mask amplifying the Void, the Shadow Divine Blade would have been neutralized by the light.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You are skilled at mixing void with the Shadow Sword, amplifying its power… Indeed, an enviable ability. However, there’s room for improvement in utilizing the shadows.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Shadow Queen herself, experiencing the Shadow Divine Blade within Eclipse, admired the use of the Void but gave a cold comment on the shadow-powered Shadow Divine Blade.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I might have neglected the Dark Shadow Techniques. Certainly, there seems to be room for further development.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the Fundamental Divine Arts, the Dark Shadow Technique forms one axis.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the other axis, the Crimson Thunder evolved into Dragon Thunder, reaching even statutory levels, the development of the Dark Shadow Technique had been stagnant.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I thought mixing in the energy of life would yield some result, but there hasn’t been any noticeable progress…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Eclipse, renamed to Shadow of Life, had the potential according to BattleNet descriptions to reach an EX-grade power level depending on how its strength was wielded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, it barely manifested the power of an SSS-grade.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There must have been a reason why the Martial God chose the Dark Shadow Technique after the Dragon Thunder.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Having somewhat advanced the statutory aspect, it was time to delve into the lagging shadow power.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought this while inspecting the Mecan, completely overtaken by the Shadow Divine Blade,
 </p>
 <p>
  Emitting an ominous solar power, it seemed connected to the Sun King.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the robot, now just a heap of scrap metal consumed by shadows, offered little to salvage.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Void increases by 1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No loot, just a void increase.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan clicked his tongue, removing the mask.
 </p>
 <p>
  Consequently, the power of the Shadow Divine Blade visibly weakened.
 </p>
 <p>
  The shadows that enveloped the giant robot and blocked out the sunlight had reduced by more than half.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, gradually, the world was bathed in light.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Isn’t the game over yet?’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan pondered this,
 </p>
 <p>
  Twitch.
 </p>

 <p>
  Movement was observed within the debris of the destroyed robot on the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  Reacting to the sunlight, the remains started to regenerate slowly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Tenacious.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as Seong Jihan prepared to destroy the debris,
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzzing…
 </p>
 <p>
  [Opponent’s power, determined as void]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Target player, removed from concern list]
 </p>
 <p>
  Flaring…
 </p>
 <p>
  Similar to when Seong Jihan coded, letters recognizable only by him appeared above the debris. With the disappearing letters, the debris shattered, revealing a sparkling object.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What’s that?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan levitated the item into his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You acquire ‘Destroyed Solar Terminal’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Following the message, Seong Jihan attempted to examine the item closely, but
 </p>
 <p>
  [Game 4 concludes.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The human representative team wins.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The opponent was declared dead, and the game ended before he could further investigate.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  [Humanity’s rank 1, an absurd existence.]
 </p>
 <p>
  After Game 4,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Mecan coach briefly assessed the match.
 </p>
 <p>
  [However, we will retract our previous proposal.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You mean the one about trading blood and flesh for cloning technology?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Correct. His exhibition of power beyond normal standards is due to the void which means he doesn’t possess the physical form we seek.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well… suit yourself.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As if it mattered, and given that Seong Jihan wouldn’t have agreed anyway, Davis merely nodded dismissively.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Nonetheless, there’s some research value in it, so if you provide us with blood and flesh later, we can concede 1 victory.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You don’t have to. We’ll win either way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As both coaches exchanged words,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, witnessing the scene, thought to himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  ’Having nullified them with the void, their interest in me has vanished.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Were these beings truly pawns of the Sun King?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan revisited the item he had obtained a moment ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Destroyed Solar Terminal]
 </p>
 <p>
  -Grade: F
 </p>
 <p>
  -After use, this terminal has exhausted all of the sun’s power and cannot be recharged, rendering it useless.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  The once sparkling Solar Terminal had now turned into a dull, yellow rock. According to BattleNet, it appeared utterly worthless.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘To obtain such a worthless item.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Toss it?
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan debated, the Constellation of the Dead Star came to mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Now that I think about it, he hated the Sun King.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Constellation of the Dead Star, branded a slave by the Sun King.
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering the item was useless anyway, why not give it to him?
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the Dead Star’s habit of pretending to be smart, weighing the pros and cons, he had been quite helpful to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Deciding so, Seong Jihan sent a message him.
 </p>
 <p>
  – I’ve obtained a ‘Destroyed Solar Terminal’ from my recent encounter. Would you find it useful?
 </p>
 <p>
  Promptly, a message replied within less than a second.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The ‘Constellation of the Dead Star’ sends an urgent message.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [He asks where you found the Solar Terminal and requests a 1:1 conversation.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Accepting the request, a translucent head appeared before Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Head! A Solar Terminal, how did you come to possess it?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I acquired it from Mecan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mecan? Who are they again? Ah… wait, those beings that linger in the Bronze League. Did you record it on BattleTube? You did, I’ll review the footage.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Merely at the mention of Mecan, the Constellation of the Dead Star quickly shifted gears to analyze data.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, with its head eyes shining a blue light,
 </p>
 <p>
  Tick. Tick.
 </p>
 <p>
  “These rascals… They even aimed for your flesh and blood? Trying to clone my head, they’ve crossed the line.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Hearing about the plan to clone Seong Jihan, he expressed outrage for meddling with “his head.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ve already gone through the footage?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yep. Skimmed at 1000x speed. Hm, using the sun’s power alone doesn’t confirm a connection to the Sun King but the Solar Terminal… This is another story.”

 <p>
  With that, Karlein opened its mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  A tiny black whirlpool formed inside the once translucent head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Would you mind throwing that terminal here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s in it for me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hoho… If it’s a real Solar Terminal, it’s only right I compensate you!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan tossed the terminal into the whirlpool.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow, it really is a Solar Terminal… To think these mechanical civilizations were underlings of the Sun King. Unexpected.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Glint.
 </p>
 <p>
  A red glow flickered in Karlein’s skeletal eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “For this incident, I’ll… launch an attack on Mecan’s planet and transmit it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Attack their planet?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, hehe. Having discovered a pawn of the Sun King, it’s only logical to flip them over. The terminal will also reveal Mecan’s coordinates… all conditions are met.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Was it really okay for a constellation to attack just based on a piece of evidence?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan briefly entertained the thought but,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, it’s beneficial for us.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Mecan was both a competitor in the Bronze League and possibly backed by the formidable Sun King.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the Constellation of the Dead Star attacked them, it would be advantageous for his side.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, finish your attack and let me know.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it. I’ll give them a good thrashing~!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoooosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  With those final words, the head vanished in haste.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Just keeping Mecan in check is reward enough.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought as he watched himself being named the series MVP on screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike when Yoon Sejin won MVP in the third game, being named MVP added absolutely nothing to the reputation of his constellation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’m definitely not getting MVP next time.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He sternly resolved, looking at the unchanging system message screen.
 </p>
 <p>

 <p>
  [VIP Member Seong Jihan, Humanity’s Sturdy Support.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The future of humanity as shown by Mecan with only the brain remaining.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [With Seong Jihan’s power, the concept of void brought to light by Mecan’s coach. What is the Void?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Constellation Shadow Queen makes her presence known.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [A housekeeper claiming to have worked in the penthouse, caught by police for attempting to sell a lock of Seong Jihan’s hair for 50 million Won.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [PR/N: Reminds me of that one ugly-handsome dude fighting manhwa stalker incident.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The match against Mecan concluded with a final score of 3:1 in humanity’s favor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the score board suggested a total victory for humanity, the actual gameplay underscored humanity’s heavy reliance on Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  -We relied on Seong Jihan again this time.
 </p>
 <p>
  -This time? It’s eternal, hahaha.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Exactly, verified bus driver, keep driving us, hahaha.
 </p>
 <p>
  -What’s with this housekeeper scam though, LOL. Was there really a buyer for the hair?
 </p>
 <p>
  -But if it’s genuine, BattleNet labs might even buy it for 50 million…
 </p>
 <p>
  “The person arrested, turns out it wasn’t who had visited us in the past.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah opened the conversation while reading the article about the 50 million Won hair.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. I called just in case. The person in the article was just a scammer. But… there are some poking around our trash.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Um… to check if uncle’s saliva is on it, perhaps?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh, people are something.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  Due to Mecan, he’d unwittingly become a walking lottery.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Wish Karlein would teach them a lesson soon.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was glad he had passed on the rock to that guy, a message arrived.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Thanks to you, I could smash the Sun King’s pawn. I’m truly grateful once more.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Already?
 </p>
 <p>
  It hadn’t been long since he handed over the terminal, and it was already smashed.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan found Karlein’s message astonishing,
 </p>
 <p>
  [So, I’ve prepared a modest counter-gift for you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Oh?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Intrigued by the talk of an item, he shifted his attention.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Would you like to receive a special reward from the Constellation of the Dead Star?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Let’s see what it is.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan pressed yes.

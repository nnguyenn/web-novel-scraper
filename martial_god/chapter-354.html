  Chapter 354

 <p>
  Chapter 354
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If Pythia hadn’t pinpointed it, I would have completely missed it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The life force felt under the North Sea was extremely faint.
 </p>
 <p>
  Had Pythia not specified its location, it was subtle enough to go unnoticed.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, once detected, the life force emanating from there began to intensify gradually.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We need to look below.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, I’ll apply a barrier.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Pythia moved her hand, a large protective barrier enveloped her and Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Venturing beneath the sea.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The deeper we go, the stronger the life force feels.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan surveyed his surroundings as he descended to the seabed.
 </p>
 <p>
  And moving towards the area with the strongest life force, what he found was.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods.…’
 </p>
 <p>
  A representation of the Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods, no larger than the palm of a hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though it was the smallest rendition of the Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods Seong Jihan had encountered, its completeness was beyond anything he could dare replicate.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The degree of perfection is overwhelming just from looking at this formation.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Merely observing the formation had Seong Jihan feeling overwhelmed.
 </p>
 <p>
  What exactly was sealed within such a flawless sealing formation?
 </p>
 <p>
  And even with such a powerful seal, how could life force still seep through it?
 </p>
 <p>
  He quietly observed the symbol of the Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods before speaking to Pythia.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You mentioned earlier about visiting the place where the Martial God and Dongbang Sak met, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That was mentioned, yes…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this really the place?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s….”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia scanned around.
 </p>
 <p>
  The world beyond the barrier was in the middle of the seabed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fish were visible above them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Could the Martial God and Dongbang Sak have met in such a place?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, it seems unlikely their first meeting was here….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Still, seeing the Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods drawn on the seafloor, it suggests there’s definitely something significant here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I mentioned earlier that the souls of the giants had regenerated, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. You mentioned Dongbang Sak ventured around to seal them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. The souls of the giants scattered around the world… Perhaps this sealing formation is related to that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red tribe and the Great golems, who had fused with the World Tree and acquired the ability to regenerate even in soul form.
 </p>
 <p>
  The intricate Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods drawn on the ocean floor possibly sealing them was a plausible theory.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The souls of giants… It seems there’s more than just that here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods is a perfect seal. If life force can escape through it, it implies there’s a potent essence of life inside. But, would the souls of giants, even partially merged with the World Tree, emit such precise life force?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The power of life felt even above the sea, breaking through the Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed improbable for the souls of giants to exhibit such presence, even having merged with the World Tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah… Unless it was the World Tree itself.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…The World Tree?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The World Tree Alliance mentioned planting one on Earth. Where is this tree located?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s….”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia’s gaze inadvertently shifted to the Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods on the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If not only the souls of giants but even the World Tree itself is within….’
 </p>
 <p>
  Then it would explain the refined life force emanating despite the perfect sealing formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We should take a closer look.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Be, be careful.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan knelt to inspect the formation more closely.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As Dongbang Sak’s voice echoed, a new sealing formation began to form over the Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods.
 </p>
 <p>
  At first glance similar to the Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods, yet entirely different, the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams was drawn.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Open the formation.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon opening the formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whooooosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan and Pythia were sucked in without a chance to resist.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, be more careful, will you…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I didn’t do anything. Just now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “True, we got sucked in before touching anything. But this place…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia looked around.
 </p>
 <p>
  A single massive tree extended high into the sky, with the ground around enveloped in greenery.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Behind the tree… there’s a large lake. The interior of a sealing formation is unexpectedly peaceful.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. But this tree…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud. Thud.
 </p>

 <p>
  Seong Jihan slowly walked towards the towering tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  An exceptionally large tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  Identifying the essence of this tree, brimming with life force, became apparent through.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your ‘Eternity’ stat increases by 1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A system message quickly shed light on the situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this the World Tree planted on Earth?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Just being close to the tree saw life force gravitating towards Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  His Eternity stat, which had been stationary at 2, increased by 1 simply by nearing the tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this the World Tree? Hmm… If it is, I’m not feeling the World Tree’s unique vitality that strongly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not feeling the vitality? I’ve already gained 1 stat.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Eh? Really? Maybe because this isn’t my original body… I’m not sure.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia tilted her head, tapping Sophia’s body lightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “We have a visitor.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  By the lakeside, a person started walking slowly towards them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Holding a bamboo fishing rod over his shoulder, an old man with a white beard hanging long.
 </p>
 <p>
  His face was familiar to the two of them.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Dongbang Sak?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Dongbang Sak? Who’s that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you mean? That’s your name.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What nonsense. I am Kang Sang.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kang Sang?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Dongbang Sak’s original name. Grand Duke Kang Sang.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [PR/N: Dongbang Sak’s og name has been inspired from Jiang Ziya.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Hearing that, Seong Jihan blinked.
 </p>
 <p>
  Grand Duke Kang Sang.
 </p>
 <p>
  He didn’t know much about him but had some superficial knowledge.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t that person… a military strategist for the state of Zhou? Not a martial artist.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Also the protagonist of the Fēngshén Yǎnyì.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [PR/N: The Investiture of the Gods/ Fengshen Yanyi/ Fengshen Bang is a 16th-century Chinese novel and one of the major vernacular Chinese works in the gods and demons genre written during the Ming dynasty.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Whisper whisper.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Pythia whispered this in his ear, having Dongbang Sak right in front of them,
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak stroked his beard, his eyes twinkling.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That colored-eyed woman gave me a strange name. What kind of colored-eye person is so fluent in our language? …Are you related to that monster?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The monstrous entity?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That tree.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak pointed at the World Tree with his fishing rod.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The root of all trouble, incessantly emitting vitality, causing the head ghosts to resurrect.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you speaking of the giants’ heads?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Giants… indeed. You too are here for that monstrosity, aren’t you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, we had no business with it until….”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your ‘Eternity’ stat increases by 1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan noticed the system message and slightly curved his lips.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Perhaps now we do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Being near the World Tree had already increased his Eternity stat by 2.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the void within him rapidly expand, he attempted to control it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This level of control is manageable. Up to about 10 for Eternity now should be fine.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Having grown much since acquiring Eternity for the first time, Seong Jihan was able to somewhat suppress the collision between the two.
 </p>
 <p>
  He hadn’t figured out how to grow the stat until now.
 </p>
 <p>
  Might as well increase it while he had the chance.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan stood there, absorbing the energy of the World Tree, Dongbang Sak observed him with half-closed eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ho, absorbing the monstrosity’s vitality… And even taking its essence. The tree’s emitting vitality has weakened. If this continues, the head ghosts won’t resurrect attached to the monstrosity.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so? Then I’ll take all the tree’s vitality, and you can continue fishing, elder.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, that can’t be allowed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whirlik!
 </p>
 <p>
  The fishing line wrapped around the rod, transforming it suddenly into a bamboo staff.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh. Whoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Dongbang Sak twirled it lightly with a finger, he thrust it towards Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you take its vitality, it will surely cause another conflict elsewhere. This monstrosity needs to be sealed in its original form.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you intending to use force?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Until you’ve expelled all that vitality you’re holding.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Had he sensed the Eternity within him as well?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan furrowed his brow.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had heard from Pythia about Dongbang Sak’s strength, but not to the extent that he could instantly discern this power.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Truly a monster.’
 </p>
 <p>
  That was what Seong Jihan thought as he ignited his Eclipse.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing this, Dongbang Sak’s complexion brightened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh! Good, resist me! This will be fun!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Woosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  A staff strike coming in a straight line.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although it seemed straightforward, the nuisances I contained were not simple.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is this… the Crimson Divinity technique?’
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

 </div>
 <p>
  The Crimson Divinity Technique demonstrated by Dongbang Sak when he had descended in the body of the Taiwanese player, a fierce technique that had annihilated Seong Jihan’s body countless times.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ferocity of the martial art now exhibited by him was far more formidable than when used by the mere player Heo Wook.
 </p>
 <p>
  The staff, slicing through the void, was now seemingly oppressing the entire world.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The proficiency of the martial art, on the contrary, was more refined when executed through Heo Wook’s body.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Woosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The confident movement of Eclipse.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom! Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  Though the staff and sword never directly clashed, they caused countless explosions in the void.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ho…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak’s face was painted with intrigue.
 </p>
 <p>
  And his figure vanished from in front of Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then take this!”
 </p>
 <p>
  An onslaught enveloping Seong Jihan from all sides with the staff.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed the space was entirely dominated, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  Creeeak…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The staff couldn’t penetrate the domain commanded by Seong Jihan’s Martial Soul to the end.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This Dongbang Sak… Significantly weaker than the original Dongbang Sak.’
 </p>
 <p>
  After just two clashes, Seong Jihan realized it.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dongbang Sak before him,
 </p>
 <p>
  Or Kang Sang, was vastly different from the original Constellation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Merely by the possessed power alone, Seong Jihan’s martial prowess was superior.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should try to subdue him here, then.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Starting with the easier opponent, Kang Sang, would prepare him to later face the Constellation himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thus decided and began to press him earnestly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The battle that ensued was,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, unexpected…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seemingly, a clear advantage was on Seong Jihan’s side.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whirlwhirl…
 </p>
 <p>
  The bamboo staff burning in flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  Beard singed, Kang Sang’s body was covered in injuries.
 </p>
 <p>
  In contrast, Seong Jihan’s body remained unblemished.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even a child could easily discern who had the upper hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No effective strikes.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  The disparity in strength turned out to be even more overwhelming than expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  The combat environment was extremely favorable to him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nevertheless, Dongbang Sak, solely relying on martial arts, was enduring against him thoroughly.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the initially incomplete Crimson Divinity Technique,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good. Good! I’ve learned more today than from ten years of fishing!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Started to dazzanlingly progress after dueling with Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  In just about ten minutes,
 </p>
 <p>
  Kang Sang was closely nearing the proficiency of the Crimson Divinity Technique displayed when he used Heo Wook’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your ‘Eternity’ stat increases by 1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ve gained 3 in Eternity since coming here…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The situation of a hard-to-increase stat naturally rising just by being near the World Tree was, according to the system window, fantastic, but Seong Jihan tasted bitterness.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how strongly he pressed, he couldn’t deal effective damage to Kang Sang.
 </p>
 <p>
  If things continued this way,
 </p>
 <p>
  He might even be overtaken by Kang Sang, who was rapidly advancing, and eventually subdued.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Could this not be the Martial God…?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Why Dongbang Sak received such monstrous acclaim became achingly clear as Seong Jihan battled Kang Sang.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even with the advantage in power on his side, the situation was like this; how would it be when facing the Constellation Dongbang Sak?
 </p>
 <p>
  Within the strokes of the bamboo staff,
 </p>
 <p>
  He eerily recalled Seong Jihans, trapped within the Taiji’s Lost Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like that future might befall him too.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unable to determine the outcome after a prolonged 10-minute duel,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Pity. Is this the end now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kang Sang, who had been engrossed in battle, retreated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “As much as I’d like to duel more, pursuing my pleasure would let the giants resurrect… Now, be properly sealed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whirlik!nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
 </p>
 <p>
  The bamboo staff softened, transforming into a whip.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Final Limit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Tap!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the whip, now squirming oddly, moved,
 </p>
 <p>
  The world encasing Seong Jihan cracked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Farewell.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack!
 </p>
 <p>
  Like breaking glass, the world started vanishing.
 </p>
 <p>
  And as the world disintegrated,
 </p>
 <p>
  [You are being sealed by the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams….]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Seal attempt on an unsealable entity.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Expelled from the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan found himself, once more, outside,
 </p>
 <p>
  His body returned to the outer seabed.

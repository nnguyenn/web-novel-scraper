  Chapter 356
 </p>
 <p>
  Heterogeneous Martial Resolve.
 </p>
 <p>
  This class allows for the study and absorption of the martial arts and abilities of different species, adapting them into one’s own kind.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan had already made good use of this by watching videos of other species in the market.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Though, 95% of those were related to interspecies mating.’
 </p>
 <p>
  From the remaining 5% of the video content, Seong Jihan managed to find some stimulation to increase his Martial Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, once he had acquired a certain level of ability, further stimulation from those videos for the Heterogeneous Martial Resolve became unattainable.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just when he thought the utility of this class had reached its end,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The experiences of other species. There was something already usable.’ CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
 </p>
 <p>
  With Eternity Stat increased by 3, it had taken a form resembling the World Tree inside Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike when it was at 2, the presence of the World Tree, now more significant, was confronting the void inside him more strongly than before.
 </p>
 <p>
  And,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There’s information about the Great Golems in here too.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps it was due to receiving the life force from the World Tree sealed within Dongbang Sak’s Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Information about the Great Golems, which were sealed alongside, had also entered Seong Jihan’s possession.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had not realized this when he first emerged from the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It was only after dying thousands of times in the battle simulations against Kang Sang that I became aware.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan advanced his Martial Soul, dying countless times against Kang Sang, his Eternity attempted to regenerate his body back to its original form multiple times.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Seong Jihan always halted it when he tried to fight Kang Sang with restricted power, information about the Great Golems had also seeped in during the countless regenerations.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Before I forget, I should analyze the Great Golems’ data using the Heterogeneous Martial Resolve.’
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s what Seong Jihan decided as he delved into analyzing the Great Golem’s information.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Great Golems, a species evolved from the blood clan, possessed overwhelming power when compared to humans.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Looking at it this way, there seem to be a few cases where individual power falls short of dragons.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The species spec itself had several cases equal to that of Dragons.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the grandiose name of Great Golems, the power level of the species seemed not to be divine.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the Great Golems had a distinct feature not found in Dragons.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Great Golems can regenerate even in a soul state.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Going a step further from elves known for their roach-like regeneration ability,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Great Golems could regenerate their original form even from a soul state.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the species spec was similar to Dragonkin, it was this exceptional regenerative ability that warranted them the title of divine beings.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s see…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Through Heterogeneous Martial Resolve, Seong Jihan began his thorough analysis of them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Initially, it was hard to find immediate use from the fragmented information of the Great Golems,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Depending on the void stats, the adjustment value of the Heterogeneous Martial Resolve class became more efficient…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Recalling the class description of Heterogeneous Martial Resolve, Seong Jihan took out a mask from his inventory, that very half-mask he did not use even in his battle against Kang Sang, deciding to apply it for enhancing the efficiency of Heterogeneous Martial Resolve.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s definitely different.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The information about the Great Golems began to make sense distinctly unlike before.
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering he shouldn’t wear the mask for too long, he needed to concentrate as much as possible now.
 </p>
 <p>
  With his void amplified, Seong Jihan delved into analyzing the Great Golem’s information.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your Void increases by 2.]
 </p>
 <p>
  By the time Void increased by 2 more, his analysis was complete.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Though I couldn’t master soul regeneration from the fragmented information… I did gain some understanding of physical regeneration and the utilization of life force.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The soul regeneration was the goal the blood clan sought after through various experiments, not easily mastered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Alternatively, the sub-levels of physical regeneration and life energy utilization became accessible.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Of course, my regenerative ability is already quite good.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Having Eternity, which emits life energy indefinitely, Seong Jihan already possessed regenerative abilities enviable even to elves.
 </p>
 <p>
  Previously, his body regenerated automatically by the life force, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Now, I can utilize it more efficiently.’
 </p>
 <p>
  After embodying the Great Golem’s information, Seong Jihan could now proactively control it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This insight could also apply to Eclipse.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Eclipse, which changed from ‘Shadow of the Sun’ to ‘Shadow of Life’ and could be advanced to grade EX, hadn’t demonstrated its full capability yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though its development had been stagnant alongside the shadow power-managing Dark Shadow Techniques, now, with upgraded life energy utilization methods from the Great Golem’s data, he felt it was time to delve into researching Dark Shadow Techniques.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But first, I should head outside.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Having spent too long in the battle simulations against Kang Sang, Seong Jihan decided it was time to check up on the world’s happenings as he had lost track of the days since entering.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, stepping out of the Void Training Room, he returned to his room and moved to the living room.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ve returned earlier than expected.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Greeting him was the Shadow Queen, donning the visage of Ariel.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Did you win against that monster even in my absence?”
 </p>
 <p>
  While engaging in simulations against Kang Sang with restricted power, he had sent the Shadow Queen to Earth.
 </p>
 <p>
  She had a knack for throwing in her two cents during critical moments of training, which hindered his progress.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No. I couldn’t progress beyond a stalemate with equal offense.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Cosmic Devil… even in his human days, he was a monster. Still, to have matched him is a tremendous development.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s still not enough.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan responded, he glanced at the TV screen where the Shadow Queen had tuned into.
 </p>
 <p>
  Familiar faces appeared on the screen. The coaches of both the Korean and the American teams were being featured.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s this? Why is our country up against the U.S.?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “World Champions League? There’s such a match going on. It’s been a long match, stretching over 2 nights and 3 days since the opening.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They played one match each day, it seems.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Matches featuring Seong Jihan usually ended quickly due to his overwhelming dominance against opponents.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, in national team games, depending on the map, it was not uncommon for games to drag on.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right. Objectively, the U.S. holds the upper hand, but your family is putting up a surprisingly tough resistance. They managed a draw until the second match. But…”
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah. Player Seong Jihan’s ban has been lifted!
 </p>
 <p>
  =The 50 percent chance plays out perfectly in the 3rd match!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Could this turn the tide of victory towards the Korean team?
 </p>
 <p>
  =This turns out quite unfavorably for the United States. If Seong Jihan ends up being banned in matches 4 and 5, their chance for victory arises…
 </p>
 <p>
  =The defeat in the 1st match really hurts!
 </p>
 <p>
  BattleNet Channel 0.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the United States was ranked 1st globally, the channel featured American commentators.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since the commentators were from the U.S., they analyzed the match from a national perspective.
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon learning of Seong Jihan’s ban lift in the 3rd match, they continually expressed regret over the loss in the 1st game.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, that’s unlucky. Congratulations on your victory. Let’s ensure we ban Player Seong Jihan in matches 4 and 5.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why such a face?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s nothing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite Seong Jihan being unbanned, Coach Noh Youngjun had a grim expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Isn’t Seong Jihan back? What’s with that reaction?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Guaranteed win lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -Don’t tell me… Seong Jihan isn’t there?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ah, what nonsense ㄴㄴ
 </p>
 <p>
  -But you know, he has already missed a match because he was training.
 </p>
 <p>
  -It’s been a while since that happened, but still!
 </p>
 <p>
  Korean viewers were abuzz with speculation upon seeing Coach Noh Youngjun’s expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  And with the commence of the 3rd game,
 </p>
 <p>
  =Eh?
 </p>
 <p>
  =What’s this?
 </p>
 <p>
  =Player Seong Jihan… hasn’t participated?
 </p>
 <p>
  =Don’t tell me, Player Seong Jihan wasn’t going to play in the game?
 </p>
 <p>
  =He was definitely on the player roster!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Player Seong, might be training!
 </p>
 <p>
  The mood of the American commentators brightened as they sensed victory, and both teams’ fortunes diverged sharply.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not going?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s too late to participate in the 3rd game. Maybe I’ll go for the 4th.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright… Should I go too?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Casually crossing her legs as she sat on the sofa, the Shadow Queen pointed to herself.
 </p>
 <p>
  Beside the sofa, empty snack bags were piled high.
 </p>
 <p>
  While someone was getting decapitated by Kang Sang, she had been living the high life here.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But honestly, do I really need to go for such a game? Truthfully, if you just punch them a bit, you’d win anyway.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, come. I need to swing my sword a bit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… Can’t stand to watch others have fun, I see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Shadow Queen chuckled softly. Her form dissipated, transforming into shadow energy.
 </p>
 <p>
  This energy was then absorbed into Seong Jihan’s arm as a dark shadow.
 </p>
 <p>
  =The U.S. team. Already seizing the lead in the 3rd game!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Even more encouraging, Player Seong Jihan is not present. Even if we lose this game, with 4 and 5 left, banning either the Sword King or Yoon Seah guarantees America’s victory!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Though we handed over the Champions League, we can take the World Champions League!
 </p>
 <p>
  The American commentators, already celebrating victory, rejoiced.

 <p>
  “World Champions League huh… It might not carry much significance, but it’s not something I’d hand over lightly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan turned off the TV and smoothly stepped out through the window.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  At the Korean BattleNet Center.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re doomed…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Coach Noh Youngjun watched the progression of the 3rd game with a stern face.
 </p>
 <p>
  Until now, they had bluffed that Seong Jihan was part of the team to waste the opponent’s ban cards, but from the 4th game onward, even that wouldn’t work.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Coach. It’s just a World Champions League game, an event match…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No. This isn’t just any event match. It has implications for the BattleNet national ranking.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Korea, having won the Champions League, experienced a steep climb in the BattleNet national ranking. Currently ranked 4th, a World Champions League victory could potentially overtake India in 3rd place.
 </p>
 <p>
  From the coach’s perspective, it was a match he desperately wanted to win.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just when the ban was lifted… It would have been better if it were lifted for matches 4 and 5.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Why is it his luck only peaks when he’s unavailable?
 </p>
 <p>
  Coach Noh Youngjun murmured to himself, keeping an eye on the 3rd game.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan isn’t here! The national team is lacking him!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Without him, defeating Korea is a breeze!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s take revenge for the finals!”
 </p>
 <p>
  With the news of Seong Jihan’s absence, the morale of the U.S. team soared, confidently leading the 3rd game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, the Korean team was in a dire mood.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah shit, we’ve been found out…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re screwed, man.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “After winning the 1st game, I had some hope but…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If they ban the Sword King next game, there’s no hope left.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Winning the 3rd game but facing bans in games 4 and 5 meant an inevitable loss for the remaining games.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Korean team’s morale sank.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nonetheless, as professionals, they tried to resist against the U.S. as much as possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Again, only the Sword King and his daughter remain! Only two stood at the end.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Yoon Seah has grown to be much more than just ‘the Sword King’s daughter’; as an archer, she’s now among the most formidable players in the world!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Warrior and Archer, the simple but strong combination that took down the U.S. in the 1st game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as the American commentators hoped, the confident U.S. team gradually applied pressure on Yoon Sejin and Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even with two supremely strong players remaining, the U.S. team was formidable in their own right.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seriously, pushing with numbers is so lame!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite their resistance, Yoon Sejin and his daughter eventually fell.
 </p>
 <p>
  =The 3rd game, victory goes to the U.S.!
 </p>
 <p>
  =This game’s victory was hard-earned, but Korea’s duo nearly mounted a counterattack!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Right. They lost in a similar situation during the 1st game! Fortunately, the experience from their 1st game loss helped the U.S. team remain composed!
 </p>
 <p>
  =And unlike the 1st game, they quickly cut off Sophia!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Given Player Seong Jihan’s unavailability, it’s crucial to ban one of them!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Then, the 4th game might be easier for us to watch!
 </p>
 <p>
  The U.S. commentators, already celebrating their win in the 3rd game, and these sentiments were shared by all viewers watching this battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  -So, we end up losing the World Champions League after a long opening…
 </p>
 <p>
  -If only they protected Sophia better, such a pity.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yeah, the buff was amazing, but in the 3rd game, the U.S. guys were relentless in targeting the support.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Seems like the Yoon Sejin, Yoon Seah, Sophia trio will break up…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Definitely one of them will be banned next.
 </p>
 <p>
  -My bet’s on the Sword King.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Me too lol Yoon Seah’s been growing fast, but Yoon Sejin’s still the strongest.
 </p>
 <p>
  And as the viewers predicted, the U.S. coach decided to use the ban card on the Sword King, Yoon Sejin, for the 4th game.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I debated who to ban, but the Sword King seemed the most troublesome.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The U.S. coach spoke confidently, while Coach Noh Youngjun watched, his expression darkening.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, his lips kept twitching slightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Why is that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… It’s nothing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The U.S. coach sensed something odd in response to his question, but brushed it off as a final bluff.
 </p>
 <p>
  He maintained the current ban card selection.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, the 4th game started.
 </p>
 <p>
  =…Eh?
 </p>
 <p>
  =Hold on…
 </p>
 <p>
  The American commentators, who had been sure of victory, were at a loss for words upon seeing.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Why, why is he appearing…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The appearance of Seong Jihan in the 4th game left them unable to complete their sentences.

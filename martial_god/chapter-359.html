  Chapter 359

 <p>
  Chapter 359
 </p>
 <p>
  “She gave you this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan calmed his gaze upon seeing the book Yoon Seah handed him.
 </p>
 <p>
  The four Chinese characters written on its aged cover read, Taiji Swordsmanship.
 </p>
 <p>
  How had his sister ended up giving him this book?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Didn’t she say who gave it to her?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well… she mentioned the owner of the Abyss gave it to her?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah tilted her head, puzzled.
 </p>
 <p>
  She too had seen the owner of the Abyss during the broadcast of the apocalyptic mission Seong Jihan had undergone.
 </p>
 <p>
  The image of the giant covered in eyes was unfamiliar, as was the Taiji Swordsmanship.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Could it be from my counterpart within the Taiji’s lost soul? This.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Hearing her words, Seong Jihan speculated on the origin of the Taiji Swordsmanship.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fragments of defeated Seong Jihans that resided within the Taiji’s lost soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  They proposed to join forces with him, to fully dominate the body of the owner of the Abyss.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even during the mission, they displayed a similar power to that of the Taiji Swordsmanship.
 </p>
 <p>
  Were they so proficient with the sword to give away such a book?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s take a look.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan flipped through the book.
 </p>
 <p>
  What looked like an ancient tome from the Joseon dynasty was actually empty when he turned to the next page.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s this? It’s empty.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah mumbled in disappointment while observing with curiosity.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No. It just appears to be an old manuscript, but when you open it, text appears.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Only you can see it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seems so.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan watched as letters began to float up on the blank pages of the book.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’ve uncovered the sealed World Tree. You are the fastest among us.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The ‘us’ that the owner of the Abyss mentioned was obviously Seong Jihan himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan turned the page.
 </p>
 <p>
  [But no matter how fast, you cannot surpass the Taiji Swordsmanship. It’s proven by ‘Seong Jihan’s’ limitation, our very form.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The remnants of Seong Jihan that had failed countless times against the Taiji Swordsmanship.
 </p>
 <p>
  Remembering fragments of his own face, Seong Jihan turned the page.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yet, you will not accept defeat. You will challenge the Taiji Swordsmanship and ultimately fail. Before that, we will send the Taiji Swordsmanship to you first. Try mastering it.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Sending the swordsmanship before falling to Dongbang Sak as a precaution?
 </p>
 <p>
  Was the owner of the Abyss such an empathetic entity?
 </p>
 <p>
  Flipping to the next page revealed its real intention.
 </p>
 <p>
  [However, if you fail to obtain the Taiji Swordsmanship… you shall join us in full form.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, a system message appeared before Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Would you like to receive the Gift – Mark of the Swordsmanship?]
 </p>
 <p>
  -Gift – Mark of the Swordsmanship (Grade ??)
 </p>
 <p>
  -A conditional gift granted by the owner of the Abyss, ‘Taiji’s lost soul’.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Allows the inheritance and utilization of an incomplete Taiji Swordsmanship.
 </p>
 <p>
  -However, if the swordsmanship proficiency does not significantly improve within a year, or if the player dies completely, the player’s soul will be forcibly bound to the owner of the Abyss, ‘Taiji’s lost soul’.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
 </p>
 <p>
  -This gift will disappear if the owner of the Abyss, ‘Taiji’s lost soul’, perishes.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Mark of the Swordsmanship gift, offering an incomplete Taiji Swordsmanship, seemed worthy of an SSS grade at a glance due to its effects.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the additional conditions caught his eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I don’t improve the swordsmanship within a year, or if I die, I’ll end up with Taiji’s lost soul.’
 </p>
 <p>
  This meant not to come as a fragment after dying to Dongbang Sak, but to join the Taiji’s lost soul in full form.
 </p>
 <p>
  Why send this now and not earlier?
 </p>
 <p>
  The notable event was…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Discovering the sealed World Tree seemed to mean that much to him.‘
 </p>
 <p>
  Reviewing recent events, Seong Jihan pondered the gift.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Mark of the Swordsmanship.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unappealing by name and tough by condition, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I can’t improve the swordsmanship in a year, dying to Dongbang Sak would lead to the same outcome. And being bound after death is…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Death was, in any case, the end.
 </p>
 <p>
  Weighing the risks, Seong Jihan saw no need to decline.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll accept.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As he responded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rustle…
 </p>
 <p>
  The book crumbled away.
 </p>
 <p>
  Simultaneously.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have received the ‘Gift – Mark of the Swordsmanship’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You can now use the skill – Taiji Swordsmanship (Incomplete).]
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  The system prompted that the skill was now usable.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That was easy?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan immediately checked the skill window.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Taiji Swordsmanship]
 </p>
 <p>
  -Skill Grade: EX
 </p>
 <p>
  -A sword that reverses the natural order, annihilating the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Incomplete state, using it may consume a portion of the ‘Martial Soul’ stat.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite its incomplete state, the Taiji Swordsmanship was rated EX.
 </p>
 <p>
  The description was brief, but the grade alone implied overwhelming power.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, what caught Seong Jihan’s attention was the latter part.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…It can also use Martial Soul?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Regardless of its incompleteness, a stat reduction for using it?
 </p>
 <p>
  Thankfully, the skill description suggested ‘may be consumed’ rather than ‘will be consumed’.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, the risk of losing hard-earned stats for a single skill use was too great.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Using Taiji Swordsmanship in a public area and catching Dongbang Sak’s attention will result in him coming to kill you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The final page of the disintegrating book revealed:
 </p>
 <p>
  Using it in places like the Space League was out of the question.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I guess I’ll have to practice in the Void Training Room.’
 </p>
 <p>
  For now, Taiji Swordsmanship was merely for training.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, Seong Jihan was content.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There’s no need to use it in the Space League as there’s no opponent to match me right now. Being prepared for Dongbang Sak is good enough.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Advancing the Taiji Swordsmanship might even synergize with other martial arts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking thus, Seong Jihan was eager to head to the training room to unsheathe the sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah, I’m off to train a bit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Again?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Any pending schedules?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Space League is about 15 days away.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s plenty of time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle… aren’t you leveling up?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve got more pressing matters now. Off I go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Zoom!
 </p>
 <p>
  With a light wave, Seong Jihan vanished into a purple mist.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah blinked in surprise.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is he rushing off because of the Taiji Swordsmanship?.. Why so urgent, unlike him?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Normally, one would take a breath after emerging from the training room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just secured the Worlds Champion League, and now he’s gone again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching her uncle’s disappearance, Yoon Seah decided,
 </p>
 <p>
  “If the top ranker is doing that, I should train too….”
 </p>
 <p>
  She stretched and got up from the couch.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even as one of the top archers amongst humanity, sitting idle wasn’t an option with such a monstrous family.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Dad’s the second-best warrior. Mom’s a Constellation. Uncle’s humanity’s top ranker….”
 </p>
 <p>
  What kind of family is this?
 </p>
 <p>
  Smirking, Yoon Seah stood up and headed to the training room, but before she could leave the living room,
 </p>
 <p>
  Pop!
 </p>
 <p>
  A purple portal opened, and Seong Jihan fell out.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…How long has it been?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…A minute? Why are you back already?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The training room’s destroyed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan grimaced, recalling the recent incident.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  EX-grade skill, Taiji Swordsmanship.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though it came with conditions, Seong Jihan, who had easily acquired the skill, was eager to use it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Even a kid at Christmas isn’t this excited.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Filled with anticipation, Seong Jihan entered the training room and activated,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Taiji Swordsmanship.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Behind him, the Taiji naturally emerged, similar to when Dongbang Sak manifested in a Taiwanese player.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘How long will it keep growing?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The expanding Taiji behind him seemed boundless.
 </p>
 <p>
  Growing endlessly, the Taiji’s swirl absorbed the map and levitated in the Void Training Room.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The energy consumption is enormous, even before completing a single rotation…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Taiji Swordsmanship, depleting the entire force within his body while continually expanding, most heavily drained the void.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan employed the Crimson Divinity technique Dongbang Sak had passed down, contemplating,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But didn’t Dongbang Sak claim he didn’t manipulate the void because it doesn’t grant eternal life?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though he didn’t actively use Crimson Divinity, he claimed since he made it, it would be useful and passed it down.
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed, as Dongbang Sak said, Crimson Divinity was exceptionally helpful for Seong Jihan in manipulating the void.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  If Dongbang Sak’s words hold, then Taiji Swordsmanship shouldn’t use the void.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm… Is it because this is the Abyss owner’s version of Taiji Swordsmanship?’
 </p>
 <p>
  If he was to follow Dongbang Sak’s version, limiting the use of the void would be better.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan deliberately suppressed the use of void through Crimson Divinity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Substitute energy sources were then used, especially the Martial Soul and the stat Eternity’s life energy, combining in its place.
 </p>
 <p>
  These contributions, unlike the void’s, halted the Taiji’s limitless expansion and began to accelerate its rotation.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Martial Soul decreases by 1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Investment. An investment.’
 </p>
 <p>
  And the vanishing Martial Soul stat.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, though reluctantly, aimed to understand and develop the technique after such an expenditure.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, having used his stats, he needed to maximize understanding to evolve.
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching the world get sucked into the spinning Taiji and expanding his comprehension of the swordsmanship,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Taiji continued, the world’s collapse accelerated.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Change map settings.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Focusing on the Taiji while watching the disintegrating world, Seong Jihan tried to swap it out, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Void Training Room is on the verge of collapse.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Changing settings is not possible.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead of the map, the entire training room was crashing down.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Taiji was disrupting not just settings but the entire room’s foundation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can’t lose this place.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Void Training Room, where he controlled the flow of time, had enabled such progress till now.
 </p>
 <p>
  Losing it to the Taiji Swordsmanship would be a regrettable mistake.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan strived to contain the Taiji’s force, but
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The Taiji’s spin slowed but persisted.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Handling the aftermath is tougher than creating chaos.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Removing the Taiji turned out to be more difficult than summoning it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Engrossed in halting the Taiji’s flow,
 </p>
 <p>
  […What are you doing?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Above the collapsing world in the sky,
 </p>
 <p>
  Two stars and a crescent moon appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Positioned like a mouth and two eyes, it was a phenomenon Seong Jihan had seen before.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The owner of the Arena?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. I came because the training room is being destroyed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I wasn’t aware you also managed repairs.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [This is exceedingly rare. But that power…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  The two stars shine brightly upon seeing the Taiji.
 </p>
 <p>
  […You’ve acquired something dangerous. That power can cause internal collapse.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you know about this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [To some extent.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “For an entity of the void to know… Is the Taiji Swordsmanship not solely Dongbang Sak’s enlightenment?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I cannot provide details.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, give me a brief explanation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [One man’s enlightenment alone is insufficient. That’s all the information I can give.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s eyes lit up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Taiji Swordsmanship.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even for a monster like Dongbang Sak, it wasn’t his enlightenment alone that perfected this power.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Regardless, do not use that power here anymore.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [As you can see, the training room is collapsing.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked around.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Taiji, failing to cease, absorbed the entire world.
 </p>
 <p>
  The only presence revealing itself here was the Arena’s owner.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This time, I will repair it under my authority… But if this happens again, the training room will be confiscated.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…The Void Training Room is confiscated?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh. Then I have nowhere to practice the Taiji Swordsmanship….”
 </p>
 <p>
  [At level 500, you can upgrade the Void Training Room. Maybe you can practice there.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Hearing that, Seong Jihan found it absurd.
 </p>
 <p>
  What kind of martial arts is so demanding?
 </p>
 <p>
  Even practicing once is a challenge.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Please log out now for repairs. I’ll message you once it’s done.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, okay….”
 </p>
 <p>
  So, Seong Jihan, in the end, was expelled from his own training room.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Taiji Swordsmanship… I’ve got the skill but can’t use it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Risking the loss of the Void Training Room if he used it again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan resolved to meet the upgrade condition mentioned by the Arena’s owner.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Looks like I need to level up.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He decided to access BattleNet, which he hadn’t visited lately.

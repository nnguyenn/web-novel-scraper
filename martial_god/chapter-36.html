  Chapter 36
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  The 7th floor of the Conqueror’s Mausoleum. The place was a vast chamber, its floor and walls adorned with gold.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re finally here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Squelch!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Heal.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After Seong Jihan gave another healing to the party members who were being dragged, he looked up at the giant golden statue on the wall of the chamber.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a statue of a middle-aged man with a serene expression, proudly holding an ornate bow, mounted on a majestic horse.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though it was just a statue, an overpowering charisma emanated from it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before long, a majestic voice echoed throughout the chamber from the golden statue’s mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  [Welcome, intruders.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The voice, surprisingly welcoming to the intruders who had penetrated the deepest part of the Conqueror’s Mausoleum, continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The essence of gold is to be stolen, whether you steal it or have it stolen from you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The statue raised the hand holding the bow.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rumble!
 </p>
 <p>
  A door behind the statue opened, revealing a mountain of gold.
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you show respect to me, I shall willingly give you what you desire.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as the golden statue finished speaking, silver light began to rise from the golden floor of the chamber. Shortly after, the gold around the statue receded, revealing four small silver platforms just big enough for one person to stand on.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, this is why we needed exactly four people.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The mission of the 7th floor was simple, barring the condition that all party members had to survive. Each party member had to stand on one of the silver platforms, and every time the golden statue aimed its arrow at them, they had to bow. It was as simple as that, a mere bonus mission if everyone was alive.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan released the rope. The three party members, previously bound, now clumsily fell to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  – How will he make them bow?
 </p>
 <p>
  – They seem to be in pain, LOL.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Is he going to use telekinesis?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Isn’t the distance too far for that?
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though the viewers knew about Seong Jihan’s unique ability to use Force as telekinesis, they wondered how he’d overcome this challenge.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, to Seong Jihan, this dungeon was already as good as cleared.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This distance is within reach of my force.’
 </p>
 <p>
  While making the bound party members bow would be a complex task, controlling them with Force should enable the desired movement.
 </p>
 <p>
  Step by step, the freed party members began to move like marionettes under Seong Jihan’s control.
 </p>
 <p>
  – It seems… to be working?
 </p>
 <p>
  – What can’t he do? LOL.
 </p>
 <p>
  – I’m really curious about his status window. What kind of ability is this?
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan and the party members stood on the silver platforms, the Conqueror’s Statue began to move.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Begin.]
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">

   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The statue turned to the far-left party member and aimed its arrow at him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Black Eagle Guild’s Warrior knelt down awkwardly, yet Seong Jihan’s Force managed to make the movement resemble a bow.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Good.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The statue approved.
 </p>
 <p>
  – LOL!nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
 </p>
 <p>
  – Yay! First place again!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Nothing… happened… at all!
 </p>
 <p>
  [Next.]
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, the statue aimed its arrow at the far-right Mage.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Mage’s bow seemed more natural than the Warrior’s.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Next.]
 </p>
 <p>
  On the third turn, the Archer next to Seong Jihan made a bowing motion so perfect that it was almost indistinguishable from a natural gesture.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Is it my imagination or is his control getting better? When the Warrior did it, it seemed like a log was bowing.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Nope, not your imagination. It’s just that his telekinesis got better!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Finally, it was Seong Jihan’s turn.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Next.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ve reached the end,’ Seong Jihan thought, bowing in anticipation of completing the dungeon. The statue of the Conqueror smiled with satisfaction.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Well done. Enter.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  And just like that, the final mission of the 7th floor was effortlessly cleared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if all three teammates betrayed him, it wouldn’t make a difference.
 </p>
 <p>
  – So, they’re leveling up for free?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Lucky them, LOL.
 </p>
 <p>
  – But why isn’t he finishing it?
 </p>
 <p>
  Just a few steps away was the end of the dungeon. However, Seong Jihan hesitated, standing still.
 </p>
 <p>
  – What’s he doing?
 </p>
 <p>
  – At this rate, he might lose first place?… Nope, the second placer just entered the 4th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  – His pace is insane. He could even take a nap.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the viewers expressed their confusion, Seong Jihan let out a sigh of exasperation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Haa…”
 </p>
 <p>
  He was looking at a quest window in front of him.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hidden Quest]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Show True Respect to the statue of the Conqueror.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Reward: 5,000 Achievement Points / The Conqueror’s Arrow]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘True respect?’ Hadn’t he shown that by bowing earlier?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan pondered the words the statue had spoken earlier: [The essence of gold is to be stolen, whether you steal it or have it stolen from you]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Conqueror, the ultimate raider. What would true respect mean to such a being?
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

 <p>
  His eyes drifted to the gleaming arrow the statue held. It stood out even amidst the golden horse and the mountain of gold coins. It was a massive arrow, more like a spear by human standards.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If the reward for the achievement quest is that arrow…’
 </p>
 <p>
  How could he obtain the arrow? The answer was clear: make the statue shoot the arrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  This quest might not be easy, judging by the hefty 5,000 Achievement Points attached to it. But it didn’t matter. Seong Jihan was determined to complete this quest and get that unparalleled arrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So…”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a smirk, Seong Jihan used Force to pull the Mage towards him.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Mage, who had been hopeful about leveling up thanks to Seong Jihan’s probable first-place finish, was now filled with a foreboding sense of dread.
 </p>
 <p>
  “King of Raiders,” Seong Jihan addressed the statue.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You refer to me as the King of Raiders?] the statue responded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, let me show you true respect.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a swift motion, Seong Jihan threw the Mage towards the statue of the Conqueror.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wha… Aaah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as the Mage was about to crash into the golden horse, the statue’s mouth opened wide and swallowed him whole.
 </p>
 <p>
  – What just happened???
 </p>
 <p>
  – Why did he do that after coming so far?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Has he lost his mind?
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers, who thought the game was over and were about to leave, were now filled with bewilderment and shock at the unexpected turn of events.
 </p>
 <p>
  [How dare you?] The statue of the Conqueror seemed taken aback.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, with a serene expression, Seong Jihan pointed at the arrow. “The most valuable thing here… isn’t the gold behind that door. It’s your arrow.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Oh? And?]
 </p>
 <p>
  With a glint in his eye, Seong Jihan stated, “I’m going to take it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Drawing the sword he had taken from the warrior, he continued, “Taking the most precious thing by force. That is the respect I show to the King of Raiders.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [HAHAHAHAHA!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “That is the way of King of Raiders”
 </p>
 <p>
  The entire chamber echoed with laughter. Mountains of gold that had been neatly piled behind the statue scattered recklessly. But no one in the room cared about the gold now.
 </p>
 <p>
  [To think I thought of you as a mere grave robber when you bowed earlier…] The statue aimed its bow at Seong Jihan, and its demeanor entirely changed, emitting an overpowering aura.
 </p>
 <p>
  [A discerning eye for value and the ambition to seize it with force. Admirable.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The arrow tip emitted a fierce energy, the flames engulfing it so hot that the gold coins at the statue’s feet melted.
 </p>
 <p>
  [As you say, that is my way! You made me remember the old days. Yes, you have shown me the utmost respect!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The bowstring was pulled taut.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Thus, I bestow upon you: Phoenix’s Arrow!]
 </p>
 <p>
  True to its grand name, the intense heat from the arrow filled the entire chamber. The statue’s intent was clear: If you can catch it, you can keep it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flames erupted on the bodies of the Warrior and Archer, burning them fiercely.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Even if they die, it’s of no concern to me,’ Seong Jihan thought. The problem was that the sword he was holding belonged to the warrior. If the warrior died, the sword would be recalled to his inventory.
 </p>
 <p>
  The intensity of the Phoenix Arrow was overwhelming. To intercept it directly was nearly impossible.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this mission even meant to be completed?” Seong Jihan mused. He remembered the surprise he felt during the defense map when the Flesh Golem appeared. But this situation was far more dire.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if he had reached the Gold League as a Warrior, that arrow was unstoppable.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If that arrow leaves the bowstring, even I might not be able to block it,” Seong Jihan realized.
 </p>
 <p>
  And time was running out as the chamber transformed into an inferno.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s sharp gaze focused on the bowstring. “I’ll strike first.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He poured all his energy into the sword. A combination of Divine Power and Mana: Force and even his Ki. The energy from the unification of the three Dantians was so immense that the sword seemed about to explode.
 </p>
 <p>
  With determination, Seong Jihan unleashed a powerful technique.
 </p>

  Chapter 360
 </h3>

 <p>
  Chapter 360
 </p>
 <p>
  – Lately, Seong Jihan has been frequently streaming haha.
 </p>
 <p>
  – But it all ends within 10 minutes anyway…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Well, even in the Grandmaster League, taking down kids in one hit remains the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  During the repair period of the Void Training Room, Seong Jihan consistently played a game a day.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Leveling up has become quite sluggish.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps it was due to reaching the Grand Master League.
 </p>
 <p>
  The leveling process wasn’t as smooth as before.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even securing first place in each game, it could take two to three matches just to gain one level.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘At this rate, reaching level 500 could take a year.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Accustomed to rapid growth until now, Seong Jihan frowned at the slowed pace of leveling up.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had to reach 500 to properly research the Taiji Swordsmanship in the Void Training Room.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it took a year to reach level 500, he could be absorbed by the owner of the Abyss by the time the Void Training Room was upgraded.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Isn’t there a special mission or something?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Special missions had always been a reliable means of leveling up.
 </p>
 <p>
  While such missions were somewhat frequent in the lower leagues, they were nowhere to be seen now that he was playing games in the Grand Master League.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he just kept playing normal games like this, leveling up would be too slow.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to participate not only in the Arena but also in anything related to combat to level up faster.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, as Seong Jihan pondered finding ways to level up beyond normal games,
 </p>
 <p>
  The chatrooms for humanity, typically delighted just to see him play, contrasted starkly with the alien chatrooms, which recently had been filled with complaints about the game footage.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Is it over already?
 </p>
 <p>
  – How mundane… How long does he plan to stay in this league with such power?
 </p>
 <p>
  – I was interested in this rookie for showing such powerful potential, but if this is all that comes out, I might unsubscribe.
 </p>
 <p>
  – With that level of strength, he could proceed with at least 50 percent of his abilities sealed.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Even with a seal over 50 percent, he should manage first place without any struggles.
 </p>
 <p>
  – What’s this about sealing… Most would lose in that case.
 </p>
 <p>
  – There are still many holding a grudge over lost money.
 </p>
 <p>
  While they talked about unsubscribing if he continued only showing such games, a word that frequently popped up was “seal.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seal?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, puzzled by this, received an explanation from the Shadow Queen who had been viewing the chat alongside him.
 </p>
 <p>
  [From the Grandmaster League, you can seal some of your stats during a game to gain greater rewards. They might be referring to that.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “There was something that good? Why didn’t you tell me earlier?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The risk of stat sealing isn’t worth the reward usually, so it’s rarely used. Plus, the penalty ratio for losing also increases significantly.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really? How much does the reward increase?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’d have to seal more than half your stats to get double the rewards.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Sealing more than half of one’s stats.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan considered his own stats: Martial Soul, Void, Red, and Eternity.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It seems doable.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if not half, with just Martial Soul remaining, he should manage just fine in the Grand Master League.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I should do it right away, then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Um… I wouldn’t recommend it, personally. You can’t pick and choose which stats to seal per map. You’d have to start the game matching in a sealed state. If you get a special mission map by bad luck, you’d have to fight with your powers bound.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll take that risk.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In typical situations, with strength, health, agility, and similar physical abilities being separate, the impact of sealing might indeed be significant.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But since Martial Soul encompasses all those abilities, it’s worth trying.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Decided on sealing, Seong Jihan looked for where this option might be.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, before matching for a game, he noticed an added sealing option in the BattleNet menu screen at the bottom.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How did I not notice this until now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You were just pressing the matching button without looking, I guess.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Maybe.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Discovering the sealing option, Seong Jihan touched it.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Would you like to seal your abilities?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Based on the proportion of sealed abilities, the rewards from the next matching game will increase. However, the penalties for losing will also escalate accordingly.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A warning about ability sealing appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  The reward increases, but so does the penalty.
 </p>
 <p>
  From this alone, it was clear why the Shadow Queen wasn’t keen on recommending it.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Seong Jihan had the almost universal stat of Martial Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m sealing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He proceeded to seal Void, Red, and Eternity in turn.
 </p>
 <p>
  With three out of four abilities sealed,
 </p>
 <p>
  [In the next matching game, only one of the four abilities will be active.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Based on the proportion of abilities sealed, both rewards and penalties will increase fourfold.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The rewards and penalties increased fourfold.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh. Four times. I should have done this sooner.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Four times? How many abilities did you seal?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Three out of four.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […Wait, so can you even fight? That’s too greedy. What if you hit a special mission? You should probably cancel the match and unseal something.]
 </p>

 <p>
  The Shadow Queen spoke faster than usual, trying to dissuade Seong Jihan, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Match found.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The game starts now.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s already too late.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite reaching Grandmaster, matching was still lightning fast.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [A Special Mission will commence.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have been assigned to the Special Survival Map, ‘Graveyard of Stars’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A special mission map, longed for yet elusive, was assigned just as he sealed his abilities.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Graveyard of Stars? Of all maps, we landed on this one…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Sighing at the map selection, the Shadow Queen said,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Let’s take the quadruple penalties and start again from level 400.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What kind of map is it that you say such things?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [A place where once dominant Constellations who lost most of their power are buried.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Special Survival Map Graveyard of Stars.
 </p>
 <p>
  This location had stringent conditions just for entry.
 </p>
 <p>
  Reserved for Grand Master League players or higher who hold the candidacy for being a constellation.
 </p>
 <p>
  [In the Graveyard of Stars, fallen predecessors invite candidates for Constellations.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Gain the support of predecessors to overpower your opponents.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The more concentrated the support, the more powerful the player becomes.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Gaining support from buried Constellations to overpower opponents sounded intriguing to Seong Jihan as he glossed over the messages popping up about the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is it the Graveyard of Stars he’s been matched in?
 </p>
 <p>
  -That’s a match worth seeing.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But wait… he’s in a sealed state?
 </p>
 <p>
  The alien viewers, noticeably fewer than before, started to react.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially,
 </p>
 <p>
  -Four times the rewards? Doesn’t reaching that level of reward necessitate sealing most abilities…?
 </p>
 <p>
  -He saw the chat from last time! Give us a seal show here, hahaha.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Thought it was a normal mission? But unfortunately caught a special mission, did you? Off to level 400, then?
 </p>
 <p>
  -My GP lost to the little sun… finally feels a bit compensated!!
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why blame him for their own betting losses?
 </p>
 <p>
  -That’s typical of bettors… ever seen them blame themselves for losing money?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing Seong Jihan’s sealed ability status on BattleTube, those who lost bets on Little Sun started to get excited.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan continuously soared, eagerly anticipating his downfall, the number of alien viewers skyrocketed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Human viewers really are of a different stripe.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, noticing aliens fervently praying for his downfall, couldn’t help but chuckle.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s more satisfying to crush such expectations.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  The early progression of the game wasn’t very optimistic.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What kind of map is so barren?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Graveyard of Stars.
 </p>
 <p>
  A map lighted by starlight instead of the sun, it was laid out with desolate stretches of land.
 </p>
 <p>
  Had it not been for the giant statues scattered sparsely across the land, the place would have seemed entirely empty.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This one resembles a dragon.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan approached the statue nearest to him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Constellation ?? shows interest in you…….]
 </p>
 <p>
  A message appeared before Seong Jihan as the giant dragon statue’s eyes momentarily lit up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Zing…
 </p>
 <p>
  After a quick scan from the dragon statue’s eyes, the light vanished, and
 </p>
 <p>
  [Constellation ?? withdraws its interest upon discovering your abilities are sealed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The message concluded with the withdrawal of interest.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Finally, we’re going to see this guy lose.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Who would want to support a player with sealed abilities hahaha?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Right, those Constellations need to pick well and support to regain their power. They’ll only sponsor someone promising.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Exactly. They’re a hundred times more desperate than players whining about lost bets.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aliens were delighted to see Seong Jihan failing to gain any support.
 </p>
 <p>
  And this situation kept repeating.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Constellation ?? shows interest in you…….]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Why did you come with your abilities sealed? It lectures you on your arrogance.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Constellation ?? ignores your insignificant presence.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, receiving nothing but reprimands for his sealed abilities and being shunned for humanity’s small stature, frowned, not even getting sponsorship but rather scoldings.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Forget the sponsorship, I just wish I’d run into another player already.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s the initial sponsorship phase now; opponents won’t appear yet. After the Constellations’ sponsorship procedures are completed, the real survival starts.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  While rivals were gathering strength with sponsorships, he was being ignored by the Constellations.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This initial gap seems significant.’
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Already with only Martial Soul unsealed, and without any sponsorship bonus from Constellations, the challenge seemed daunting.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though the difficulty had escalated due to the seal, Seong Jihan smirked, seemingly pleased.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Lately, the games were too boring, right? Now, it seems like it’ll get interesting.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to the simulation battles with Kang Sang, the marathon of regular game matches had been dull.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the Void Training Room under repair and simulations on hold, Seong Jihan found the increase in difficulty rather welcome.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course,
 </p>
 <p>
  – Posing strong… but he’ll likely flee once the game starts.
 </p>
 <p>
  – The grudge from losing GP will finally be resolved watching him crumble…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Will his downfall in this game suffice? I think he needs to be demoted from the Grandmaster League to feel satisfied.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Honestly, Seong Jihan doesn’t seem like he’d get demoted, even if he messes up this game haha.
 </p>
 <p>
  Alien viewers mocked his show of strength, fervently wishing for Seong Jihan’s ruin.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, about five minutes passed,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Survival commences.]
 </p>
 <p>
  With the game proceeding as announced,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  Beams of light exploded from all sides.
 </p>
 <p>
  Revealing players of various races.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though their appearances differed, they all had one thing in common.
 </p>
 <p>
  – What’s with those light pillars?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Suddenly, beams of light from the night sky? Haha.
 </p>
 <p>
  – It’s too conspicuous, isn’t it? Stealth is totally out of the question.
 </p>
 <p>
  Beams of light from above the night sky continually shone down on the players.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were variations in intensity and color, but light fell on everyone.
 </p>
 <p>
  Except one.
 </p>
 <p>
  Excluding Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that light from receiving Constellations’ sponsorship?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. Sponsorship from the Constellations here significantly influences the game. Players like you, who didn’t receive any, usually drop out early.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Shadow Queen finished explaining,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the pillars of light nearby
 </p>
 <p>
  began to rapidly approach him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not getting any sponsorship… You must be quite weak!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Approaching was a gigantic crocodile-like monster, deeming Seong Jihan easy prey and rushing to devour him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Was it due to the Constellations’ sponsorship?
 </p>
 <p>
  The opponent’s movements and the aura exuded were indeed stronger than typical match opponents but,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Still, this seems manageable.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Fundamental Divine Arts, 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  Triad of Martial Mastery:
 </p>
 <p>
  Mount Tai Suppression
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzap!
 </p>
 <p>
  The sword’s motion left a giant wound on the crocodile’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Argh…! What is this…! You shouldn’t have any sponsorships?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssssh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Stunned, the crocodile momentarily halted to regenerate, looking at Seong Jihan, who gave off a faint smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Couldn’t take it down in one hit?”
 </p>
 <p>
  After climbing to Grand Master League, it had been monotonous with everything falling in one hit.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, this seemed more like a challenge.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s sword moved several more times.
 </p>
 <p>
  With each motion, deep scars were imprinted on the opponent’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Argh…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  After the fifth movement of the sword, the crocodile’s body was completely torn apart.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thump. Thump…
 </p>
 <p>
  The crocodile’s head rolled to Seong Jihan’s feet.
 </p>
 <p>
  He looked down, muttering disappointedly,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Couldn’t last five hits.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […What? Didn’t you seal your stats?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, three out of four.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [But… you don’t seem to alleviate your power. Isn’t it the same as always?]
 </p>
 <p>
  After all, the Triad of Martial Mastery utilized only Martial Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, unfazed, kicked away the crocodile’s head, scouting for the next opponent when,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  [Constellation ?? shows significant interest in you……]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Constellation ?? intends to sponsor you. Do you accept?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The dragon-shaped statue, having observed Seong Jihan’s strength, shone its eyes brightly again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Maybe now it thought he was worth sponsoring even in a sealed state.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Quick to flip the script, aren’t they?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Such was the nature of BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan sneered, considering whether to accept the sponsorship,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Epic Quest]
 </p>
 <p>
  – Secure 1st place in the Graveyard of Stars without any Constellations’ sponsorship.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Reward: Constellation Fame 100,000, Graveyard of the Stars Spoils
 </p>
 <p>
  An epic quest unfolded before him.

 <p>
  Chapter 361
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘An epic quest, it’s been a while. But spoils, huh…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Graveyard of Stars, in essence, a tomb of Constellations.
 </p>
 <p>
  The spoils buried here would undoubtedly belong to a Constellation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Even if those here were defeated, they once held the title of Constellations, so the spoils should be valuable items.’
 </p>
 <p>
  And with a hundred thousand fame from Constellations on top of that.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was a quest that absolutely had to be undertaken.
 </p>
 <p>
  Had he known there was such an epic quest, he would have been more cautious with sealing his stats.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But being in a sealed state… Could the epic quest reward be quadrupled too?’
 </p>
 <p>
  He’ll have to find out as he clears it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought as much and accepted the epic quest.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [You refuse the sponsorship of Constellation ??]
 </p>
 <p>
  The sponsorship from the Constellation was automatically declined.
 </p>
 <p>
  -?? Did he just decline the sponsorship?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why decline? Wasn’t it an entity that was initially refusing to sponsor?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Just because of that petty reason, he’s declining?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Phew… I thought I was going to have to watch him take first place again, luckily I won’t have to.
 </p>
 <p>
  Alien viewers were perplexed by Seong Jihan’s choice.
 </p>
 <p>
  Declining sponsorship from a Constellation in this map was considered an absurd action.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, Seong Jihan continued to do so.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Constellation ?? offers to enhance your size to compensate for your weakness.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Constellation ??, impressed by your qualification for arrogance, promises full sponsorship.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Initially declined, Constellations continuously sent overtures of love, all of which were refused by Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  -He’s declining all Constellations at the starting point… Really gone mad haha.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Just wants to quit the game fast, it seems.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Isn’t he being too careless just because he easily defeated one crocodile? The opponents will become significantly stronger as Constellations’ sponsorships stack.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Defeating Little Sun made him too arrogant…
 </p>
 <p>
  While alien viewers commented, knowing nothing about the epic quest content,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash! Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  From afar within the map, new pillars of light began erupting.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some were newly created, while others, previously existing pillars of light, expanded and brightened, showing an enhanced form.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It seems another round of Constellations’ sponsorship has begun.’
 </p>
 <p>
  And with newly empowered pillars of light moving actively,
 </p>
 <p>
  Those who received Constellations’ sponsorship multiple times began searching for weaker opponents to attack relentlessly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There are still players who haven’t received any sponsorship…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A giant bird resembling an eagle, who had sought out Seong Jihan, was one among them.
 </p>
 <p>
  An opponent with a much stronger pillar of light than the one Seong Jihan had defeated earlier.
 </p>
 <p>
  As it spread its wings wide,
 </p>
 <p>
  Sizzle…
 </p>
 <p>
  Intense electricity began to emanate from where it stood.
 </p>
 <p>
  Along with that, the feathers composing its wings converted into electricity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Half of the giant bird’s body was then occupied by blue thunderbolts.
 </p>
 <p>
  -A Thunderbird. With that level of electric power, it’s quite skillful…
 </p>
 <p>
  -That’s why it received so much sponsorship from Constellations.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Are we finally going to see his downfall?
 </p>
 <p>
  -With the Thunderbird discharging that power from the sky, it’s impossible to counter.
 </p>
 <p>
  -He’s done for hahaha
 </p>
 <p>
  Alien viewers took Seong Jihan’s defeat for granted.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s how intense the thunder and lightning the Thunderbird summoned from the sky seemed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Krrr!
 </p>
 <p>
  Lightning poured down from its wings towards Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each strand of electric current was intense enough to pierce the earth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan instinctively took out the Phoenix Flag, attempting to exhibit Dragon Thunder, when he remembered,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Ah, I’m in a sealed state.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzt…
 </p>
 <p>
  The current erupting from the spear’s tip was distinctly different from the usual Dragon Thunder.
 </p>
 <p>
  Returning to the white color seen when he first used the Divine Thunder Decree.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Even so, this seems more than enough.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps due to the countless fierce battles with Dongbang Sak,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s standards were significantly heightened.
 </p>
 <p>
  The intense electricity unleashed by the Thunderbird seemed fraught with weaknesses from his perspective.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan aimed his spear towards the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fundamental Divine Arts,
 </p>
 <p>
  Divine Thunder Decree:
 </p>
 <p>
  Striking Thunderbolt
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  From the ground to the sky, lightning ascended in reverse.
 </p>
 <p>
  “To use the power of lightning against me…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Initially, the giant bird sneered at this, but the Striking Thunderbolt rising from the Phoenix Flag moved as if alive, severing the Thunderbird’s electric strands from their roots.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is it, could it have been hiding sponsorship? How…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bewildered by the exquisite movement, the Thunderbird attempted to gather more electric power, but before it could fully harness it, the Eclipse cut across the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Thunderbird’s head flew off, falling to the ground from the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thump!
 </p>
 <p>
  And simultaneously, the massive body of the Thunderbird crashed to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Constellations’ sponsorship, nothing much to it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan glanced briefly at the vanishing corpse of the Thunderbird and surveyed his surroundings.
 </p>
 <p>
  Far off, light pillars entangled, fighting each other.
 </p>
 <p>
  Those must be players under Constellation sponsorship battling each other.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘To take first place, securing kills is paramount, I better hurry up and finish them off myself.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Having assessed Constellations’ sponsorship as not very threatening from facing two players, Seong Jihan decided to go on the offensive.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  His form vanished.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before long, pillars of light here and there began dimming.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  -Already 20 kills?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Even without Constellations’ sponsorship, to show such overwhelming dominance…
 </p>
 <p>
  -He beat the Sun King’s Little Sun, wouldn’t he win here too? We were too hopeful haha.
 </p>
 <p>
  -No, but with stats sealed, it’s natural to assume… does that even make sense? lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -All the summoned candidates here were promising Constellations, yet they’re just getting swept aside;
 </p>
 <p>
  Alien viewers who had been eager for Seong Jihan’s defeat.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the unfolding game did not align with their wishes.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Continually challenging Dongbang Sak paid off.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Zap!
 </p>
 <p>
  A dragon’s head sent flying into the distance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, even with only Martial Soul at his disposal, displayed might today that seemed even stronger than before his stats were sealed, easily overpowering his opponents.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Are you sure only one stat is active? How is this possible? It seems even stronger than usual?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “My stats are pretty useful. The infinite sparring helped too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Even so, still… Sigh…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching Seong Jihan annihilating enemies, the Shadow Queen sighed, seemingly exasperated.
 </p>
 <p>
  To her common sense, it was incomprehensible that a player with just one stat remaining could so effortlessly sweep aside opponents, even those enhanced by Constellations’ sponsorship.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Krh… Kugh…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Zap!
 </p>
 <p>
  Easily overcoming an opponent enhanced three times, Seong Jihan glanced at the scoreboard.
 </p>
 <p>
  With 20 kills to his name, and the second place with 8 kills, the gap between him and the second place had become insurmountable.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘At this rate, I could just run away and still win first place.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your level increases by 1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Due to his stats being sealed, downing 20 players resulted in a level up.
 </p>
 <p>
  To reach level 500, he couldn’t afford to dilly dally.
 </p>
 <p>
  More opponents had to be eliminated to gain even one more level.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan searched the surrounding light pillars,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Wonder what spoils I’ll receive.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering the mission as good as cleared, he pondered what rewards he would get.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Or maybe, it’ll be a random selection without choice. If it’s something mediocre, the hundred thousand fame will be the main reward.’𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  With a hundred thousand constellation fame, he could upgrade his Constellations traits too.
 </p>
 <p>
  Maybe compared to the unpredictable spoils from Constellations, this could be considered the main reward.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Constellation ?? presses, really refusing to accept sponsorship?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Constellation ?? pleads, begging to at least accept sponsorship, promising immense rewards if you manage to escape the graveyard, offering you additional bonus conditions.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Constellation ?? attempts to enlighten you with BattleNet’s secrets, claiming that with this knowledge, you could become an administrator, offering unreliable information.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan secured 1st place with still no Constellations supporting him, the static Constellations grew increasingly desperate to sponsor him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Had it not been for the epic quest automatically declining them, he would have been bogged down in responding to each offer instead of progressing in the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Why are these guys so persistent?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Do they get released if the player they sponsor wins first place?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned at the Constellations bombarding his message box.
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering their behavior, their spoils didn’t seem too promising.
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching the Constellations’ disgraceful acts, he began to worry about the rewards.
 </p>
 <p>
  Zap!
 </p>
 <p>
  He approached another player, mechanically separating yet another adversary.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Damn it… the sponsorship from Constellations was cut off!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s all because of that monster! The Constellations already think he’s secured 1st place…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We must join forces against that man…! Defeat is inevitable otherwise!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha. As if that would work. That beast is on a different level… Better to score one more kill instead!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The remaining players gathered to confront Seong Jihan, but now only 12 were left.
 </p>
 <p>
  Defeated by his overpowering might, a few resolved instead to sneak in more kills, backstabbing other players.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  ‘Really? They’re fighting amongst themselves.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Why are those I need to defeat for leveling up causing internal strife?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing 12 light pillars entangled in combat, Seong Jihan quickly approached.
 </p>
 <p>
  Time to conclude this special mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssshhh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The shadow cast by the Eclipse Sword greatly expanded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as Seong Jihan was about to end the game with this strike,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Constellation ?? complains, asking what on earth is going on.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Constellation ?? outraged, questions why you’re plundering items.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Constellation ?? declares this situation utterly intolerable and erupts in fury.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, Constellations that had been trying to curry favor with Seong Jihan now vehemently expressed their rage.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Because of the spoils?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Or, was the system already collecting them even before the game had finished?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, seeing the Constellations’ backlash in his message box, decided to swiftly eliminate the remaining players first.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nameless Divine Art,
 </p>
 <p>
  Triad of Martial Mastery:
 </p>
 <p>
  Total Annihilation Horizontal Sweep
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as the immense Eclipse Sword sliced horizontally,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The light pillars sponsoring the 12 players suddenly shone brilliantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Radiant pillars twinkled in a rainbow hue.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What, what’s going on….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why are Constellations suddenly…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The fighting players momentarily paused, engulfed in a powerful blessing.
 </p>
 <p>
  [We endure humiliation here, clinging on in hopes of once again standing alone as Constellations.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [And you intend to take my weapons? This person…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Even if you achieve an overwhelming 1st place in the Graveyard of Stars, this act is unforgivable!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [My weapon cannot be taken at any cost!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Echoes of the Constellations’ bitter cries resonated from all directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Their sponsorship began to pour onto the 12 players indiscriminately.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Eclipse Sword was deflected by the super-enhanced light pillars.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, such formidable power.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Constellations have truly bestowed their blessings…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “With this power, we can certainly suppress him!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s deal with our fight after we take down that monster!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the Eclipse Sword deflected, the players’ eyes gleamed intensely.
 </p>
 <p>
  To avoid losing their items, the Constellations showered them with unprecedented sponsorship.
 </p>
 <p>
  Feeling the might of this power, they believed they could sufficiently challenge the monster.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll take him down!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A monkey-like monster was the first to charge at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  An opponent now excessively strengthened by Constellations’ amplified sponsorship was indeed different from his previous encounters.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang! Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  The monkey beast struck the earth with overwhelming force.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘With Eternity sealed, regeneration from such hits is impossible.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan stepped back, assessing the opponent’s strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘One on one like this might be manageable, but with all twelve charging, it’s too much even for me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Had his stats not been sealed, he might have taken them on, but now his power was restricted.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is the system doing this on purpose? This is too much meddling.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan furrowed his brows, deciding to retreat and pick them off one by one.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he backed away, the overjoyed monkey beast shouted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where do you think you’re running? Stop!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  His fist pounded the earth, creating cracks that erupted explosively.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unable to contain its overflowing power, the opponent sought any opportunity to use it.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan dodged the onslaught, luring the beast further backward,
 </p>
 <p>
  Crash!
 </p>
 <p>
  The monkey beast’s fist struck the ground near a Constellation’s statue.
 </p>
 <p>
  The statue of the Constellation slightly cracked.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You…! Where are you throwing your punches!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… I couldn’t control my strength.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do that once more, and I’m withdrawing my sponsorship!]
 </p>
 <p>
  From the cracked statue, the fuming voice of a Constellation was heard.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seems like breaking those isn’t allowed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Observing closely, Seong Jihan caught a glimpse of a faint spirit emerging from the cracked statue.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So inside the statues lie the spirits of the Constellations…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Spirits, huh…
 </p>
 <p>
  He had just the technique for dealing with spirits.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Had you not assisted them and ended it, you would’ve merely lost an item and the game would be over.’
 </p>
 <p>
  You started this.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan smiled, ready to proceed.

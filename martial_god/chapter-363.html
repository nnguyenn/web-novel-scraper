  Chapter 363
 </p>
 <p>
  Fundamental Divine Arts,
 </p>
 <p>
  Annihilation God’s Secret:
 </p>
 <p>
  Ice Sword Rain of the Frozen Heaven
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssshhh…
 </p>
 <p>
  From the frozen Eclipse, the sword rain began to stretch out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Diversifying into several parts, it targeted the Constellations’ armaments amidst the over one hundred items.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ultimately, the icy blades converged upon three objects.
 </p>
 <p>
  The one with the least sword rain on it was a golden cape; its radiant fabric was large enough to fit dozens of Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is something I’ll have to pass on to someone else anyway. If that’s the case, something of higher value would be preferable…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The cape with the least amount of sword rain was consequently disregarded.
 </p>
 <p>
  While doing so, Seong Jihan examined the next item.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A greatsword?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The second most targeted item by the sword rain was a large blue greatsword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though it was also too large for Seong Jihan to wield, unlike the cape, it seemed somewhat more feasible to use if necessary.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm… doesn’t look too bad.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan scrutinized the sword then surveyed the next item.
 </p>
 <p>
  The last object, which attracted more than half of the sword rain, was something bizarre to be called a Constellation’s armament.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a mass of skulls floating in the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is a weapon?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan cocked his head as he closely inspected it.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was an object formed from various species’ skulls clustered together into a giant star shape.
 </p>
 <p>
  It didn’t seem at all practical as a weapon.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Seems utterly impractical…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Had the sword rain not indicated it, Seong Jihan would have had no interest in the item.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, trusting the exploratory capability of the Ice Sword Rain, which had previously brought him benefits, he couldn’t simply overlook it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If it’s about practicality, the greatsword. If I trust the sword rain, then it’s the skull star…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The latter it is, then.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssshhhh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan approached the skull star and reached out his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, a system message appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do you wish to select this spoil?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With Seong Jihan’s response, the ascended Constellations’ armaments began to disappear one after another.
 </p>
 <p>
  And when all items vanished, a sorrowful voice emanated from the quiet skull star.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You…! This is the essence I’ve gathered over thousands of years! It shouldn’t be taken away like this…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, it talks?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. I am the supreme Constellation Tainus. You have heard of my name… haven’t you?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not at all.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan shook his head, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tainus?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Shadow Queen within the Eclipse reacted with surprise upon hearing the name.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you know who that is?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Before the era of the Martial God, there was a monster who hunted Constellations. He was eventually defeated by a coalition of Constellations and vanished. So he was here all along.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If it predates the era of Martial God, it’s just an ancient Constellation.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hmph, unheard of… Time has indeed passed. I was once a Constellation aspiring to become a Great Constellation. I’m confined in the tomb for now, but I’ll soon emerge and resume my activities.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Tainus tried to boast about his past prestige and the value of his armament, asserting he was a significant being who once aspired to become a Great Constellation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh? Aspired to be a Great Constellation, you say. If such a notable being owned it, the item must be extremely valuable, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  However, this backfired. Hearing this made Seong Jihan think there was a reason why the sword rain pointed it out.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  Sensing Seong Jihan’s thoughts, the skull star hastily made an offer.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Bastard… Constellation candidate, let’s negotiate. If you return this item to me, I will serve you loyally for a thousand years.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “A thousand years… When are you coming out?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Very soon. Just a hundred years more…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just a hundred years?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Constellations indeed have a different concept of time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan chuckled and firmly held the skull star.
 </p>
 <p>
  “A hundred years later, the situation will already be over. Don’t worry. I’ll put your spoil to good use, so just rest.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Wait, just a moment…! Alright, 50 years, I’ll manage to shorten it to 50 years!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “No need. I’ll be retired by then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Immediate usability was better than waiting for a distant fifty years’ help.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do you wish to become the owner of ‘The Essence of the Sovereign’?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ignoring Tainus’s pleas, Seong Jihan became the owner of the essence.
 </p>
 <p>
  Subsequently, the item description appeared.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">

 </p>
 <p>
  [The Essence of the Sovereign]
 </p>
 <p>
  – Grade: EX
 </p>
 <p>
  – A special item crafted by the supreme Constellation Tainus in pursuit of the ‘Sovereign’ trait.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Absorbing the essences of 444 sovereign Constellations will grant an additional sovereign trait.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Currently, 127 sovereign Constellations have been subdued.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s eyes sparkled upon seeing the item’s grade.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although it had only reached 127 Constellations thus far, making a long way from completion, the potential to add another Constellation trait ranked the item comfortably within the EX grade.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…I’ve already applied it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who had already purchased both traits from the Constellation shop, realized how exploitative the shop system connected from the achievement store was.
 </p>
 <p>
  A trait easily bought with points in the Constellation shop, albeit incomplete, was EX grade here.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Should I sell it?’
 </p>
 <p>
  An item picked by the sword rain.
 </p>
 <p>
  Successful in grade but rendered useless due to the store.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan pondered this, staring at the skull, a message appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have already acquired the ‘Sole Sovereignty’ trait.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The incomplete ‘Essence of the Sovereign’ can enhance the ‘Sole Sovereignty’ trait.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do you wish to enhance the ‘Sole Sovereignty’ effect?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if incomplete, the essence held significant potency to propose enhancing the sovereign trait effect.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan glanced at the skull star for a moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘An item that can enhance traits… Perhaps too valuable to easily sell or trade. Better if I use it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  After some contemplation, Seong Jihan pressed yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The efficiency of the ‘Sole Sovereignty’ trait increases. The increase in all stats changes from 150% to 200%, and gaining Constellation Fame from sponsored players becomes easier.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The number of players you can sponsor increases by 2,000.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sole Sovereignty trait’s efficiency enhanced in various aspects.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, since Seong Jihan had turned off the trait, he didn’t feel much of an impact from the change.
 </p>
 <p>
  Originally the 150% increase was applying as 1.5% due to being turned off.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even with the increase to 200%, the practical effect felt like only a slight increase to 2%.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘For an item that can add a Constellation trait, the effect seems underwhelming.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Should he have sold it instead of using it?
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan pondered the lackluster effect,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Adds an evolution bonus to the race you reign over.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Strength +5]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Agility +5]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Endurance +5]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Mana +5]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Choose one of the following.]
 </p>
 <p>
  An unexpected message arrived.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  After the game ended,
 </p>
 <p>
  BattleTube did not broadcast Seong Jihan receiving his rewards, concluding the streaming.
 </p>
 <p>
  -So Seong Jihan wins the special map again.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But why is he playing a different game all by himself?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Lol, how many special maps has he been to now? Other players barely get a chance to see one.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Other players have about a 50% win rate. Try hitting close to 100% like Seong Jihan does. They’d definitely send you to special missions.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the remaining viewers chatted about why Seong Jihan was playing a different game,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  The dim screen lit up once more.
 </p>
 <p>
  -??
 </p>
 <p>
  -What’s happening? I thought the broadcast ended?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Seems like the game ended. That’s a penthouse.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh, a live from reality?
 </p>
 <p>
  -How long has it been since we had one of these? Lol
 </p>
 <p>
  And what the viewers saw on the new screen was the living room of the penthouse.
 </p>
 <p>
  There, with a grave face, was Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… where was it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  He was touching the air here and there.
 </p>
 <p>
  -What is he doing?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Looks like he’s tinkering with BattleTube settings from the way he’s touching the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Can you even do anything with settings?
 </p>
 <p>
  -?? Lol, there’s tons you can do. Super complicated.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yeah, if you look into options, there’s all sorts of stuff.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan fiddled with the settings with a serious expression,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh my. Boss, are you live?”
 </p>
 <p>
  From the penthouse’s private gym, sweaty Lee Hayeon and Lim Gayeong emerged.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  -Wow… did they just come from working out?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Woah, is Seong Jihan cohabiting with Lee Hayeon??
 </p>
 <p>
  -No, no, she comes to the penthouse for training. Saw it on Lim Gayeong’s broadcast.
 </p>
 <p>
  -?? Why train specifically at Seong Jihan’s place? The guild rents several floors.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Guess so… since they are dating.
 </p>
 <p>
  Amidst the viewers catching a bit of gossip,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hayeon, do you know how to navigate the BattleTube settings?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, yes. What are you looking for?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I need to conduct a vote but can’t find it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A vote?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan dropped a bombshell that quickly buried the gossip.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve acquired an evolutionary bonus, granting me +5 to basic stats. I thought I’d gather people’s opinions on what would be best to choose.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…You mean a +5 stat boost?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Choices are strength, agility, endurance, or mana.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Wow.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s words, their mouths fell open.
 </p>
 <p>
  An evolutionary bonus, +5 to stats?
 </p>
 <p>
  And now, he’s planning to decide through a BattleTube vote?
 </p>
 <p>
  -??
 </p>
 <p>
  -What did Seong Jihan just say?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Choice between strength, agility, endurance, or mana for +5…?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Didn’t he just bring something else from a special mission??
 </p>
 <p>
  -Lol, insane.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Boss… that evolutionary bonus, it’s not for your stats but for the whole race, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s correct.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “And you’re deciding this through a BattleTube vote?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Exactly. So, can you show me how?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh… that’s the thing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Blankly staring, Lee Hayeon proceeded to explain how to set up the vote.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, the chat was abuzz.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Definitely going for strength lol
 </p>
 <p>
  – No, no, pick agility; I wanna be faster.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Go with mana. Warriors have Seong Jihan, let’s make the mages stronger haha
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why not endurance? Not just players, but all people should benefit.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Right, Seong Jihan takes care of the gaming anyway, let’s focus on everyone’s health.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the four stats, endurance was distinctly the most popular.
 </p>
 <p>
  The most significant benefit for humanity as a whole, besides players, was undoubtedly from the endurance stat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, endurance is clearly leading. Should I just go with this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, Boss. Maybe give it a few hours… Ending such an important decision so quickly seems a bit…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so? Then let’s keep the live on for an hour. If you have a preferred stat, tell your friends to vote, please.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan said as he sat down.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll be enhancing my abilities for a bit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Enhancing abilities?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, I got something from a Constellation. In the inventory.”
 </p>
 <p>
  What Seong Jihan pulled out from the inventory was items gained while absorbing the Constellation’s spirits with the Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods.
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon retrieving a massive fang, the two instinctively stepped back.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Eek… Eek…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Miss, behind me!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The intense aura emanating from the Constellation’s fang made the two pale.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing their reaction, Seong Jihan swiftly absorbed the fang.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, sorry. Let me absorb it quickly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssshhhh…
 </p>
 <p>
  As he touched it, the fang disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Essence of the Sovereign activated, partially transferring the Constellation’s abilities to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your Martial Soul increases by 2.]
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed too little compared to the 5-point increase he used to get, but
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Good thing I collected ten.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Engrossed in activating the The Essence of the Sovereign, Seong Jihan planned to broadcast for just an hour.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, as he got absorbed in boosting his abilities, he ended up keeping the broadcast live. I
 </p>
 <p>
  t was only after a day that the vote concluded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Endurance really is the most popular.”
 </p>
 <p>
  And with the majority of humanity’s will inclined towards endurance,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan instantly activated the +5 to endurance effect.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Humanity’s evolutionary bonus has significantly accrued.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [As the representative of the species, do you wish to proceed with evolving into a lower species?]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A lower species?’
 </p>
 <p>
  A new message popped up.

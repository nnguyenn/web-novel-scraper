  Chapter 364
 </p>
 <p>
  The vote for humanity’s +5 stat boost, which lasted for 24 hours, concluded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the four options—strength, agility, mana, and endurance—over a billion votes chose endurance, resulting in a staggering approval rate of over 90%.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Endurance really is the best option.
 </p>
 <p>
  -It benefits ordinary people as well as players of all classes.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But wouldn’t +5 to mana allow those who can’t sense mana to start sensing it?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Even if you feel mana, without a gift, it’s useless lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, the World BattleNet Association held a meeting regarding this vote.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Choosing basic stats, that’s…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm, wouldn’t mana be better from a players’ strength perspective?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “However, the re-vote results show overwhelming support for endurance. Plus, it’s Seong Jihan we’re talking about; we can’t force our hand in this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, yes…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, being beyond the control of the World BattleNet Association and given the high support for endurance, led to the association deciding not to intervene in this matter.
 </p>
 <p>
  -He said he’d only open the vote for an hour…
 </p>
 <p>
  -He closed his eyes and seemed busy absorbing items; he’s on the 10th item now. Hasn’t moved from the sofa for 24 hours.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Didn’t eat or use the bathroom LOL
 </p>
 <p>
  -Supreme among superhumans, naturally.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan absorbed the 10 items, viewers closely followed the process. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  Once the process ended and Seong Jihan implemented the +5 to endurance as per the vote’s outcome, people truly felt the difference.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow! I really feel the increase in endurance!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Lol, stayed up all night to see the voting outcome, and suddenly I’m feeling super alert.
 </p>
 <p>
  -This +5 to endurance is really noticeable.
 </p>
 <p>
  -It’s just +5, but now I see why players are superhumans.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among all the evolutionary bonuses humanity received from Seong Jihan, the +5 to endurance had the best perceptible effect on the general population.
 </p>
 <p>
  News channels worldwide prominently featured this news, and experts debated on television about the societal changes that +5 to endurance could bring.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Doctor, how significant do you think the impact of +5 to endurance will be on humanity?
 </p>
 <p>
  =Aren’t you feeling it in real-time, anchor? The vitality surging through our bodies. When Seong Jihan previously acquired the vitality enhancement, it greatly impacted the medical industry, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  =This time, the impact on the entire medical industry might be even more significant. Last year, the cold incidence rate significantly dropped due to the vitality enhancement. And now, with this +5 to endurance, the effect might be even more substantial.
 </p>
 <p>
  While one channel hosted a panel discussion on the impacts of +5 to endurance,
 </p>
 <p>
  =Everyone, we just received breaking news.
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzz…
 </p>
 <p>
  The screen changed, and breaking news emerged again.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the footage,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Everyone, I have unexpected news.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, with a stoic expression, dropped a huge bombshell.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Humanity can now evolve into a lower-level species.”
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  -??
 </p>
 <p>
  -Race evolution??
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is it because of the +5 to endurance?
 </p>
 <p>
  -We’re finally moving up from being the lowest tier? LOL
 </p>
 <p>
  Race evolution.
 </p>
 <p>
  While humanity was considered the pinnacle of creation on Earth, in the Space League, they’ve always been told, “For a lowest-tier race…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The attention of all mankind was once again focused on Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  And it wasn’t just humans interested in this matter.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Race evolution… So, it’s actually possible?
 </p>
 <p>
  -It happens occasionally. Especially for a lowest-tier race like humanity, the evolution threshold isn’t high.
 </p>
 <p>
  -The guy above doesn’t know what he’s talking about. Lowest-tier races hardly ever receive evolution bonuses because they’re too weak. Only because this race got a player like Seong Jihan are they evolving.
 </p>
 <p>
  -That’s why I figured they’d evolve when they all got +1 affinity to all attributes. The human race must be pretty weak if even after getting that, they couldn’t evolve…
 </p>
 <p>
  Even aliens, who weren’t much interested in which stat humanity voted on, were actively discussing this.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But to evolve, there’s a prerequisite.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssssh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan brought up a screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, numerous items were listed within it.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Evolution Target Race: Humanity]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Evolution Difficulty: Very Hard]
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Initially set as ‘Very Hard’, numerous missions lined up beneath Humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Win a Space League competition match]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Reach Space Area – 6 or beyond]
 </p>
 <p>
  ……
 </p>
 <p>
  A total of 100 missions fitting the ‘Very Hard’ difficulty.
 </p>
 <p>
  Most of them had a clear sign next to them.
 </p>
 <p>
  -It says ‘Very Hard’, but everything’s cleared?
 </p>
 <p>
  -…Most of them were cleared by Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  -LOL, riding the Seong Jihan bus to evolution.
 </p>
 <p>
  -How many levels have humanity upped because of him this past year? LOL
 </p>
 <p>
  -At this point, the whole world should erect statues of him.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Surprisingly, there are already statues in some countries.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Really??
 </p>
 <p>
  -He became a god in some low-tier nations after figuring out how to remove dungeon portals LOL.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan had cleared most of the missions, there were still a few he hadn’t.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Achieve a win rate of over 60% against the lowest-tier races in the Bronze League evolution area for 7 days]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Achieve a win rate of over 60% against the lowest-tier races in the Silver League evolution area for 7 days]
 </p>
 <p>
  ……
 </p>
 <p>
  Missions like these set from Bronze to Diamond, requiring a 60% win rate achievement over a week.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was a mission Seong Jihan wanted to clear but couldn’t.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was already part of the Grand Master League.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Mission?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Given the bonuses humanity has received so far, they could probably evolve straight away. Why take on a mission?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is it because there’s too much dependence on one player?
 </p>
 <p>
  -What’s an evolution area?
 </p>
 <p>
  -It appears… this is a place temporarily assigned to the TOP 100 players from each league. This is new to me too.
 </p>
 <p>
  An evolution area temporarily set up for race evolution missions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here, races trying to move up from lowest-tier to lower-tier like humanity would compete against each other for a week.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is the real problem.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A 60% win rate.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although it was an easy condition for a monster player like Seong Jihan,
 </p>
 <p>
  If players competing for evolution came together to be judged on win rate, this condition wasn’t as easy as it seemed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially from Bronze to Diamond league, meeting this condition proved problematic for everyone.
 </p>
 <p>
  “95 missions are cleared, but those 5 are troublesome. A 60% win rate… Although TOP 100 from each league will compete, it won’t be easy. We’ll need close cooperation from the Association.”
 </p>
 <p>
  -It’d be so unfair to lose the evolution because of these 5 missions 🙁
 </p>
 <p>
  -Humanity has benefited so much up to now; they should at least be able to do this much, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  -If they can’t even do this much, that’s the problem…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Usually, getting a 55% win rate accumulates experience for promotion to the next league in BattleNet… A 60% win rate is seriously ruthless;
 </p>
 <p>
  -But if they group all the lowest-tiers together, shouldn’t it be manageable?
 </p>
 <p>
  Only 5 missions remain.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, these were the biggest obstacle for humanity, constantly riding the Seong Jihan bus.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially the 60% win rate condition, which seemed excessively challenging even for ‘Very Hard’ difficulty.
 </p>
 <p>
  People couldn’t hide their anxiety about whether or not this was achievable.
 </p>
 <p>
  And.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘60% is too high of a hurdle.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, looking at the missions, made a cold judgement.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gathering only the lowest-tier, it might be somewhat easier compared to competing against alien races.
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  However, still, making a league game just for TOP 100 from the same lowest-tier race.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was hard for one race to achieve over a 60% win rate.
 </p>
 <p>
  All five leagues, achieving over 60% was practically impossible.
 </p>
 <p>
  To clear this…
 </p>
 <p>
  “President Jeff, could you give me a call? We need to discuss some coordination for this mission.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as Seong Jihan expected President Jeff to see this and spoke up,
 </p>
 <p>
  Brrrrr…
 </p>
 <p>
  His phone immediately vibrated.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Seong Jihan! I saw the broadcast. What, what can we do to assist?]
 </p>
 <p>
  President Jeff’s voice was excited.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

 <p>
  If Seong Jihan was asking, he was ready to provide whatever support was needed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Gather all the players who make it to the TOP 100… That’ll be 500 people, right? Bring them all to the Korean BattleNet Center.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ah, not New York but Korea…]
 </p>
 <p>
  From Bronze to Diamond, many among the TOP 100 players had adopted U.S. nationality and had joined American guilds.
 </p>
 <p>
  Naturally, the U.S. provided the best treatment compared to other countries.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, considering the number of people, it would’ve been better if Seong Jihan went to the U.S.
 </p>
 <p>
  “New York is a bit far for me to go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ah, of course! It should be us going, absolutely! Understood! We’ll begin gathering everyone immediately!]
 </p>
 <p>
  At his word, President Jeff immediately agreed.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the current era, it was natural for 500 people to cross over to Korea rather than one person, Seong Jihan, to head to New York.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, humanity, more urgently than ever, began mobilizing to clear the evolution mission.
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  [+5 to endurance, the most perceptible racial bonus so far]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Humanity enters race evolution: What changes upon becoming a lower-tier species?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Korean BattleNet Center, under expansion with investments from the World BattleNet Federation. The first phase includes bringing in 500 BattleNet connectors]
 </p>
 <p>
  [60% win rate, is it realistically achievable? Experts diagnose that it would be difficult without a special method]
 </p>
 <p>
  “60% win rate… that’s literally setting a condition not to evolve.”
 </p>
 <p>
  While sipping coffee, Yoon Sejin shook his head at the news titles.
 </p>
 <p>
  From Bronze to Diamond, maintaining a 60% win rate over a week was too demanding.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the other side of the dining table, hearing this, Yoon Seah tilted her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But if it fails this time, can’t we just try again later? Honestly, without uncle, even the other conditions would have been challenging. Is there a time limit on the mission?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s no time limit. But if you look closely at the conditions, the evolution area only opens once a year.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A year… that is a long wait.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Missing this opportunity means having to try again a year later.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I hope it works out this time… Uncle, do you have a plan?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I do have a plan of sorts. But it would cost me quite a bit to go through with it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The method Seong Jihan considered was activating the Constellation Traits.
 </p>
 <p>
  The increased domain of 2,000 from the Sole Sovereignty trait meant it was feasible to sponsor all the players participating this time.
 </p>
 <p>
  That would likely provide them an advantage through Constellation sponsorship.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Then the Constellation’s reaching level would drop.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The level drop experienced every time the Constellation trait is activated.
 </p>
 <p>
  It had already decreased from 777 to 767.
 </p>
 <p>
  A further drop would make it easier to become a constellation, but without the protection as a candidate from the system, it was in Seong Jihan’s interest to keep this level as high as possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Becoming a lower-tier species, I’m not sure how much stronger that would make me, it’s hard to feel the real benefit.’
 </p>
 <p>
  While the +5 to endurance, praised by everyone for its noticeable effect, didn’t make much difference to Seong Jihan, who already had a substantial Martial Soul stat.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even evolving into a lower-tier species, for Seong Jihan, who could already defeat even the highest-tier species, the benefits of this were still unknown.
 </p>
 <p>
  While pondering how much level to invest in this,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just don’t do it, then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Hearing it could be a loss for him, Yoon Seah immediately shook her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle has done so much up to now; why should he have to take a loss for humanity to evolve? It’d be better to take our time and clear the missions over a few years.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right, Jihan. Don’t push it. Even if we become a lower-tier species, what big change is expected? I didn’t dramatically feel the difference with +5 to endurance… For a powerful being like Jihan, even if our race evolves, it’ll be the same.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Yoon Sejin joined in advising not to sacrifice himself,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssshh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The Shadow Queen appeared from Seong Jihan’s arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No. Unlike adding stats, evolving a race’s grade can be quite effective.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh.… Really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. While it’s okay to take it slow if the loss is too great… race evolution can significantly benefit even the powerful. The stronger the being, the bigger the gain.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm. Is that so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  If that’s the case, to what extent is investing in the Constellation’s reaching level worthwhile?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan calmly weighed the pros and cons and mumbled,
 </p>
 <p>
  “To do this properly, I’d need Constellation Fame.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If he was going to use the Sole Sovereignty trait, it would be best to strengthen it first for the best effect.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan thought of ways to accumulate fame,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Constellation Fame? Then work on achievements.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Achievements?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Humanity’s strength is in numbers, isn’t it? Especially now, with race evolution at stake, they have to comply with your requests.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so? I thought I had cleared most of them. What achievements are there?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “First off…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Shadow Queen began explaining the process for achievements.

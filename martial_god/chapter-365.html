 <p>
  Chapter 365
 </p>
 <p>
  “You know achievement points can be converted into Constellation Fame, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, I’m aware.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course. Achievement points, which have been useless until now, finally have a purpose, so it’s hard not to know.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s lips curled slightly at the Shadow Queen’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  Achievement points, deemed useless even by a high-standing Constellation like the Shadow Queen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, he had been efficiently using them since level 2, growing all the way to this point.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It seems even players who’ve reached Constellation status don’t know about the achievement store.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Though the reason for the achievement store’s emergence after his regression remains unknown.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nevertheless, Seong Jihan thought it best to take the knowledge of the store to the grave, waiting eagerly for her next words.
 </p>
 <p>
  “With your accomplishments, you’ve likely cleared almost every achievement in the game. Climbing to a Constellation candidate is no easy feat.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “True. I’ve earned quite a bit from them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But. How about these?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzz…
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, the Shadow Queen brought up the achievement entries.
 </p>
 <p>
  [General Achievement, ‘Even if the World Hates You. (10)’]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Achieve by collecting 1 billion dislikes on a BattleTube video.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Special Achievement, ‘Little By Little Makes A Lot (10)’]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Achieve by receiving 1GP donations 1 billion times on a BattleTube video.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are these?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Achievements you haven’t broken yet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan scrutinized the achievement entries the Shadow Queen displayed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Achievements related to collecting dislikes or 1GP donations.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve earned up to level 6 for the dislike achievement.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But you couldn’t have done the next stages. Not to mention collecting a billion dislikes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well… that’s true.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan slowly nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had managed to clear up to the 6th level of the dislike achievement during inter-country competitions when friction with other countries led their viewers to systematically terrorize his videos.
 </p>
 <p>
  But surpassing the 7th level threshold wasn’t easy.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Constellation candidates mostly become heroes of their races. Players who rise to candidates must boast an unparalleled presence within their race. The species entwined in BattleNet have no choice but to rely on them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right! Lately, only aliens have been leaving hate comments on uncle’s channel.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How could they dislike him when he has contributed so much to humanity? Honestly, uncle single-handedly pushed through the race evolution this time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Becoming part of the Space League.
 </p>
 <p>
  With and without Seong Jihan, the win rate difference was so significant that pressing dislike on him was unthinkable for humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially since people who benefitted from perks like vitality enhancement included patients cured of fatal diseases, some who disparaged Seong Jihan online faced lynching in reality.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right. Currently, you are a hero to humanity. Thus, you’ll never be able to clear negative achievements. Who would dare to mockingly donate 1GP to you or press dislike a billion times?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems naturally tough. So, are we using this opportunity to massively clear such achievements?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right. If we gather all these, the Constellation Fame… we might even amass up to 100,000. Though the Shadow Elves couldn’t gather a billion dislikes due to population limitations, humanity has a large population capable of using BattleTube.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Constellation Fame 100,000?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s eyes widened at the thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  Could these achievements really yield that many points?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even if I clear level 10, it collects up to 100,000?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There are more, like getting liked then unliked, losing a billion subscribers in a day, etc., all sorts of achievements.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ho…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssshh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The Shadow Queen then showed him a series of seemingly negative or pointless BattleTube-related achievements.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s eyes lit up as he saw them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Constellation Fame, to think it could be amassed so easily…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Since it’s related to race evolution, humanity will definitely cooperate. Let’s mobilize everyone this time to smash through them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded to the Shadow Queen’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to other species, humanity’s numerical advantage.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was the perfect time to utilize it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright. Let’s get started then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan turned on BattleTube.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  [Preparing for humanity’s evolution involves numbers of dislikes on Seong Jihan’s channel?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [A global effort in achievement hunting. Achievement points, re-evaluated for their worth.]

 <p>
  [With TOP 100 players arriving at the Seoul BattleNet Center, burning with determination to achieve a 60% win rate.]
 </p>
 <p>
  While the TOP 100 players selected from each league gathered in Seoul for the evolution mission,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan focused on breaking the achievement entries informed by the Shadow Queen.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Never thought I’d be disliking Seong Jihan’s channel in my life…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is it true that dislikes hit 3 billion? LOL
 </p>
 <p>
  -Unsubscribing also went crazy; tens of billions turned into a mere million overnight;
 </p>
 <p>
  -With evolution at stake, people really listen haha
 </p>
 <p>
  -Up until now, Seong Jihan’s channel had too high a minimum donation rate… finally managed to donate even 1GP.
 </p>
 <p>
  -There really is an achievement for everything on BattleTube LOL
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps because the evolution from the lowest-tier to a lower-tier species was on the line, all 6 billion of humanity united their hearts and minds, faithfully fulfilling the achievement items as instructed by the Shadow Queen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Observing Seong Jihan clearing BattleTube achievements (10) all the way, alien races were flabbergasted.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Whoa… even a lowest-tier species has its uses. To break those achievements up to level 10.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Gathering a billion dislikes all at once is shocking… did that species have such a large population?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Most lowest-tier species are numerous. That’s their only merit.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But already amassing Constellation Fame for what? He’s still a candidate.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Well, it’s not the first strange thing about him…
 </p>
 <p>
  Through the voluntary cooperation of humanity, Seong Jihan blitzed through all the achievements.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How about it? Earned some fame?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. So far, this has been the most useful tip.”Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  He smiled even more profoundly than usual at the Shadow Queen’s question.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Constellation Fame… I’ve amassed far more than just 100,000.’
 </p>
 <p>
  From clearing the epic quest in the Graveyard of Stars, he had gained 100,000 Constellation Fame.
 </p>
 <p>
  Combining that with the achievement farming, his current amount of Constellation Fame was substantial.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Time to upgrade everything in the Constellation shop.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan opened the Constellation shop and upgraded all items available for level up.
 </p>
 <p>
  First off, he upgraded the shop itself, followed by ‘Dominion’ and ‘Sole Sovereignty’.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dominion trait upgraded to LV.2. Efficiency of the ‘Dominion’ trait increases.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Sole Sovereignty trait upgraded to LV.2. Efficiency of the ‘Sole Sovereignty’ trait increases.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan beamed at the message.
 </p>
 <p>
  Right now, with Constellation Traits OFF, upgrading the two traits didn’t significantly impact him.
 </p>
 <p>
  But activating it would make the effects remarkably noticeable.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Still have points left.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He used the remaining points to upgrade all sub-items in the LV.2 upgraded Constellation shop.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  After thoroughly utilizing the points earned from achievement farming, the results were:
 </p>
 <p>
  [Constellation Shop LV.2]
 </p>
 <p>
  Upgrade Constellation Shop – 100000P
 </p>
 <p>
  Dominion LV.3 – 200000P
 </p>
 <p>
  Sole Sovereignty LV.3 – 200000P
 </p>
 <p>
  Trait Enhancement LV.3 – 100000P
 </p>
 <p>
  Sponsor Slot Expansion LV.3 – 50000P
 </p>
 <p>
  Special Sponsor Item Creation – 500P
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, the Constellation shop was ready for the next level upgrade.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Looks like I have to start gathering points again.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The joy of the overall upgrade of the Constellation shop was brief as Seong Jihan saw the requirement of 200,000 fame for level 3 upgrades and frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  The requirement for LV.2 was 100,000…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Surely it doesn’t double every time, does it?’
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan pondered over the Constellation shop items and frowned,
 </p>
 <p>
  Brrrrr…
 </p>
 <p>
  A call came from Jeff, the President of the World BattleNet Association.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Seong Jihan! All the TOP 100 players have arrived!]
 </p>
 <p>
  President Jeff, who came to the Korean BattleNet Center personally to have a part in humanity’s evolution, was actively working to ensure that the 500 players could smoothly play BattleNet in Korea.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, let’s go then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Receiving the call, Seong Jihan headed to the Korean BattleNet Center.
 </p>
 <p>
  He met the 500 players gathered in the center’s auditorium.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Many familiar faces in the Diamond League.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Diamond TOP 100.
 </p>
 <p>
  Most of these players were part of the human representative team, including Yoon Sejin and Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh! Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, waving at Seong Jihan as he stepped onto the stage, seemed glad to see him.
 </p>

 <p>
  He gave a short laugh at this, then swiftly moved onto the main agenda.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Those among you with a Constellation, please step aside for a moment. This includes those sponsored by me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Following Seong Jihan’s instructions, people began moving after sharing glances.
 </p>
 <p>
  Many from the Diamond league, having acquired quite a few sponsoring Constellations, moved, but most from Platinum and below stayed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Being a lowest-tier must be why, not until Diamond do they get sponsored by alien Constellations.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought this while counting the remaining players.
 </p>
 <p>
  389.
 </p>
 <p>
  Out of the TOP 100 humanity players, only 111 were sponsored by a Constellation.
 </p>
 <p>
  With so many unsponsored, achieving a 60% win rate across all leagues wouldn’t be easy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan faced the group and spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The rest of you will receive Constellation sponsorship from me for this week.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sponsorship?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan sir, didn’t you already sponsor everyone…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Murmur. Murmur.
 </p>
 <p>
  The players shared bewildered looks at Seong Jihan’s statement.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Correct. Normally, there’s a limit to sponsorship. However,”
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching them, Seong Jihan pulled out his prepared speech.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You all participated in the mission to hit dislike, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “With the Constellation Fame earned through it, I’ve temporarily gained the ability to mimic a Constellation’s power. The number of people I can sponsor has also increased momentarily.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Not needing to delve into the details about Constellation trait ON.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan explained that he could momentarily wield a Constellation’s power thanks to the recently acquired Constellation Fame and outlined the future plan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll start sponsoring right before the matching begins on the first day.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A 60% win rate.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan knew how challenging this would be, given humanity’s racial limitation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Starting off strong from the first day was essential for managing the win rate more comfortably.
 </p>
 <p>
  “And once we’re evenly matched and most players are linked in the game… I’ll unleash the Constellation powers.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you unleash the Constellation powers then…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your abilities will significantly increase, like receiving a buff.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ooh…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sounds manageable then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  People’s eyes sparkled at his words.
 </p>
 <p>
  With Seong Jihan backing them up, achieving a 60% win rate seemed easy.
 </p>
 <p>
  As people optimistically thought so,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssshh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan stretched out all ten fingers.
 </p>
 <p>
  “However, this power unleash has a time limit of 10 minutes. We have to finish the games as quickly as possible.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… 10 minutes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, he’s still a candidate, after all, restrictions like that make sense.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “10 minutes is generous.”
 </p>
 <p>
  People thought it natural for there to be limits to using the power, not being a Constellation themselves. However, the inside story was different.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can only drop the Constellation reaching level twice a day.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The drop in Constellation reaching level occurring every five minutes while the Constellation trait is ON.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan planned not to drop his level more than twice a day.
 </p>
 <p>
  Setting this limit would surely motivate players to actively participate in the games.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, I’ll enter the sponsorship mode right before today’s matching starts.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, Seong Jihan turned on the Constellation Traits.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your Constellation reaching level decreases to 766.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Immediately, a message popped up.
 </p>
 <p>
  In five more minutes, the level would drop again.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Better hurry then.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan swiftly processed the sponsorship for the 389 individuals.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sponsorship progressed at lightning speed, from Bronze through to Platinum.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow… didn’t expect Seong Jihan to become my Constellation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you so much!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The sponsorship, processed in the blink of an eye,
 </p>
 <p>
  [This player already has a sponsoring Constellation.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon sponsoring the Diamond players, suddenly a message popped up declaring the existence of a Constellation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What…? But I don’t have a Constellation?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Diamond player, bewildered at the message, waved hands in denial, but then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [A hidden Constellation, ‘The King of Humans,’ reveals itself.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As another message appeared, the previously perplexed expression swiftly changed to a relaxed one.

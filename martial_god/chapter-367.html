 <p>
  Chapter 367
 </p>
 <p>
  In the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams Formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Next to the World Tree, at the lakeside where Kang Sang was fishing, he turned his head towards Seong Jihan’s direction.
 </p>
 <p>
  “A guest has arrived…”CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  An old man, carrying a bamboo fishing rod on his shoulder, slowly walked towards Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  He then slowly opened his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who might you be?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t you remember?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Remember? We’re meeting for the first time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kang Sang blinked, looking at Seong Jihan as if he saw something strange.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed he had no recollection of the prolonged battle they had in the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams Formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It seems like a reset happens when re-entry occurs.’
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s fortunate.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing Kang Sang only observing him without entering into battle immediately, Seong Jihan absorbed life energy from the World Tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your ‘Eternity’ stat increases by 1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Eternity stat grows rapidly just by being near the World Tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan absorbed the life energy, Kang Sang narrowed his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “To absorb the life energy from that monstrous tree… You must be related to that abomination…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Monstrous tree? Are you referring to that tree?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Before engaging in battle and hoping to absorb enough life energy, Seong Jihan, pretending not to know, initiated a conversation.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Kang Sang immediately saw through his intent.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Trying to buy time, I see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whirr!
 </p>
 <p>
  The fishing line wrapped around the bamboo rod, which then transformed into a bamboo staff in Kang Sang’s hand, becoming a weapon.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I needed to absorb more life energy, what a shame.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Facing Kang Sang who seemed ready to charge, Seong Jihan summoned Eclipse in his left hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ho… Alright, let’s see what you’ve got!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The staff, stretched out in a straight line towards him.
 </p>
 <p>
  To Seong Jihan, this attack was familiar.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He always started with this move.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Kang Sang’s initial attack seen countless times during simulations in the Void Training Room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan easily dodged it and went straight into a counterattack.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sword and staff crossed paths.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  A violent explosion rocked the world as their weapons met.
 </p>
 <p>
  This initiated a series of clashes between the sword and staff.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm, you’re strong…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Click.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the fierce confrontation, it was Kang Sang who first took a step back.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who was superior in strength from the start, had grown accustomed to Kang Sang’s attacks through endless simulations in the Void Training Room.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was only natural for him to have the upper hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Compared to the simulation, Kang Sang has definitely shown noticeable growth.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to the simulation of Kang Sang in the training room.
 </p>
 <p>
  The current opponent was indeed showing remarkable growth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is interesting…”
 </p>
 <p>
  An elder burning with fighting spirit, looking at the stronger opponent, Seong Jihan, with sparkling eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Crimson Divinity that Kang Sang was practicing had grown at an unbelievable pace since their first encounter.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘In the Void Training Room, when strength was set equally, it was fifty-fifty, but here, that would lead to defeat.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought about testing his strength against Kang Sang, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…No. First, I need to remove the Constellation’s command from Gilgamesh.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He decided to set aside his desire for competition and focused on the priorities at hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he was expelled again, he wouldn’t be able to re-enter for another two weeks.
 </p>
 <p>
  Given the situation, it wasn’t practical to engage leisurely in battle with Kang Sang.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your ‘Eternity’ stat increases by 1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, despite the ongoing battle, the Eternity stat continued to grow robustly.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have gained 5 Eternity from the ‘Sealed Fragment of the World Tree-1’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You cannot gain more Eternity from this location.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether the previous gain of +3 was counted or not, after gaining 5 Eternity from the sealed World Tree, a message appeared indicating no further increase in Eternity was possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though the life energy from the World Tree continued to be absorbed, the Eternity within Seong Jihan no longer grew.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It won’t let me freely harvest its benefits.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan clicked his tongue in frustration.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed unlikely he would be able to complete the latter part of the domination code.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Considering the name, ‘Sealed Fragment of the World Tree-1’, there must be 2 and 3. Perhaps in those, I can gain more Eternity.’
 </p>
 <p>
  And to access fragments 2 or 3, he must first defeat the opponent in front of him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s finish this.’
 </p>

 <p>
  Seong Jihan unleashed his power to subdue Kang Sang.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack…!
 </p>
 <p>
  As Eclipse collided with the staff, it began to crack.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing this, Kang Sang’s expression grew serious.
 </p>
 <p>
  The opponent before him, was too strong of an adversary to overcome.
 </p>
 <p>
  “With my current limitations, I’m no match for you. Normally, I’d gladly risk my life to learn from such a strong opponent as yourself…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kang Sang gazed at the World Tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If the giant awakens, it would be a disaster for humanity… I have a duty to protect the seal.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With those words, the bamboo staff he held began to soften and transformed into a whip.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just like the last time Seong Jihan was expelled from the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams using the sealing formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was once again manifesting, moving through the air like a snake.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whirl!
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, the technique that could shatter worlds and forcibly expel opponents was unleashed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What appears is but a distraction…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Plunk!
 </p>
 <p>
  The shadow sword Eclipse sliced through not the dazzling movements of the whip but the air itself.
 </p>
 <p>
  And with that, the movements of the sealing formation faltered significantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It was the flow of energy slicing through the atmosphere that’s real.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In the Void Training Room, Seong Jihan could never fully counter the sealing formation. When Kang Sang employed it, it seemed challenging to deal with.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, once faced with it again, Seong Jihan immediately deciphered the hidden movements of the sealing formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was possible because,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sealing formation… It’s related to the Taiji Swordsmanship.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The experiences with the Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods and acquiring the Taiji Swordsmanship played a significant role.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sealing formation that Kang Sang used contained some complex essence of the Taiji Swordsmanship.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though Seong Jihan had only mimicked using the Taiji Swordsmanship as a skill once, that experience enabled him to understand the movements of the sealing formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  And when Seong Jihan mentioned the Taiji Swordsmanship,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Taiji Swordsmanship…? How do you know of it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kang Sang’s eyes widened in surprise.
 </p>
 <p>
  “To obliterate souls, it was a thought I had entertained…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Obliterate souls.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Was he aiming to eliminate the soul of the giant?
 </p>
 <p>
  Kang Sang had been contemplating the Taiji Swordsmanship since his days.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have some knowledge.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan responded and mobilized Eclipse.
 </p>
 <p>
  A momentary flicker of shadow, and then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Fundamental Divine Art,
 </p>
 <p>
  Triad of Martial Mastery:
 </p>
 <p>
  Total Annihilation Horizontal Sweep
 </p>
 <p>
  The world seemed to split in two.
 </p>
 <p>
  Total Annihilation Horizontal Sweep.
 </p>
 <p>
  A simple technique that cuts across, but to Kang Sang, who had his sealing formation obstructed, there was no power left to counter.
 </p>
 <p>
  Plunk!
 </p>
 <p>
  The white beard was cut in half and fell to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kang Sang then looked down.
 </p>
 <p>
  “All the effort I put into grooming it… cut down so undignified.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “My apologies.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Drip. Drip.
 </p>
 <p>
  Beyond the severed beard,
 </p>
 <p>
  a deep cut across his chest bled profusely.
 </p>
 <p>
  Along with that, the bamboo staff reverted to its original form.
 </p>
 <p>
  The formidable aura of Kang Sang now faded.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do not proceed any further. The existence of Neijin must never be exposed to the world…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [PR/N: Neijin/ Neigong are the same, it’s qi or life force.]
 </p>
 <p>
  With those final words, Kang Sang’s upper body slumped.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud….
 </p>
 <p>
  He fell to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  And above him, a system message emerged.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The external formation of Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams has collapsed, releasing the Nine Palaces, Eight Trigrams.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘The Sealed Fragment of the World Tree-1’ will be released outside the seal.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s coming out?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned at the message.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sealed World Tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  It played a continuous role in resurrecting Kang Sang’s “giant,” referred to as the target and blood clan.
 </p>
 <p>
  The persistent soul of the giant within the Symbol of Taiji remained even in fragments.
 </p>
 <p>
  Their will to survive was incredibly strong and formidable.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If the other fragments of the World Tree are released, will they resurrect too?’
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  That would bring disaster to a peaceful world.
 </p>
 <p>
  Coming to raise the Eternity stat but ending up with a bigger issue seems to be the case.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Would you like to enter Neijin?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzz…
 </p>
 <p>
  A pattern materialized next to the World Tree, somewhat resembling the formation of Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods at first glance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Entering through it would presumably lead to Neijin.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the World Tree, which was exuding more life energy, seemingly aware of its imminent release, stronger than before.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before entering Neijin, dealing with it seemed necessary.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Should I use the destruction code?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan first attempted to write the destruction code on the tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Instantly, the World Tree was erased from the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed, the Destruction code was unstoppable, even against the World Tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  But,
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s futile…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as Kang Sang finished speaking from behind him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  From where the World Tree stood, a faint smoke rose,
 </p>
 <p>
  and the tree began to regenerate.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why do you think I haven’t tried destroying it? No matter how many times it was torn down, that monstrosity would always regenerate…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re still alive?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. That tree exuded so much life energy that it kept me barely alive for a while. Once the sealing formation is completely destroyed, I too will vanish.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The sealing formation…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan glanced around.
 </p>
 <p>
  The lush green world by the lakeside.
 </p>
 <p>
  From the edge of the world, it began to transform into a view from beneath the sea.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is the sealing formation going to completely collapse once the sea water from the edge enters here…?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The world was rapidly disintegrating.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before the world fully changed, there seemed to be an urgency to deal with the tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If the soul cannot be obliterated, that monstrosity cannot be removed…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Obliteration of souls… Can it be done?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s possible, perhaps…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, it must be attempted.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The power of obliteration.
 </p>
 <p>
  That was what Kang Sang had mentioned just moments ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Taiji Swordsmanship,’ he said, considering it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan used a skill.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Taiji Swordsmanship.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon calling out the skill name, a Taiji symbol emerged behind Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  It continued to expand endlessly.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, is this supposed to be the Taiji Swordsmanship…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Indeed, it is.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… No, this isn’t right…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Observing the endlessly expanding Taiji, Kang Sang, bisected and lying on the ground, began to provide guidance.
 </p>
 <p>
  “When will you stop expanding the Taiji? Can’t you control your own power?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The essence of the Taiji Swordsmanship is in the Swordsmanship itself. Currently, you only display the flow of yin and yang.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… This is strange. Very strange. You’re completely unable to control the power. How did you unleash it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  How did he unleash it?
 </p>
 <p>
  He used a skill.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan slightly frowned at Kang Sang’s nitpicking on the Taiji phase from behind, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Try this instead…”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Kang Sang began to instruct, Seong Jihan’s expression turned serious.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘To receive guidance on using the Taiji Swordsmanship from its creator.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Coming to increase the Eternity stat but ending up with such an unexpected gain.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I understand. I’ll follow your guidance.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan respectfully responded and began to manipulate the Taiji Swordsmanship according to Kang Sang’s directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile,
 </p>
 <p>
  At the Star of the Martial Gods, in Tuseong,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak, who was monitoring Gilgamesh, suddenly choked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s the matter?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite Gilgamesh’s question, Dongbang Sak, looking into the void and stroking his beard,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  silently muttered,
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s nothing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Saying so, Dongbang Sak unconsciously stroked the middle of his beard.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Nothing, indeed.”

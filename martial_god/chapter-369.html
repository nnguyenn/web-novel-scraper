  Chapter 369
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan reflected on the evolution mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Achieve a win rate of over 60% in the Bronze League’s evolution area for seven days against the lowest-tier species.]
 </p>
 <p>
  From the Bronze to Diamond league, the condition was to achieve over 60% win rate for seven days.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having already reached 70% by the sixth day, even a lower win rate on the last day should still overall exceed 60%.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Gilgamesh really helped a bit there.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He managed a free ride without almost reducing his Constellation reach level.
 </p>
 <p>
  Always driving the bus, it felt quite pleasant to finally ride it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, he can’t let him drive until the end.
 </p>
 <p>
  Who knows what he might do.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘At the end, I’ll remove the Constellation’s Command and activate the Constellation traits.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought this and asked Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s been no change to the Constellation’s Command yet, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Um, not yet…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah looked around briefly and then whispered to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s weird, some people have started to like the king of humans.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Like the king?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah… The ‘King of Humans’ is a Constellation that caused a penalty of -3 to all stats for the TOP 100. But strangely, there are more people speaking positively about him. On the first day, they were all cursing him.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As expected, that guy wouldn’t just sit idly by.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  Top rankers for whom every stat is crucial.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was unimaginable that they would like Gilgamesh after receiving a crazy penalty of -3 to all stats.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet suddenly, on the sixth day, such public opinion was forming.
 </p>
 <p>
  There must be some manipulation from Gilgamesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not everyone has arrived yet, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked around and spoke to the BattleNet center staff.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, it’s still early morning so many players are still asleep.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please let them know I am here, and gather everyone in the auditorium. It’s time to retract the Constellation’s command.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, got it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The staff moved quickly upon Seong Jihan’s instructions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, can you really remove the Constellation’s command?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s try it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan reflected on the Eternity within him.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Eternity, which jumped to 14 as the World Tree fragment was destroyed, was quietly confronting Void.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though usually, these energies would clash fiercely and cause a massive explosion,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is it because of the development over time, or because I handled the Taiji Swordsmanship… I can control the two energies better than I worried.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan found himself better able to prevent their collision than when his Eternity was at 2.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘At this rate, it’s okay for Eternity to grow a bit more.’Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking this, Seong Jihan headed to the auditorium first.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon after,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He really came!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was nervous since it’s the last day…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a relief.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In the BattleNet center’s auditorium, 500 players began to gather hurriedly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks to the Constellation’s Command ‘Sacrifice the lesser for the greater’, they had successfully carried out the evolution mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, they were all worried about the impending ‘lesser’ sacrifice.
 </p>
 <p>
  All stats -3.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although seemingly a small penalty, it was a significant deduction for those competing at the top of each league.
 </p>
 <p>
  But since Seong Jihan said he could solve it, it was natural there was a light in their faces.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I apologize for being late in finding a way to retract the Constellation’s command.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Finally!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re going to… retract the Constellation’s command…”
 </p>
 <p>
  While most people were delighted at Seong Jihan’s words, a few had an odd expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  People appearing indifferent despite the removal of the all stats -3.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Are these the ones Seah mentioned with weird reactions?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan remembered the faces of these individuals as he began to work.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let us express gratitude to Gilgamesh, who has relieved me so far.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Chiiiik…!
 </p>

 <p>
  Letters began to be etched in the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  The domination code, which originally wasn’t fully written due to a lack of life energy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, with the explosive growth of the Eternity stat, was smoothly being written to completion.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, no…! My king, only he!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We must remain loyal…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Somehow brainwashed by the Constellation’s command.
 </p>
 <p>
  The players who had shown odd reactions earlier began to convulse.
 </p>
 <p>
  But resistance was brief.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Their eyes lost focus.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clack. Clack.
 </p>
 <p>
  They knelt in unison towards Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  And this attitude wasn’t just confined to them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Those who hadn’t resisted not only knelt but also prostrated themselves to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  As if reacting to the presence of an emperor or a deity.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the domination code completed, these people became thoroughly subservient to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Including ordinary players and even the staff nearby in the auditorium.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The domination code has been activated, removing the former Constellation’s command.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Would you like to dominate them in his stead?]
 </p>
 <p>
  And soon, a message appeared before Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  An offer to become a ruler in place of Gilgamesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan saw Yoon Seah and others kneeling and prostrating themselves.
 </p>
 <p>
  With just the completed domination code.
 </p>
 <p>
  Could he become a deity-like entity among humanity?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Not really to my taste. Rather, it’s displeasing.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He had no desire to become a ruler in the first place, much less to dominate in a way that seemed like brainwashing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan withdrew the domination code, saying,
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, I will not dominate.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As he refused,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What, what’s happening?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  People regained their senses and slowly began to stand up, looking at each other.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s done. Please check.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Following Seong Jihan’s words, players who checked their status screens exclaimed,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Whoa. It’s really gone…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So the all stats -3 isn’t a worry anymore?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We really just made great use of the King of Humans’ buff!”
 </p>
 <p>
  They were jubilant as they saw the effect of the Constellation’s Command buff disappear.
 </p>
 <p>
  This held true even for those who first showed strange reactions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s enter today’s game. I’ll compensate for the loss of the buff effect by activating my Constellation powers.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Players, their morale significantly boosted, moved towards the BattleNet connector room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thus decided to finally activate Constellation mode on the last day.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  On the last day of humanity’s evolution mission, Day 7 of the event.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah…! What happened? Players aren’t showing the same regenerative powers as before!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Just in, news has come in that the Constellation’s Command has been removed by Seong Jihan!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Does this mean they no longer have to ‘sacrifice the lesser for the greater’? Ah. But this means the 70% win rate over the past six days will be broken!
 </p>
 <p>
  =That’s a pity. So, the overall win rate still combines above 60%, right? Even if today they score 0%, it will probably still exceed 60%…
 </p>
 <p>
  Channel 0 commentators noted the gameplay situation as they realized that the Constellation’s Command buff had disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  -OMG, why did they cancel Lord Gilgamesh’s command? booooo. What if the win rate falls below 60% now.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Can’t afford the stats –3 reduction either, lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  -My stats aren’t the ones being reduced, what’s the big deal?? Humanity’s evolution is what’s more important!!
 </p>
 <p>
  -Seriously thinking this… -3 on four stats means like losing 12 levels….
 </p>
 <p>
  -Evolution will cover up whatever losses lolol.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Anyway, calculations say it’s over 60% combined, right? Even 50% today would suffice.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Constellation’s Command disappeared, many viewers felt disappointed, worried they might not maintain the win rate.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Constellation reach level drops to 765.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan decisively activated the Constellation traits, the battle became manageable.
 </p>
 <p>
  -O, they are fighting better than expected?
 </p>

 <p>
  -Seong Jihan substituted with a buff from his Constellation powers.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But isn’t Seong Jihan still just a Constellation candidate? He really does it all;
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yo, looks like it’s gonna exceed 60% today too?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Lol, Yoon Seah has revived. Humanity’s victory in matches seems guaranteed now.
 </p>
 <p>
  While they couldn’t maintain the regenerative powers like Gilgamesh’s Constellation’s Command, humanity players still looked set to keep their win rate above 60%.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Bronze league player Carl, has won!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Silver league player Miyamoto, has won!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Diamond league player Yoon Seah, along with seven other human players, have won!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Victorious news poured in from all around as the BattleNet center was bustling with real-time win rate tallies.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Constellation’s Command is gone, but it’s pretty manageable.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The elven-like regenerative powers are gone, but it’s not like there’s no regeneration.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It looks like evolution is certain!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Staff was chatting enthusiastically.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan watched the sponsoring players excel, he thought,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is it because the Eternity stat has increased significantly? The 500 players also seem to have improved regenerative capabilities.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Though not as potent as Gilgamesh’s buff, the players’ regeneration had noticeably improved, almost unbelievably for typical humans.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether it was due to the effects of Eternity or some other factor, Seong Jihan watched the players’ movements closely, harboring doubts.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh… it’s done!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “300th player, Abdul, has achieved victory!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Once 300 out of 500 players secured victories ensuring a 60% win rate,
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s time to withdraw the buff.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan immediately retracted the buff.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though he initially planned to run the Constellation mode for just 10 minutes,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Constellation reach level is now 762.]
 </p>
 <p>
  He ended up using more time to secure a graceful finish.
 </p>
 <p>
  Had this been for seven days straight, the losses wouldn’t have been small.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If it weren’t for Gilgamesh, my level would have plummeted.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In times like this, he reluctantly had to admit Gilgamesh was somewhat helpful.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a mindset more grateful to Gilgamesh than ever, Seong Jihan continued to monitor the rest of the gaming situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the buff was cut, human players began to lose drastically.
 </p>
 <p>
  -What the, why are they losing so badly lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -The buff was cut lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -At least they secured a 60% win rate with 300 victories.
 </p>
 <p>
  -No way, everyone’s been losing after the 300th win lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -For real, it’s like finding a needle in a haystack to win without the buff
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yo, what would we have done without Gilgamesh? 🙁
 </p>
 <p>
  -A king who gave generously and left… We will remember you…
 </p>
 <p>
  With the cessation of both the Constellation’s Command and the Constellation buff, human players, like ghosts, began losing matches.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the end, only 30 of the remaining 200 managed to claim victories.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, powerful players had already secured their victories, hence why the win rate appeared even more dismal.
 </p>
 <p>
  Without the buff, achieving a 60% win rate seemed utterly impossible.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah… victors aren’t really making the headlines, are they!
 </p>
 <p>
  =It would’ve been tough without the buffs.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Humanity certainly benefitted from both Seong Jihan and the King of Humans, Gilgamesh!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Today seems like a day to commemorate him!
 </p>
 <p>
  =They say the land of Uruk, which he ruled, is present-day Iraq. Let’s toast to humanity’s evolution across to that land!
 </p>
 <p>
  With evolution now confirmed, the commentators talked about toasting, casually praising Gilgamesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  And as all 500 players concluded the game,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The evolution mission has been fully cleared.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The target species, ‘humanity’, will now evolve.]
 </p>
 <p>
  In front of everyone, including Seong Jihan, messages like this began to appear.
 </p>
 <p>
  [To suit the BattleNet environment, the efficiency of all stats will generally increase.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Depending on individual conditions, physical evolution may occur.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The stat efficiency boost applied to everyone.
 </p>
 <p>
  Physical evolution varied individually.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, observing these messages, examined his bodily condition.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm… seems like I’ve gotten a bit stronger.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The evolution wasn’t immediately noticeable since he was already very strong.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking he needed to test this later, Seong Jihan continued to watch people exiting the connectors,
 </p>
 <p>
  to see if anyone had undergone a physical transformation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Unc, Uncle!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Far off, Yoon Seah hurried toward him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Look at this!”
 </p>
 <p>
  She pointed to a spot on her body.
 </p>
 <p>
  “My ears…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Her ears were slightly protruding.

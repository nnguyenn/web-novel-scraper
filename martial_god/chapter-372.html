  Chapter 372
 </p>
 <p>
  =That’s Seong Jihan’s vortex! Is he trying to catch all the fleeing werewolves?
 </p>
 <p>
  =But the opposing players are already far away, fleeing at an incredible speed. Even with that dark vortex, it seems unlikely he’ll catch the wolves…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dark Soul Vortex, now a familiar sight to the commentators.
 </p>
 <p>
  This massive shadow vortex was one of Seong Jihan’s frequently used techniques, well-known enough that viewers could roughly gauge its range.
 </p>
 <p>
  -The speed at which he’s dispatching the wolves is no joke;
 </p>
 <p>
  -Will it reach them…?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Looks difficult? They’re fleeing too fast.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Guess he needs to chase them down one by one
 </p>
 <p>
  To onlookers, Seong Jihan’s Dark Soul Vortex seemed slightly off in timing.
 </p>
 <p>
  The werewolves, fleeing at full speed, were likely not to be caught given the vortex’s delayed activation.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah… Seong Jihan’s skill looks a bit different than usual!
 </p>
 <p>
  =It used to be a completely dark vortex, but now it’s mixed with white light!
 </p>
 <p>
  Initially, the Dark Soul Vortex was solely black.
 </p>
 <p>
  But as strands of white light began to intertwine differently than usual.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Grrr…rr…rrr”
 </p>
 <p>
  The bodies of the fleeing wolves began to float lightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Being sucked into the swirling vortex of black and white.
 </p>
 <p>
  And not just the wolves were being pulled in.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud-thud-crack!
 </p>
 <p>
  The grass that covered the plains of the Great Plains was being ripped off.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  Even the soil, which rooted the grass, was dragged along.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Wha, what…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [How is it reaching this far…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The wolves and the land itself were sucked into the vortex.
 </p>
 <p>
  Incapable of resisting, they were shredded inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Seong Jihan’s skill! Has it been upgraded?
 </p>
 <p>
  =Its range is much broader than usual…! Even the players representing their race can’t withstand the vortex’s suction!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Now, the black-and-white vortex seems about to swallow the entire map!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah, our base has also been destroyed!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dark Soul Vortex, now mixed with white, had evolved utilizing some techniques from the Taiji Swordsmanship, harnessing tremendous power, it even tore the steel scarecrows from the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  [3 of ‘humanity’s’ bases have been destroyed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan himself had destroyed three bases like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ugh… this, isn’t this far stronger than their warnings…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Before any more bases were destroyed, the last wolf was sucked into the vortex.
 </p>
 <p>
  The blue-furred wolf, who also acted as the coach for the opposing team.
 </p>
 <p>
  The furthest to flee, he was eventually dragged into the Dark Soul Vortex and dissipated into dust.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then.
 </p>
 <p>
  [All opposing team players have been annihilated.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Match 2 concludes.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Humanity wins.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Seong Jihan’ is selected as MVP of match 2.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The game concluded swiftly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked beyond the message window, gazing at the still-rotating black-and-white Dark Soul Vortex.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’m getting used to mixing life force with void. Thanks to Taiji Swordsmanship.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The key to advancing his Dark Shadow Technique was using life force alongside void.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, operating these inherently antagonistic powers synergistically was no easy feat, regardless of practice.
 </p>
 <p>
  But with recent significant growth in his ‘Eternity’ stat and handling of the Taiji Swordsmanship, he found clues for its development.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Though the Taiji Swordsmanship itself does not use the void…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak, who lived eternal, hadn’t wielded the void.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though his Taiji Swordsmanship wielded power akin to the void.
 </p>
 <p>
  Knowing even the surface of Taiji Swordsmanship’s mechanism made it easier to handle both Eternity and void.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is there a connection to what the Arena’s Master had said?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Arena’s Master, who seemed to know about the Taiji Swordsmanship, hinted that a human alone couldn’t have ‘created’ it without full control of his powers.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘When I reach Level 500, and the Void Training Room upgrades, I must delve deeper.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Right now, without a place to practice, Seong Jihan couldn’t utilize the Taiji Swordsmanship.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, he retracted the Dark Soul Vortex while pondering the sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  In the Space League’s coach’s office.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The blue-furred werewolf sat, staring blankly with a vacant expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  The second game on the Great Plains map.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})

 </div>
 <p>
  A map that, from the werewolf’s perspective, was almost guaranteed not to lose.
 </p>
 <p>
  But given the unforeseen encounter with a monster, the game ended abruptly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aren’t you going to draw a card?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s the point of drawing if we’re going to lose anyway…”
 </p>
 <p>
  To Davis’s question, the werewolf looked utterly defeated, his fur flopping down.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why give up on the game so early lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  -If you were crushed like in the second game, giving up makes sense.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Haven’t seen Seong Jihan’s vortex expand that much, when did it evolve?
 </p>
 <p>
  -But every time you see it, it’s wider. With their racial evolution, it’s not strange they’ve become stronger.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yeah, other people run around while he flies.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s continuous advancement.
 </p>
 <p>
  Was it due to racial evolution?
 </p>
 <p>
  To the spectators, this time appeared much stronger than usual.
 </p>
 <p>
  If they felt this way, imagine the opposing team seeing Seong Jihan for the first time.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Sigh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, the third game had to proceed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The werewolf coach sighed and finally pulled out a ban card.
 </p>
 <p>
  Banning the number one rank.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah, it seems the VIP option didn’t work this time!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Seong Jihan has been banned!
 </p>
 <p>
  For the werewolves, fortunately, Seong Jihan was banned.
 </p>
 <p>
  But they couldn’t choose the map they wanted.
 </p>
 <p>
  =This time the map is Southgate!
 </p>
 <p>
  =With alternating defensive and siege battles, the werewolves’ mobility will be completely blocked!
 </p>
 <p>
  =If they play like in the first game, there’s a high likelihood of victory in this match!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Southgate, huh… Is that monster banned?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Check during the match.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Alright.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The blue-furred werewolf, after being stymied by Davis’ response, left the coach’s office.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the third game began.
 </p>
 <p>
  =The human representative team… Overwhelming the opposition!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Is it the fallout from the second game? The morale of the werewolves seems depleted, barely mustering any strength!
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  =And from the werewolves’ perspective, the map inherently doesn’t suit them well! It’s not fit for siege battles!
 </p>
 <p>
  =I’m not sure who will take MVP this time! All players are performing evenly!
 </p>
 <p>
  The human representative team crushed the opposition.
 </p>
 <p>
  An even more decisive victory than the first game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers watching the match were in a festive mood.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Whoa… I woke up and we turned into a strong team…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is this… the power of evolution?
 </p>
 <p>
  -The opposition might be weak, haha.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Weak? Remember, we lost to the Zojin Tribe…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Right, never underestimate the 18th rank.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile…
 </p>
 <p>
  In an extraterrestrial chatroom on Seong Jihan’s channel.
 </p>
 <p>
  A few aliens gathered to watch the human games.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Humanity has indeed become stronger since becoming a lower-tier race.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Even without Seong Jihan, they won’t get relegated now.
 </p>
 <p>
  -If the race continues to grow from here, they’ll be quite competitive in BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Right. Humanity has incredible numbers, doesn’t it?
 </p>
 <p>
  Aliens, displaying newfound interest in race ‘humanity’, shared opinions while watching the game played by Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan silently observed the chat, then spoke up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Strength in numbers, huh… Are other races not as populous?”
 </p>
 <p>
  -Are you reading the chat?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Are there races with more numbers than humanity? Not none in the Space League, but it’s rare for a race to have so many players.
 </p>
 <p>
  -That’s why it’s absurd sometimes to see this viewer count. Didn’t expect BattleTube could be accessed by this many…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t every individual supposed to be a player?”
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s a matter of the gift.
 </p>
 <p>
  Doesn’t every adult in BattleNet system receive it?
 </p>
 <p>
  But the aliens responded as if they didn’t understand what that meant.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Every individual… what are you talking about?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Only a part of each race can be players;
 </p>
 <p>
  -I mean, there’s no race where everyone can play. But that would only be possible with admin connection.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yeah, that could be possible. Otherwise, it seems unlikely.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan tilted his head, asking the Shadow Queen.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Weren’t all shadow elves turned into players?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [No. Like your race, every one of us became players. Our race was directly or indirectly connected to the Green Administrator.]
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  “A connection with the administrator dictates who becomes a player?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I don’t fully understand the causal relationship myself. It’s just a guess.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… that’s unexpected.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Always thought humans were abundantly numbered, but it turns out, it’s not easy for other races to even access BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If it’s related to an administrator… could it mostly be the Red Administrator for humanity?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering the World Tree was planted, a connection with the Green cannot be dismissed.
 </p>
 <p>
  So many are involved with humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan pondered about both red and green while frowning.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ding.
 </p>
 <p>
  -What channel is this that’s been marked a topic of the month?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Human origin… evolved from the lowest-tier to lower-tier?
 </p>
 <p>
  -How did the Bronze League evolve…
 </p>
 <p>
  As the chatroom slowly filled with aliens drawn by the ‘topic of the channel’ tag,
 </p>
 <p>
  The regulars initiated the chat.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Did BattleTube mark this as this month’s topic?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ah, it’s supposed to start from the lower-tier.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Topic? Compared to when he won by turning the tables in the Arena, it’s rather dull nowadays haha.
 </p>
 <p>
  -With the viewership generally starting from lower-tier and up, suddenly we see a surge of newcomers.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Take advantage of the incoming tide.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Let’s go to the Arena one more time!
 </p>
 <p>
  Following the upgrade to a lower-tier and becoming a topic of the month, Seong Jihan drew considerable attention.
 </p>
 <p>
  He opened the main screen of BattleTube.
 </p>
 <p>
  Channels swamped not only from aliens but also from myriads of other sources.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among them, on the very top was the tab for the topic of the month.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘My channel seems to be at the very end here…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Swiftly scrolling through numerous channels, finally, Seong Jihan’s channel appeared modestly tucked away at the back.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if being at the back, being included here seemed to draw more aliens wondering what was happening.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Becoming a lower-tier brought some unexpected side effects.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, noting the increase in alien participants, was energized.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clearly, as seen earlier, it was time to row when the water floods.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘To advance the Star Buff, I do need to increase alien viewers…’
 </p>
 <p>
  More alien viewers meant the activation of the Star Buff.
 </p>
 <p>
  He couldn’t rest on the current capabilities of the Star Buff but needed continuous upgrades.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should consider ways to keep rowing.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan watched as the BattleNet connector opened and delved deep into his thoughts.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  On the bottom of the West Sea, within the drawn Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The translucent form of Dongbang Sak scrutinized it intently.
 </p>
 <p>
  While his physical body remained intact elsewhere.
 </p>
 <p>
  Part of his spirit, sent for exploration, now observed the degraded Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams, darkening his gaze.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Why is this here?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams under the sea.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had no recollections concerning this.
 </p>
 <p>
  Surely, upon seeing the formation, he was certain he had drawn it.
 </p>
 <p>
  But Dongbang Sak could not remember why it was there.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s like the related memories have been deleted.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He recalled what Gilgamesh had said.
 </p>
 <p>
  When asked why he pursued immortality, he couldn’t give a clear answer.
 </p>
 <p>
  Together with this reason, parts of his memories, particularly those related to the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams, were clearly missing.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Will the memories resurface if I dismantle this formation?’
 </p>
 <p>
  If the formation were intact, his spirit alone couldn’t destroy it.
 </p>
 <p>
  But this damaged formation seemed potentially dismantlable even by his spiritual form.
 </p>
 <p>
  The wholly vanished past memories.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak wondered if dismantling this would bring them back, as he slowly reached out.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Before his hand could touch it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, fire ignited on the beard of his counterpart in his physical location.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hm!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thump! Thump!
 </p>
 <p>
  Annoyed, Dongbang Sak quickly patted out the flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of all things to touch, why the beard?
 </p>
 <p>
  As he looked around for the culprit.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stop.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…You?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Surprised by a voice he had never heard in the physical realm.
 </p>
 <p>
  His eyes widened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Could it be the Third Disciple?”
 </p>

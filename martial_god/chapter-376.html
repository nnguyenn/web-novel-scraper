  Chapter 376

 <p>
  Chapter 376
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ve already leveled up.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A spark of surprise flickered in Seong Jihan’s eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was now September, and his level was at 431.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the speed of leveling up had significantly increased due to the stat seal, reaching level 500 still seemed a distant goal.
 </p>
 <p>
  At this rate, reaching level 450, which would qualify him for the Star League, seemed possible only by October.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is the seal from the Heaven’s Chaotic Flow having a similar effect to the stat seal?’
 </p>
 <p>
  While the stat seal was a restriction imposed by the system, the Heaven’s Chaotic Flow was an acupoint sealing technique created by Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  Could these two be interacting in some way?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Maybe I was close to leveling up already; I should fight a bit more.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With this thought, Seong Jihan scanned his surroundings on the survival map.
 </p>
 <p>
  The survival map ‘Desert of Relics’.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was a battle-ground where monsters guarding the relics and players seeking ancient artifacts clashed fiercely.
 </p>
 <p>
  Typically, the intention was to use the hidden relics in the ruins to gain an advantage in battle or to strategically use neutral monsters.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But whenever I got matched here, I just overpowered everything with brute force.’
 </p>
 <p>
  For Seong Jihan, who had vastly surpassed even the Grand Master level, neutral monsters and other players were no different – all could be swept away with a single strike.
 </p>
 <p>
  This often led to criticism that his channel lacked diverse content.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the situation was now different.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to create one-on-one situations. If there are more than two enemies, I could actually die.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Currently, he could only utilize about 20 percent of his Martial Soul’s power, largely due to the Star Buff being activated.
 </p>
 <p>
  With this reduced power, he could manage one-on-one fights against Grand Master level players, but in multiple combat scenarios, survival was not guaranteed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Luckily, it’s the ruins map this time.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With treasures likely hidden, the map’s name, ‘Desert of Relics’, didn’t go unnoticed by him before.
 </p>
 <p>
  After wiping out nearby enemies during a previous match, he kept one alive and used the Ice Sword Rain to search for artifacts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the Ice Sword Rain did not react to the artifacts here as they were not compatible with its level.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Pouring continuous power into the Ice Sword Rain, one did faintly lead me toward the center of the ruins…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The artifact he found back then was a buff item only effective within the game and was useless outside.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, in his current sealed state, he desperately needed it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll need to move carefully until I get the artifact.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Swooosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Enveloped by shadows, Seong Jihan disappeared, his presence vanishing.
 </p>
 <p>
  He stealthily maneuvered around, ambushing lone monsters or players.
 </p>
 <p>
  Areas with groups larger than two he avoided, pressing forward discreetly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though he could only use about 20 percent of his Martial Soul,
 </p>
 <p>
  Due to further development in utilizing his Martial Soul, he managed a top score in this map by sticking completely to stealth and ambush tactics.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’m currently third-ranked… the gap to the first isn’t big.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Maybe he doesn’t need to head to the central part?
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps it would be better to just find a good spot in the path and ambush from there, which could even potentially take him to first place.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as Seong Jihan considered changing his usual approach of heading towards the center for a discrete ambush spot.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Star Buff will be deactivated if the number of extraterrestrial viewers decreases by another 40 percent.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A warning message from the system popped up.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Losing the Star Buff could make even 1:1 fights tough.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Star Buff, which boosted his abilities by 60 percent, was like a lifeline for Seong Jihan, whose powers were sealed by the Heaven’s Chaotic Flow.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it vanished here, he’d struggle even in one-on-one combats.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan checked the atmosphere in the chat.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Today he’s playing oddly?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Not wiping them all out at once but playing by the book.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why not just sweep everything clean?
 </p>
 <p>
  -He’s just dragging out time for no reason sigh
 </p>
 <p>
  -Logged in to analyze this player’s strength — why is he holding back all of a sudden?
 </p>
 <p>
  Complaints from extraterrestrial viewers who wondered why he wasn’t displaying his usual one-shot-one-kill and appeared to be concealing his strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  -These guys were grumbling about lack of content, now they complain it’s not ending quickly LOL
 </p>
 <p>
  -Extraterrestrials are such a hard bunch to please, which beat should we dance to?
 </p>
 <p>
  -For real, they complain no matter what. What are they even expecting?
 </p>
 <p>
  -But why is he suddenly fighting like this?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Aw, he must have his reasons, where do you all get off critiquing him!
 </p>
 <p>
  Humans viewers, having received much from Seong Jihan, regardless of race or nationality, now sent overwhelming support for whatever he chose to do.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">

 </div>
 <p>
  ‘Would be nice if just the human viewers could sustain the Star Buff.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Just turning on the broadcast brought in viewership numbers in the hundreds of millions from humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  If these numbers alone could maintain the Star Buff, he would comfortably stick to stealth and ambush.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Before everyone leaves, I better finish this quickly.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Swooosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan stopped using stealth and moved towards the center of the ruins.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Intruder!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Eliminating the intruder.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan boldly moved towards the center, the ruins’ monsters spotted and attacked him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Made of giant statues, they emitted red rays from their eyes, pressing him hard.
 </p>
 <p>
  Normally, he could finish these foes with a single move of Total Annihilation Horizontal Sweep.
 </p>
 <p>
  But with his current limited power, it wasn’t possible to annihilate them in one strike.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to conserve my strength.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzzt!
 </p>
 <p>
  Dodging the laser rays shooting from their eyes, Seong Jihan progressed towards the center where the artifact was hidden.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is there something over there?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just kill him!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Players who felt there was something important in the central area saturated with statues attempted to block Seong Jihan, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘My senses aren’t completely dead. I can dodge.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Originally being a much stronger opponent, Seong Jihan fluidly evaded their attacks as he reached the ruins’ center.
 </p>
 <p>
  The center was just more desert and statues, different only in name.
 </p>
 <p>
  Remembering his previous experience, Seong Jihan closely inspected the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It was around here… the place emanating a strange aura.‘
 </p>
 <p>
  Swooosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  He dug his hand into the sand, rummaging through.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  He grasped something in his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  -That is…
 </p>
 <p>
  -He found the Golden Ox Figurine.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Did it give a buff effect?
 </p>
 <p>
  What Seong Jihan held was a small golden ox figurine, a seemingly trivial item guarded by powerful monsters of the ruins due to its diminutive size.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Despite its looks, the buff wasn’t bad.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan directly shattered the golden ox with his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have destroyed an Exiled God’s Relic.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [All abilities increase by 150% for 10 minutes.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The guardians of the exiled god express intense hostility toward you for destroying God’s Relic.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The guardians will move from their posts in an attempt to subjugate you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A simple buff that raised all attributes by 150% for 10 minutes.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the buff also had a serious disadvantage – it turned all the ruin’s monsters against him.
 </p>
 <p>
  But,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is actually better.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If the enemies came to him, he wouldn’t have to go looking for them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan drew his sword and spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fundamental Divine Art,
 </p>
 <p>
  Triad of Martial Mastery:
 </p>
 <p>
  Total Annihilation Horizontal Sweep
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the sword sliced horizontally, the enemies simultaneously split in half.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Finally!
 </p>
 <p>
  -It’s such a simple motion, but where does its world-splitting power come from?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Should have ended it like this from the start.
 </p>
 <p>
  -It’s still less powerful than usual. Some of the guys survived.
 </p>
 <p>
  Extraterrestrial viewers watched Seong Jihan’s Total Annihilation Horizontal Sweep and started figuring it out in their way.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Now that I see it, ordinary game viewers seem to gather here to analyze my power.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Outside of major incidents, like when the World Tree Yggdrasil appeared in chat, there wasn’t much reason for extraterrestrials to watch Seong Jihan’s ordinary games.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just by turning on the broadcast, all they see is him swinging his sword and sweeping everything away.
 </p>
 <p>
  They aren’t from his race, so why would they continuously watch someone else’s show of power?
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  The viewers that gathered to provide enough activity for the Star Buff were here to analyze his power.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching the chat in one eye,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan observed the remaining enemies.
 </p>
 <p>
  Monsters that weren’t swept away in one hit because his power was still under constraint.
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzzt…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan threw the Phoenix Flag above his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fundamental Divine Arts,
 </p>
 <p>
  Divine Thunder Decree:
 </p>
 <p>
  Celestial Judgment
 </p>
 <p>
  Above the ruins, a massive crack appeared in the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  A giant spear charged with white lightning, rather than his normal dark thunder due to sealed stats, fell to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kaboom!
 </p>
 <p>
  It completely decimated the area where the statues congregated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Using Total Annihilation Horizontal Sweep followed Celestial Judgment by cleared the map of ruins.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your level has increased by 1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Oh, it actually went up.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s eyes lit up as he saw the level-up message.
 </p>
 <p>
  Normally, no matter how many times he wiped them out, his level wouldn’t increase.
 </p>
 <p>
  But sealed by Heaven’s Chaotic Flow, leveling up seemed surprisingly easy.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘At this rate, I might need to continue gaming under the influence of Heaven’s Chaotic Flow…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Under usual circumstances, it seemed unlikely he would reach level 450 by next month.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, leveling up so swiftly under the effects of Heaven’s Chaotic Flow seemed to make a promotion match feasible by the end of September.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just then,
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wait, I’ve seen this in the data from Thunder God’s battle. Wasn’t this used by the Martial God?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Martial God? Are you talking about the monster that hunted thrones?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yeah. Thunder God was also taken down recently, and I managed to get a hold of some footage, which was spectacular.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Hundreds of spears like this fell on the stronghold of Thunder God.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Hundreds… With such power from one, indeed, it must be the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  Given that these analysts had gathered, it wasn’t surprising they quickly noticed the similarity between Seong Jihan’s Celestial Judgment and what was used by the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Looks like BattleNet is already circulating data about Thunder God’s throne being bombed. These guys… did they not previously recognize my abilities because I used it only in special missions?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Usually, in normal games, Seong Jihan would end them solely with Triad of Martial Mastery.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having used purely Divine Thunder Decree without void now allowed the analysts to realize he wielded power similar to the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  And they went further.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Isn’t his sword-swinging also similar to the Martial God’s?
 </p>
 <p>
  -It’s not on the level to be compared with the Martial God. After all, everyone performs cutting, vertical and stabbing with a sword, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  -It’s not just anything. Can a casual swing of a sword split the world?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Right. How casually he swings his sword and yet splits everything is very similar to the Martial God’s.
 </p>
 <p>
  -That’s ridiculous. You haven’t faced the Martial God, hence all this talk… Have your worlds been destroyed by the Martial God? How can you compare?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh yeah, boasting about your world being destroyed LOL
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite actually viewing Triad of Martial Mastery, the viewers still bickered among themselves.
 </p>
 <p>
  Substantial interest in the Martial God among the analysts.
 </p>
 <p>
  This could be used.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Martial God, huh… seems he’s famous indeed. You all mention him just by seeing this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a mysterious smile curling at the edge of his lips,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan swung his sword a few more times.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s see. This sword… wonder if it’s similar to the Martial God’s.”nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
 </p>
 <p>
  Continuously displaying the three sword techniques of Triad of Martial Mastery.
 </p>
 <p>
  With Mount Tai Suppression and Total Annihilation Horizontal Sweep, right up to Way of Immortals being executed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sands of the desert ruins split along with the swing of the sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow, that’s it! That’s the Martial God’s sword!
 </p>
 <p>
  -What are you talking about? It’s not at all. Did the world split in half? Did the sky split? It’s just some cracks around.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh, that’s probably because he’s lacking power. If only the power was similar, just watch.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Isn’t that the most important part?
 </p>
 <p>
  And still, the viewers argued even after witnessing Triad of Martial Mastery.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan replied upon seeing such chats.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems we won’t conclude today. Keep watching the next game. Indeed, see if there’s any connection between my martial arts and the Martial God’s.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Having thrown the bait about the Martial God to the analysts, he added,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The game will now end.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your level has increased by 1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘To gain 3 levels from a normal game… quite good.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With a satisfied smile, Seong Jihan logged out.

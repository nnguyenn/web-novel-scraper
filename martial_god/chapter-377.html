  Chapter 377
 </h3>

 <p>
  Chapter 377
 </p>
 <p>
  One week later.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan continued playing regular games in the state influenced by Heaven’s Chaotic Flow, he thought,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Now, it should be fine to kill.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Fundamental Divine Arts,
 </p>
 <p>
  Triad of Martial Mastery:
 </p>
 <p>
  Mount Tai Suppression
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  He swung his sword downward, cleaving his opponent vertically in two.
 </p>
 <p>
  The powerful blade aura didn’t just slash the opposing player but also tore through the space above where he stood.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Gah…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The final opponent is dead.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The game is ending.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your level has increased by 1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Having reached level 450, you are now eligible to participate in the Star League promotion match.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A notification of reaching level 450 appeared along with the message that he could now participate in the Star League promotion match.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘To think I’d get to the promotion match in September.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Heaven’s Chaotic Flow, imposed by Dongbang Sak to restrain him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan hadn’t yet gained enough insight to undo it with Martial Soul alone, but he had been able to use it effectively for leveling up.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But the opponents in the Star League will be stronger, so it will be difficult to use Heaven’s Chaotic Flow as I have been.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Although he had won first place in every regular game over the past week, there were many close calls where he could have died.
 </p>
 <p>
  If that was the case even against Grand Master League opponents,
 </p>
 <p>
  It would be tough to bind all his abilities like this in higher leagues.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan was contemplating about the Star League,
 </p>
 <p>
  -Look! That definitely seems like the Martial God’s sword. The power wavelength and attack range are identical!
 </p>
 <p>
  -Identical? I have videos of the Martial God and that’s nonsense. How could you even compare low-tier race sword skills with those of the Martial God? You’ve been making no sense for days now.
 </p>
 <p>
  -What? I have a video too. Want to bet?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Sure. Post your video first. I’ll be the judge.
 </p>
 <p>
  -No, you post yours first. You started this argument. -_-
 </p>
 <p>
  In the extraterrestrial chat window, an intense argument was ongoing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ever since Seong Jihan had mentioned the Martial God a week ago, the chat had been a constant forum of debate over whether his martial arts belonged to the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They’re at it again.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought to just ignore it and move on.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  -Check out this video via the link. Look at that. It’s exactly like the Martial God. He’s way stronger.
 </p>
 <p>
  -That’s a different technique. Post one using the same martial arts.
 </p>
 <p>
  -If you know the Martial God’s martial arts, shouldn’t you be able to perform this too, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A different technique?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan followed the BattleTube link posted in the chat.
 </p>
 <p>
  There,
 </p>
 <p>
  In the newly surfaced video, the Martial God with his face obscured by darkness, extended his hand toward the earth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rumble…
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, the ground split apart, and lava began to erupt from the crevices.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God’s technique transformed the world into a sea of fire in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s eyes sparkled with intrigue.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is new to me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In his past life, from the Martial God, he had learned the Nameless Divine Art.
 </p>
 <p>
  It consisted of the basic Triad of Martial Mastery and three advanced techniques: Divine Thunder Decree, Dark Shadow Technique, and Annihilation God’s Secret.
 </p>
 <p>
  None of these, however, had effects like the one he just witnessed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, the Nameless Divine Art probably didn’t encompass all of the Martial God’s techniques.’
 </p>
 <p>
  From the discussions in the chat, it seemed the Martial God had been hunting Constellations for a long time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Besides Triad of Martial Mastery and Annihilation God’s Secret, he must have used other martial arts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan keenly watched the Martial God utilizing his martial arts.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm… Even with Martial Soul, I can’t replicate it just from watching the video.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He had thought it might be possible to mimic the Martial God’s techniques with Martial Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  But it seemed unless seen in person, it wasn’t possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This extraterrestrial, a real Martial God enthusiast, huh.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the BattleTube link he followed,
 </p>
 <p>
  Not only the earth-shattering Martial God, but countless recordings of his martial arts execution were documented.
 </p>
 <p>
  After ending the broadcast, Seong Jihan earnestly explored that channel’s videos.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  ‘Truly powerful.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang! Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  Most videos featured the Martial God, and with just a movement of his hand, the world would burst apart.
 </p>
 <p>
  While it wasn’t incomprehensible like Dongbang Sak’s Taiji Swordsmanship,
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like the Martial God’s sheer power output was on another dimension, simply overwhelming his opponents.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing a planet split by Mount Tai Suppression made Seong Jihan unknowingly click his tongue.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha.”𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  As much as he grew, would he ever stand a chance in battle against him?
 </p>
 <p>
  A bit dismayed after viewing the Martial God’s collection by his enthusiastic follower, Seong Jihan widened his eyes at the next video.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Huh? This is…’
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, it appeared to be the Martial God fighting a constellation wielder who used clones, resembling a monkey.
 </p>
 <p>
  After several clashes, realizing it stood no chance against the Martial God, the monkey Constellation declared,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Martial God… I retreat this time, but I will surely seek revenge next time!]
 </p>
 <p>
  It split its body into tens of thousands of clones, attempting to flee from him.
 </p>
 <p>
  But.
 </p>
 <p>
  […]
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssshhh…
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Martial God moved his hand, darkness bloomed, creating a massive whirlwind.
 </p>
 <p>
  And As the whirlwind stirred,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Oh no…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The numerous clones were sucked in and annihilated instantly within it.
 </p>
 <p>
  The giant whirlwind of darkness, this was a technique well-known to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Dark Soul Vortex …”
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the techniques from Dark Shadow Technique that Seong Jihan frequently used, Dark Soul Vortex, albeit the Martial God’s version was on a much larger scale, the essence was the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But wasn’t Dark Shadow Technique obtained after subduing the Shadow Queen?’
 </p>
 <p>
  He had acquired Divine Thunder Decree after subduing the Thunder God and Dark Shadow Technique after defeating the Shadow Queen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan had always believed these two techniques originated from those victories.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet here was the Martial God using Dark Soul Vortex, a technique supposedly gained from the Shadow Queen, who was currently intact and wielding her own sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Queen, were there others among the Shadow Elfs who were subdued by the Martial God?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Not that I am aware of.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “How then is the Martial God using this power…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Are you referring to that swirling vortex? Well, it must have been obtained by conquering some entity of darkness. Such kinds of techniques are quite commonly used.]
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan was viewing the video alongside the Shadow Queen, who nonchalantly responded,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No. It’s definitely Dark Soul Vortex.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Convinced by his possession of Martial Soul, Seong Jihan was sure it was the same technique.
 </p>
 <p>
  That the Martial God used a martial art originally thought to be earned from a future conquest was perplexing…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Something doesn’t add up.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  Rewatching the Martial God using Dark Soul Vortex several times,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan couldn’t help but think of the Abyss’s owner—himself fragmented into pieces, raggedly stitched into the fabric of Taiji’s lost soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  Numerous versions of Seong Jihan had all been shredded by Dongbang Sak’s Taiji Swordsmanship.
 </p>
 <p>
  But originally, why were there so many Seong Jihans, and why had they all died like that?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…I need to subdue the owner of the Abyss for answers.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recalled the owner of the Abyss during the human extinction scenario—a formidable adversary even in a stationary state.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, disturbing him wrongly could summon the Taiji that could obliterate humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though Seong Jihan had grown significantly since then and could utilize the Star Buff,
 </p>
 <p>
  He was hesitant to confront such a foe without certainty of victory.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Then I need to practice the Taiji Swordsmanship, but with no training room, that’s impossible right now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Taiji Swordsmanship, an incomplete skill handed down through the Abyss’s owner,
 </p>
 <p>
  Perfecting it seemed essential for conquering the owner of the Abyss.
 </p>
 <p>
  For that, the shattered Void Training Room needed to be repaired first.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Or I could try to resolve the Heaven’s Chaotic Flow myself, and enter the second stage of the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams Formation to practice there…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Still elusive and complex, the flow of Heaven’s Chaotic Flow is such that reaching level 500 might happen quicker than deciphering and undoing it on his own.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Regardless, I need to ascend to the Star League first.’
 </p>
 <p>
  From the Grand Master League to the Star League.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan waited for the day of the promotion match in September.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  At the end of September.
 </p>
 <p>
  A small party was being held at the Sword Palace’s Daegi guild office.
 </p>
 <p>
  The guild master, Lee Hayeon, had called only key personnel to celebrate.
 </p>
 <p>
  The occasion was to salute the two players, Yoon Sejin and Yoon Seah, who were participating in September’s Master League promotion match.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  “Congratulations to both of you! Finally, after the boss, we have Master League players!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As fireworks burst, Lee Hayeon smiled broadly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin scratched his cheek sheepishly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ve only just made it to the promotion match, not yet promoted… But thanks for the congratulations.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, if we’re going, it’s a promotion!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The title of humanity’s first Master Leaguer had already been taken by Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  But since then, no newcomers had followed suit for a while.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, as September arrived and past Diamond League players finished leveling up,
 </p>
 <p>
  One by one, more players were ready to undertake Master League promotion matches.
 </p>
 <p>
  “In the US, player Oliver is also joining the promotion match this time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Player Barren seems to be able next month…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah, you’ve really grown fast. How have you reached the Master League already?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehe. Late Bloomer is getting really good. Just like its name.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Late Bloomer referred to an extraordinary ability that helped China’s Jin Yushua start late but climb to the world’s second ranking.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah had this, and with her mother, Seong Jiah, as a constellation,
 </p>
 <p>
  She was showing a brilliant progression this year, aside from Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jihan, what’s above the Grand Master?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Star League. I’m moving up this time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, so you’re going up this time… Wait, this time?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, as Sophia was chatting alongside Seong Jihan,
 </p>
 <p>
  She blinked in surprise at his words.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait… you haven’t been in the Grand Master rank for long, have you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I accelerated the leveling with an ability seal.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Whoa… Uncle, you’re also going for a promotion? Did you reach level 450?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not exactly. I wasn’t supposed to say anything! Today wasn’t supposed to be about me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll get a table ready for you right away!”
 </p>
 <p>
  It turned out not to be a party occasion for those climbing to the Master League.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the guild’s officials were taken aback and hurriedly rearranging the seating to feature Seong Jihan,
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, that’s fine. Save the party… yes, for when I become a constellation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A Constellation?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “With your pace, uncle, becoming a Constellation seems imminent…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We should still prepare a spot now!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ay, really, let it be.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a bit of back-and-forth over the party seating, the matter was eventually settled.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan caught up with others on recent happenings.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anything new lately?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The guild is still sailing smoothly. Your authority is so solid now that no one dares trouble us.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Since humanity evolved, human players have been trending upwards in BattleNet, creating an exceptionally positive atmosphere. Everyone wishes it would always continue this way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Post-evolution, humanity on BattleNet had immensely improved, especially since Diamond Leaguers were now frequently matching with extraterrestrial races,
 </p>
 <p>
  Winning at a significantly higher rate, adding competitive strength was one reason for the increased number of players moving up to Master League this month.
 </p>
 <p>
  But,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, the personal downside… it’s still about those with physical transformations. While I’m lucky with just pointed ears, those with fangs have had their lives inconveniently altered.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “With the increased support from Constellations, we’re advised to beware some odd ones.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Guess they’ve decided that low-tier races are worthy of patronage.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. But there are demands from Constellations as cruel as human sacrifices, so the alliance is officially investigating.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Human sacrifices.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Considering what extraterrestrials do on BattleTube, it’s sufficiently plausible.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking of the BattleTube, popular for broadcasts of alien torture and dissections, Seong Jihan frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  Increased support from Constellations was good, but this was a downside.
 </p>
 <p>
  And Yoon Seah, overhearing Lim Gayeong’s conversation, chimed in on the topic.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, come to think of it, I heard something about a constellation too. The Half-Elf community said a specific constellation is extensively supportive.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Half-Elf community? What’s that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A community formed by people with ears like mine.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Why choose such a name? It sounded like a minor version of elves.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought this as he asked Yoon Seah,
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, what’s the name of that specific Constellation?”
 </p>
 <p>
  ”‘Owner of Tuseong’.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Owner of Tuseong…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  That would mean the Wandering Martial God?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He’s acting publicly like this?’
 </p>
 <p>
  When Sung Jihan’s eyes were filled with doubt.
 </p>
 <p>
  [He claims to be the ‘Owner of Tuseong’? Must be out of his mind.]
 </p>
 <p>
  He received a message.

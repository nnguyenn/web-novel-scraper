  Chapter 378

 <p>
  Chapter 378
 </p>
 <p>
  The message sender was Pythia, the fourth disciple of the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking at her message, Seong Jihan asked,
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s this? Were you listening to our conversation?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I had something to tell you, so I was watching through Sophia for a moment.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Something to tell him?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the message with a puzzled expression and asked about the earlier topic.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, do you know who the Owner Of Tuseong is? Who is he?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It must be Gilgamesh. Recently, his tower has been expanded, and he’s up to his usual antics again.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You mean the Tower of Babel has been expanded?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. Since humanity evolved, remember?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “And what does that have to do with anything?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [He is the original king representing humanity, after all.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan furrowed his brow.
 </p>
 <p>
  “When Gilgamesh eagerly stepped in to help, I wondered why he was so proactive. So, it turns out he had a hidden agenda.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I did manage to cancel his command directive with the domination code, but he still found a way to gain without a one-sided loss.’
 </p>
 <p>
  And changing the constellation’s name to approach those with pointy ears.
 </p>
 <p>
  How sneaky.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, Seah, how many players are receiving sponsorship from the owner of tuseong?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… quite a few? At least several hundred. I’ve heard that as long as you have pointy ears, you get a sponsorship offer regardless of talent.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Several hundred… scattered around the world, huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yep. People are posting certification shots of their ears from all over the world, regardless of race.”
 </p>
 <p>
  This would make it difficult to cancel Gilgamesh’s sponsorships using the domination code.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why on earth is that guy so desperate to give out sponsorships?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [He probably wants to maintain a connection with humanity. Moreover, it seems he’s searching for something on Earth.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Searching for something?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I’ll investigate and let you know. It’s difficult to approach him recklessly since Dongbang Sak is also headed there.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Dongbang Sak?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes, he’s monitoring Gilgamesh.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “For someone being monitored, he’s quite active.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Indeed. I wonder what’s happened. Gilgamesh wouldn’t dare misbehave under his watch.]
 </p>
 <p>
  At her words, Seong Jihan was struck with a realization.
 </p>
 <p>
  During his encounter with Dongbang Sak’s ethereal form at the bottom of the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams Formation,
 </p>
 <p>
  Could it be that while Dongbang Sak was preoccupied with Earth, Gilgamesh began stretching his claws toward it?
 </p>
 <p>
  “For now, let’s inform the association that the owner of tuseong is Gilgamesh and announce that his sponsorship should be refused.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay. what if Gilgamesh changes his name again?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [He won’t be able to change his constellation name repeatedly. His recent rebranding to ‘Owner of Tuseong’ was likely due to humanity’s evolution.]
 </p>
 <p>
  So, the expansion of the tower gave an opportunity to change the constellation name?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan relayed this information to Lee Hayeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, then the name won’t change until he ascends to the intermediate tier. I’ll inform them right away!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a respectful nod towards Seong Jihan, Lee Hayeon went off to contact the association.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle, I’ll post a notice in the community too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A notice? How are you going to do that? You didn’t even create the community, did you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m one of the sub-administrators of the community.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Since when?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “When I signed up for the site, they offered me the position. It sparked my interest.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Tap, tap.
 </p>
 <p>
  With skillful finger movements, Yoon Seah quickly tapped on her phone screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shortly after, she drafted an announcement in English.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The owner of Tuseong is suspected to be Gilgamesh… Do not accept his sponsorship… how’s that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, that sounds good.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The announcement was promptly posted on the Half-Elf community.
 </p>
 <p>
  -The owner of tuseong is Gilgamesh?
 </p>
 <p>
  -No way, wasn’t he the ‘King Of Humans’? Can he change constellation names that easily?
 </p>
 <p>
  -This is unbelievable! After all the benefits we received from the owner of tuseong… for him to be Gilgamesh!
 </p>
 <p>
  -Doesn’t matter! Ever since I got the constellation’s support, I managed to reach Platinum League!
 </p>
 <p>
  -Who’s this sub-administrator playing pranks?
 </p>
 <p>
  -That’s Administrator Yoon Seah…
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as the post went up, it received a flood of comments.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">

 <p>
  Most were either denying that Gilgamesh could be the owner of tuseong or stating that it didn’t matter even if he was.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seems like most people don’t want to believe it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course. Even though opportunities for constellation sponsorship have increased, most players still haven’t dared to dream of it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right… Oh? The post got deleted. Crap, I’ve been stripped of my administrator rights!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing her announcement deleted and her admin rights revoked, Yoon Seah frowned deeply.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The admins here must already be Gilgamesh’s people.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then… it appears we’ll need to deal with this through the official alliance channels.”
 </p>
 <p>
  That guy was truly persistent.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan resolved to handle the matter systematically in cooperation with the alliance and then asked Pythia,
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, what was the purpose of the message you mentioned earlier?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ah, it’s related to the Star League promotion match…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why, are you going to notify me of the promotion match games?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Well, you’ve eliminated constellations already, so you’ll surely breeze through it.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia began addressing the main issue.
 </p>
 <p>
  [But once you achieve first place, among the rewards…]
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  =Hello, everyone!
 </p>
 <p>
  =September 25th, the day of the promotion matches has arrived!
 </p>
 <p>
  September 25th.
 </p>
 <p>
  As promotion matches began worldwide,
 </p>
 <p>
  Channel 0, which broadcasted TOP 100 promotion matches, was bustling with excited commentators.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Today’s scheduled matches will start from the silver promotion matches up to the master promotion matches. And…
 </p>
 <p>
  =The Star League! The much-anticipated promotion match to the Star League is scheduled last!
 </p>
 <p>
  =The player granted the chance to move up to the Star League is none other than Seong Jihan!
 </p>
 <p>
  =It feels like it wasn’t long since he joined the Grand Master League, but his rate of growth is astonishing!
 </p>
 <p>
  While other players lingered in Diamond League for months, with only a few finally obtaining a chance to promote to Master League,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan had already surpassed Grand Master League and was about to enter the Star League alone.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow, the Star League… he’s already going there?
 </p>
 <p>
  -I thought leveling up became really slow in the Grand Master League;
 </p>
 <p>
  -Well, if he keeps taking first place even with his stats sealed, he needs to be moved up quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  -For real, it was pitiful for his opponents.
 </p>
 <p>
  -We’ve pushed Seong Jihan up each time… Now he’s almost at the top, right? There’s nothing beyond Star League anyway.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Then he should become a constellation lolol
 </p>
 <p>
  With Seong Jihan on the verge of promotion to the Star League, humanity was in a celebratory mood.
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing a cornerstone of humanity’s strength in BattleNet continually grow rapidly, people were encouraged.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even as the TOP 100 promotion matches proceeded, the audience’s focus remained fixed on the final match.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh, when will this end?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Let’s just have a quick fight and move on to the Star League promotion match.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why was the Star League promotion match scheduled last;
 </p>
 <p>
  -I might as well take a nap lol
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite some interests being piqued by the Master League promotion match,
 </p>
 <p>
  =Now, the Master League promotion match begins!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Here we see a confrontation with extraterrestrial races!
 </p>
 <p>
  =From humanity, 14 players are participating. Let’s hope many make it through!
 </p>
 <p>
  In this survival map, involving 200 players including extraterrestrial races, humanity’s total participation numbered 14.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This won’t be easy.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the races participating in the Master League promotion match, Seong Jihan thought as much.
 </p>
 <p>
  While humanity’s race rating had risen to lower rank,
 </p>
 <p>
  Its opponents belonged to at least middle rank or higher.
 </p>
 <p>
  Starting with extraterrestrial races, who overwhelmed humanity with their sheer size.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah! Player Oliver! Caught as soon as it starts!
 </p>
 <p>
  =That huge crab-like race! Could it have resistance to magic? It’s tearing through barrier spells like paper…!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah. Player Oliver, the first to be eliminated…! I thought he would make it through…!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Player Je Galheon follows shortly after in defeat…
 </p>
 <p>
  =It seems the survival map is particularly tough on wizards!
 </p>
 <p>
  In the survival match, players started targeting the weakest-looking humanity first.
 </p>
 <p>
  One by one, human players began to die.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Everyone gather!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin, flying around with his sword, collected survivors.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, only five human players remained.
 </p>
 <p>
  =It happened in a flash…
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  =However, since the five of them grouped, they’re no longer being killed as easily!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Yes, Player Yoon Sejin chose an excellent position! Blocking paths makes it an easy spot to defend!
 </p>
 <p>
  =But it seems too wide for Yoon Sejin alone to hold… with paths open in both front and back.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin’s selected position was a favorable high ground for the five players to defend.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nonetheless, the paths were so vast that five people had difficulty blocking them.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah, Player Yoon Seah! Taking the lead!
 </p>
 <p>
  =She’s holding the front line in her undead state!
 </p>
 <p>
  =With all the warriors dead except for Yoon Sejin, she’s also filling in as a warrior!
 </p>
 <p>
  Having received Undead Blessing from Seong Jihan, Yoon Seah was fulfilling the role of a warrior among human survivors.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yoon Seah’s really getting good at being a warrior lolol
 </p>
 <p>
  -She’s literally blocking with her body keke since she regenerates anyway.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow, the five of them work together well. If it keeps up, they might all promote…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Then it’s 2 from Korea, 1 from the US, 1 from China, and 1 from India… Korea’s performing the best keke
 </p>
 <p>
  -?? Because of Seong Jihan, Korea’s always been the best.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Right, what’s the big deal lol
 </p>
 <p>
  If they managed to promote in the Master League, Koreans would dominate the numbers.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, with expectations raised by Seong Jihan, people showed little excitement for it.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Oh! Extraterrestrial players are giving up on attacking humanity!
 </p>
 <p>
  =The 5-man formation was too tight! They’re shifting from attacking the organized humans to fighting amongst themselves!
 </p>
 <p>
  =But they should not leave that position! As long as they survive, they can ascend to the Master League, so they should just hold out!
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks to their well-chosen location and successful defense, the five players managed to hold their ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  All they had to do was wait for others to die while they survived.
 </p>
 <p>
  And.
 </p>
 <p>
  =The promotion match ends with successful survival!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Among the 50 survivors, five are human!
 </p>
 <p>
  =The MVP goes to… a dragon player!
 </p>
 <p>
  Tszzz!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the BattleNet connector opened,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow… That was really tough.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah emerged, visibly exhausted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seems like the Werewolves were on the weaker side. Despite evolving, they’re still lower-ranked…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin, drenched in sweat, followed, drinking water.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although they survived narrowly, had they chosen the wrong position, all five might have been wiped out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sighing with relief, he looked at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now it’s your turn, Jihan. The main event is about to start.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Master League match was so intense; my match might turn out dull in comparison.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You mean it’ll be boring because you’re so strong, sweeping everything in one go?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Agreeing with Yoon Seah’s comment, Seong Jihan entered the promotion match.
 </p>
 <p>
  Star League promotion match.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, since he’d be facing Grand Master-level participants, the game should be easy.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Even players I met from the Star League at the Graveyard of Stars were weak.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I should finish first quickly and then pick the top reward Pythia mentioned.
 </p>
 <p>
  With casual thoughts, Seong Jihan entered the promotion match.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Star League promotion match is about to begin.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Players receiving special attention from the administrators gather…]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Administrator?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the system message mentioning players under the administrators’ attention,
 </p>
 <p>
  Standing in the darkened void, Seong Jihan kept watching.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Player Seong Jihan]nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Green Administrator especially notes you. They propose a special game to the administrators.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Black Administrator agrees.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The White Administrator abstains.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Besides the Green, now the Black too?’
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan expected the Green’s interest,
 </p>
 <p>
  Why was the Black Administrator involved?
 </p>
 <p>
  He was frowning with suspicion when,
 </p>
 <p>
  [With 2 approvals and 1 abstention, a constellation game will be conducted for Player Seong Jihan.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [A ‘Coronation Ceremony’ will commence.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Blinding light poured down amidst the darkness,
 </p>
 <p>
  As figures began to appear before Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Designate the Ruling Constellation of humanity to inherit the throne.]

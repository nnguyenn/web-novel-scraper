 <p>
  Chapter 379
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Ruling Constellation of humanity, huh.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought back to when he first acquired the Dominion trait.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dominion LV.1
 </p>
 <p>
  You receive additional bonuses based on the comprehensive evaluation metric of humanity and the growth of players you sponsor as a constellation.
 </p>
 <p>
  The bonus values are divided according to the number of sovereigns on the current planet.
 </p>
 <p>
  Currently, there are 4 sovereigns on this planet.
 </p>
 <p>
  The system message had indicated that including Seong Jihan, there were four sovereigns in total.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Then, excluding me, there are three sovereign constellations in existence, and the only candidate that comes to mind is Gilgamesh.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The other plausible candidate might be the third disciple of the Martial God, symbolizing fire.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the Martial God also possesses sovereign abilities, then there would indeed be three.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Or could there be a completely unrelated constellation?’
 </p>
 <p>
  A constellation game proposed and orchestrated directly by the Green Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because it was a game suggested by Green, Seong Jihan sensed there might be some kind of trap involved.
 </p>
 <p>
  But for now, Seong Jihan wasn’t in a bad situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  He would get to know the identities of the three silhouettes facing away from him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But it’s impossible to recognize who they are from just their backs.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The three sovereign constellations stood with their backs toward him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Their silhouettes were all of equal size, wreathed in a misty, faint white fog, making it impossible to discern who they were.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Select one among the three sovereign constellations to inherit the throne.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A system message prompting him to make a choice without knowing who they were.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’d like to thoroughly identify all three sovereign constellations during this opportunity…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as Seong Jihan tried to figure out the identities of the silhouettes,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Black Administrator proposes revealing information about the sovereign constellations to assist the player’s choice.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What?’
 </p>
 <p>
  As if understanding Seong Jihan’s curiosity, the Black Administrator made a timely suggestion.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The White Administrator abstains.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Green Administrator opposes.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [With 1 vote for agreement, 1 vote abstained, and 1 vote against, only partial information on the sovereign constellations will be disclosed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The White Administrator continued to abstain.
 </p>
 <p>
  And Green opposed.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the votes balanced, the conclusion was to reveal only partial information about the constellations.
 </p>
 <p>
  – So, there are three other sovereign constellations besides Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Who could they be? One has to be Gilgamesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Shouldn’t conqueror kings like Genghis Khan or Alexander be included too? LOL
 </p>
 <p>
  – Considering land size, it’d be odd if Gilgamesh wasn’t one. LOL
 </p>
 <p>
  – Oh, so they have to be ancient figures?
 </p>
 <p>
  While human viewers, mostly ordinary people, argued fervently over who the other two sovereign constellations might be.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wow, what’s happening? Three administrators have come forward…?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Aren’t the Black and White Administrators hardly ever active?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Exactly. Is Seong Jihan… the channel owner, someone noteworthy enough to draw the attention of administrators?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Since the Red Administrator is missing, when votes are 1-1-1, this outcome happens… I learned something new today.
 </p>
 <p>
  – I’m definitely watching today’s broadcast.
 </p>
 <p>
  The real uproar was among the extraterrestrials.
 </p>
 <p>
  As viewers from other worlds quickly began to fill the chat.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Total viewer count has surpassed the threshold.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The ‘Star’ buff has been upgraded.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Overall viewer rating is at the ‘slightly famous’ tier.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [When the Star buff activates, all abilities will be boosted by 80%.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [To upgrade the overall viewer rating to the next stage, special conditions must be met.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Already?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The number of viewers was so high that it boosted the Star buff by another level.
 </p>
 <p>
  The interest extraterrestrial beings had in BattleNet administrators was immense.
 </p>
 <p>
  And since the typically inactive White and Black Administrators appeared to make direct proposals,
 </p>
 <p>
  Word spread faster than light, making Seong Jihan’s BattleTube channel more popular than ever.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If not for the special conditions, my overall viewer rating might have upgraded two more times at least.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Seong Jihan channel had become a focal point across BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Why would revealing information about three constellations make administrators intervene? Isn’t this a lower-tier race’s world?
 </p>
 <p>
  – True. With administrator privileges, they could find out quickly. Why go through this process?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Something’s off here… there’s too little information, I’d say.
 </p>
 <p>
  – No, it’s not exactly absent but very hard to uncover. Like it’s isolated from the outside.
 </p>
 <p>
  – You too? I also hit a wall trying to independently investigate that planet.
 </p>
 <p>
  – A lower-tier race being so unique is odd…
 </p>
 <p>
  Extraterrestrial viewers focused on the unusual situation where three administrators had gathered and how difficult it was to obtain information on humanity.

 <p>
  ‘Receiving unexpected help from Black, and with Green’s opposition, this seems in my favor.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought as he waited for the information to be revealed.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [One by one, information about the Sovereign constellations will be revealed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Shhh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The mist slowly started to dissipate.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first to be unveiled was the figure standing on the far left.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the smoke fully cleared,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  The figure turned around.
 </p>
 <p>
  “To have administrators intervene directly… it seems being a lower-tier race isn’t entirely beneficial.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Curly brown hair, a long beard, and tanned skin.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recognized that face, having seen it through Pythia once.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, it’s Gilgamesh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. The king of humans and the beginning of humanity, that is who I am.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Holding his head high, Gilgamesh looked down at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  His gaze radiated a noble light.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Children always covet their father’s possessions. Are you after my throne?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Among my sons, you are one of the most exceptional… but the throne can’t be passed to you yet. Not when you are still insufficient compared to me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “When did I become your son?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan replied in disbelief, Gilgamesh answered with a serious expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “From the beginning of time. I sowed my seed across the world. All accomplished individuals are my descendants.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What about those who aren’t accomplished?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Unfortunately, they didn’t inherit my blood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wow, father’s being harsh! Get Gifted or get disowned by Gilgamesh, LOL?
 </p>
 <p>
  – If you’re talented, he acknowledges you as a descendant, LOL what a running joke.
 </p>
 <p>
  – He’s a different race and yet, what an ancestor lol
 </p>
 <p>
  – Keeps calling himself the king of humans… truly lives for self-adulation ㅡㅡ;
 </p>
 <p>
  Listening to Gilgamesh’s story, mockery filled the chat among human viewers, mostly ordinary individuals.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pointing to Seong Jihan’s ears, Gilgamesh said,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan, your ears haven’t manifested yet. Are you suppressing it on purpose?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What? If my ears manifest, does it mean your blood runs thick in me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. The traces of Yggdrasil etched into my body at the dawn of time have been inherited… Ah. You already have your own World Tree, so it might not manifest.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Really? So, the people with pointy ears are connected to you. That’s why you were active in the Half-Elf community.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a smile, Gilgamesh nodded affirmatively.
 </p>
 <p>
  “As your father, I warn you. It’s better not to choose me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you call yourself my father one more time, I’ll choose you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha… I forgive your doubts and wanderings about your roots with magnanimity. However, rebellion against me will not be tolerated.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Rebellion?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan realized from Gilgamesh’s serious gaze that he genuinely believed himself the King of Humans, with humanity being merely his descendants or subordinates.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Strategically, choosing me is a mistake. I am one who contends with the Martial God. The enemy’s enemy is a friend, isn’t it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, Gilgamesh pointed to the side.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There are still two other sovereign constellations apart from me, aren’t they worth examining?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, that’s true, but…”
 </p>
 <p>
  He really doesn’t want to be chosen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was indeed curious about the other constellations and didn’t plan to choose Gilgamesh just yet either.
 </p>
 <p>
  But he couldn’t pass it up without asking a question.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then before I look at the others, explain what you mentioned earlier.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you mean?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You said being a lower-tier race isn’t entirely beneficial.”nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, you mean that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh uncrossed his arms and pointed his finger into the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Becoming a lower-tier race has attracted the attention of the administrators, as you can see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “And before?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Most races in the universe remain at the lowest tier. Over 90 percent of races aren’t scrutinized individually by administrators.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So when a race is upgraded, administrators start paying attention.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, exactly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan listened and thought about how BattleTube viewers also focused intensely when humanity evolved,
 </p>
 <p>
  Black and White Administrators started overseeing and monitoring humanity post-evolution as lower-tier races.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘To be monitored by three administrators not long after the race upgrade… it’s as if they were waiting for humanity to evolve and then flooded in as soon as it happened…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Feeling unsettled about the situation, Seong Jihan turned his attention to the administrators.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’d like to see the next constellation.”

 <p>
  [Information on the sovereign constellations will be revealed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The mist cleared again, revealing another figure.
 </p>
 <p>
  A woman shrouded in white cloth emerged this time.
 </p>
 <p>
  With red hair and blue eyes, and a brilliant white eye shining on her forehead,
 </p>
 <p>
  It was someone Seong Jihan had seen at the ‘Sanctuary of the Fallen Apollo.’
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you… Pythia?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Y-yes, that’s right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a startled expression, she glanced around her surroundings.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You too have the Dominion trait?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No. How would a prophet practice dominion… It was just a solitary trait! So, I was at ease, eating potato chips and watching your channel, but suddenly my avatar was summoned!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Full of grievances, Pythia exclaimed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “For real! In my prophecy, there was no mention of this game! Suddenly, a coronation ceremony unfolded… and I got summoned! This lowers the dignity of a prophet!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The prophet who had revealed Gilgamesh’s identity to Seong Jihan said.
 </p>
 <p>
  -When you get the first-place reward, choose the one in the middle… Make sure to choose it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Insisting that he must choose the middle reward as first place in the Star League promotion match.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the actual contest turned out to be a coronation ceremony, and one of the summoned opponents was Pythia.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan gazed at her with skeptical eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll believe you only after I see for myself.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, really! I’ll show you. Wait… What? When did I get the Dominion trait? And why is the level… so high?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Trying to prove her innocence by displaying her status window,
 </p>
 <p>
  She fell silent upon seeing the Dominion trait’s level.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This makes no sense… I’ve never had this… Why me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Pythia was also a sovereign… How well you’ve hidden it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If I was really a sovereign, I wouldn’t be angry. I’ve struggled so hard to build a reputation as a constellation… This is a scam!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even as she loudly protested about suddenly gaining the trait,
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s no way the Dominion trait would just appear. Stop acting, Pythia. You’re disgraceful.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh, Gilgamesh…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you’re truly outraged, why not relinquish the throne to him?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A trait that wasn’t yours anyway. Would it matter if you gave it away?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh taunted, suggesting that she could pass on the throne if she was genuinely indignant.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia, biting her lip,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Fine. Seong Jihan, choose me. I’ll give away this suddenly acquired Dominion trait immediately.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Are you serious?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. You might want to accept it? It’s level 8!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What?! Level 8?”
 </p>
 <p>
  – No way, you’re just handing over a Level 8 Dominion trait?
 </p>
 <p>
  – This is insane…!
 </p>
 <p>
  – How can a lower-tier race constellation be Level 8?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Is this all orchestrated? Are even the administrator message windows fabricated?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Who’s crazy enough to impersonate an administrator…?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wow, I wish I were in his place. I’ve been stuck at Level 3 for a hundred years…
 </p>
 <p>
  Extraterrestrial viewers were shocked at Pythia’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  Level 8 in Dominion wasn’t an achievable state for just anyone.
 </p>
 <p>
  And she was offering to pass it on.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…It’s so beneficial that it feels like a trap.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s suspicion was natural.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia lifted her index finger.
 </p>
 <p>
  “In return, don’t reveal information about the next constellation. That’s my condition for passing the throne.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm. To not reveal about the next constellation…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. The third entity. His information should not be disclosed publicly. If this condition is met, I’ll relinquish the throne in the coronation ceremony.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do not disclose. Is that your prophecy?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Something like that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The third entity, the one called Emperor Ashoka.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was presumably the original owner of the third disciple’s Annihilation God’s Secret: Return of the Light.
 </p>
 <p>
  The martial art Return of the Light, which rewound time by one minute in the battle against the Little Sun.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had tried continuously to delve deeper into this technique afterward but had made no progress.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The highly suspicious third entity… but practically speaking, attaining Level 8 Dominion might be more advantageous than uncovering his information.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if inheriting Level 8 instantly seemed uncertain, receiving a portion of those levels was a significant benefit during his arduous journey to build constellation fame.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Ability comes first.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Deciding on his approach, Seong Jihan pressed the system window.
 </p>
 <p>
  And when he touched the prompt to proceed with the coronation against ‘Pythia,’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud.
 </p>
 <p>
  His finger halted.
 </p>
 <p>
  No, to be precise.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Did time rewind?’
 </p>
 <p>
  As his finger was about to press, it moved back, as though time had subtly rewound.

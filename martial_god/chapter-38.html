  Chapter 38
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  August 15th.
 </p>
 <p>
  In Korea, it is celebrated as Independence Day, marking the country’s liberation from Japanese colonial rule.
 </p>
 <p>
  In Japan, it’s a day they prefer not to dwell on too much, the day they commemorate the end of the war.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the Independence Day of 2020 held an even more special meaning for the two historically entwined nations.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s because there was a scheduled match between the two countries in the BattleNet Northeast Asia League.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Korea-Japan match on Independence Day!
 </p>
 <p>
  When Sword King was still in Korea, the Korean people eagerly anticipated this day.
 </p>
 <p>
  From 2019 to early 2020, Korea’s national team was in top form, especially against Japan, where they had a significant advantage.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hence, most people never doubted that they would witness the Japanese team’s crushing defeat on this historic day.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, the situation has changed now…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Sitting at her desk, Lee Hayeon stared intently at the text Seong Jihan had sent.
 </p>
 <p>
  [8.15 Korea-Japan match results]
 </p>
 <p>
  [1st Match: Korea wins / MVP Lee Jinwook]
 </p>
 <p>
  [2nd, 3rd, 4th Matches: Japan wins / MVP Ito Ryuhei]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Predicting Japan’s win is obvious…’
 </p>
 <p>
  From a purely objective standpoint, without letting national pride cloud judgment, Japan’s victory was expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  After all, Korea’s core power, Sword King, had transferred to another team.
 </p>
 <p>
  The online sentiment was the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  If one had to bet all their wealth, Japan was the overwhelming choice, highlighting the vast difference in team strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But a 1:3 score and even predicting the MVP… This doesn’t make sense.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The lineup for the 8:15 national team match had already been announced.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sword King was set to participate in all matches, from the 1st to the 5th.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, they’re saying Korea will win the first match against a team with Sword King?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Impossible.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Before the lineup was revealed, maybe.
 </p>
 <p>
  But now, with Sword King’s participation in all the matches, the majority predicted a 3:0 victory for Japan.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘And the 1st match MVP is Lee Jinwook?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Jinwook.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was a player Lee Hayeon was quite familiar with.
 </p>
 <p>
  Being a Diamond League player that the Twin Star Guild boasted about and a national team member.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Lee Jinwook’s position was a supporter, a position that rarely wins MVP.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially in a match as unfavorable as this one, it’s even harder for a supporter to become MVP.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t want to waste money on such an obvious match…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking discontentedly at Seong Jihan’s text, Lee Hayeon decided,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah! Let’s just waste 5 million won.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She decided to just think of it as an investment in Seong Jihan and bet as he had predicted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Huh, the odds are only in double digits.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Given the 1:3 score and even specifying the MVP, she expected higher odds.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon briefly tilted her head but then showed an indifferent expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It doesn’t matter. It’s not like I’m going to win anyway.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was money she’d already written off.
 </p>
 <p>
  No, it was a ‘rational purchase’ to increase her connection with Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now that’s settled…”
 </p>
 <p>
  After making her bet based on Seong Jihan’s prediction, Lee Hayeon, staring at her smartphone, thought,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Now for my real bet!’
 </p>
 <p>
  She quickly lit up and poured a large amount of money on the universally expected 3:0 victory for Japan.
 </p>
 <p>
  She was certain that Seong Jihan’s prediction was nonsense.
 </p>

  Inside Kim Heesu’s car.

 </div>
 <p>
  “Wow~! Seah, your uncle is really amazing~!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Returning home after finishing Student Council work, Kim Heesu exclaimed as she watched the broadcast with Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  “He could clear the Conqueror’s Mausoleum like that!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I know, right? It’s so fascinating.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s hard to believe he’s just Bronze Rank…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Heesu looked at Seong Jihan on the screen with amazement.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your uncle seems completely different from when I saw him at your house. He’s become really cool, hasn’t he?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehe… Really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. Back then, he reeked of alcohol and had messy hair.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It might have been after he won or lost a bet on BattleNet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What’s the difference?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If he won, he drank out of excitement. If he lost, he drank out of frustration.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Anyway, the conclusion was about alcohol.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Heesu chuckled as she looked at her phone.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Among all the promising talents I’ve seen, he seems the most outstanding…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, the younger brother of the Priestess Seong Jiah.
 </p>
 <p>
  She thought he lacked any special abilities, but who would’ve thought he had this talent hidden?Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘With that level of skill, he has every potential to become a star player.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Heesu’s eyes sparkled as she looked at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  And her interest grew even more when…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow, uncle, what’s that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan, who was dragging his party members around, faced off against the Conqueror’s statue, he was growing stronger.
 </p>
 <p>
  And at the end of the video, seeing Seong Jihan’s sword break the Conqueror’s bow, Kim Heesu couldn’t help but be astonished.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is… is that even possible?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, I knew my uncle was strong, but to that extent…”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the video ended with Seong Jihan acquiring the Phoenix’s Arrow, Kim Heesu looked at Yoon Seah with envy.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re so lucky, Seah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your whole family has received high-grade Gifts. I bet you’ll get one too, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah’s father had an SSS-grade gift, her mother, Priestess, had an SS-grade, and considering the incredible strength displayed by Seong Jihan on screen, he undoubtedly had a high-grade Gift too. That’s why Yoon Seah was considered the crown jewel in the BattleNet industry.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Gifts and genetics aren’t related.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come on. Still, three people in your family turned out great, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Um… hehe. I guess so.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if she tried not to expect much, given her family’s history, she couldn’t help but have high hopes for her gift.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Speaking of which, your birthday is on the 22nd, right? It’s not far off now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. I wonder what gift I’ll receive… I’m a bit nervous.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehe, what do you have to worry about? Great! I’ll get you a grand birthday gift!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come on~ What gift?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah waved her hands dismissively, saying it was fine.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, you must accept it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Heesu said so with a meaningful smile.
 </p>

 <p>
  [You’ve achieved 1st rank in the dungeon game.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [For achieving 1st place, your experience and GP acquisition rate increased by 50%.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your level has increased by 1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’ve acquired 5,000 GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’ve acquired 1,000 Achievement Points as a reward.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan began to meticulously go over the rewards he had postponed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Given it was my first time clearing dungeon mode, I even got additional Achievement Points.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [As the sole 1st place, you’ve acquired all the gold bars stored in the Conqueror’s Mausoleum.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’ve acquired 40,000 GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’ve cleared the hidden achievement, ‘Solo Dungeon Clear’.]
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  [You’ve acquired 3,000 Achievement Points as a reward.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Conqueror’s Mausoleum, infamous for its stingy rewards, gave out a significant amount of GP when he claimed all the gold bars, typically split between four players, all for himself. Additionally, clearing the hidden achievement boosted his Achievement Points significantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’ve cleared the hidden quest, ‘Show True Respect to the Conqueror’s Statue’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’ve acquired 5,000 Achievement Points as a reward.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’ve acquired the Conqueror’s arrow, ‘Phoenix’s Arrow’, as a reward.]
 </p>
 <p>
  From the Conqueror’s Mausoleum alone, he was able to harvest 10,000 Achievement Points.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The rewards from yesterday’s survival game don’t even compare.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A satisfied smile naturally formed on his face.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though he only leveled up once, with 45,000 GP, 10,000 Achievement Points, and the Phoenix’s Arrow, the rewards he received for a single game were incredibly substantial.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Should I check out the description of the Phoenix’s Arrow?’
 </p>
 <p>
  [Phoenix’s Arrow]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Grade: A]
 </p>
 <p>
  [An arrow made from the feather of the Phoenix and belongs to the Conqueror.
 </p>
 <p>
  When shot, it exudes immense power and returns to the owner’s hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Phoenix’s flames are sealed within, and the arrow disappears after being shot 5 times.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I thought it would be grade S.’ Compared to the power the Conqueror’s statue showed, its grade was only A.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps it’s because the arrow disappears after being shot five times.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, considering it came from a Bronze-level dungeon, it was an item that could be described as overpowered.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll need to use it as a spear for a while.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As long as it’s not thrown, it can be continually used as a weapon.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘And for the GP… let’s bet it all on the Korea-Japan game.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recalled the message he sent to Lee Hayeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  The prediction of one win, three losses, and the MVP.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was information he was certain of from his past memories.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was also the first game where Yoon Sejin participated as a member of the Japanese team and led Korea into a downfall.
 </p>
 <p>
  The flow of the game was also markedly different from the general predictions at that time.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Korea winning the first game was against everyone’s expectations…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan logged into BattleNet on his smartphone and placed the same bet as Lee Hayeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  The difference between him and her was:
 </p>
 <p>
  While she only bet 5 million won,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan poured in all his assets.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘1:37, huh.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even after correctly predicting the game’s outcome and the MVP, the odds were lower than expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, looking at this, Seong Jihan was sure.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Yoon Sejin. You also bet like this, didn’t you?’
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s always a reason for low odds.
 </p>
 <p>
  Either many people placed bets,
 </p>
 <p>
  or, like Seong Jihan’s bet, a large sum was poured in.
 </p>
 <p>
  The source of that money was probably Yoon Sejin.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recalled the game from his past life.
 </p>
 <p>
  During the first Korea-Japan game,
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin deliberately died at the hands of the supporter, Lee Jinwook.
 </p>
 <p>
  He took off all his armor and inflicted self-harm.
 </p>
 <p>
  He only allowed Lee Jinwook to deliver the finishing blow.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That’s why Lee Jinwook was able to become the MVP.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In his later interviews, he said he did it deliberately due to conflicts with the Japanese team.
 </p>
 <p>
  But Seong Jihan suspected match-fixing.
 </p>
 <p>
  And seeing the lower-than-expected odds now, that suspicion gradually turned into conviction.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Still, just in case, I shouldn’t use Seah’s share.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The 50 billion won Yoon Seah received was the niece’s assets that he must absolutely protect.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no need to mobilize that money.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Instead, I should bet all of mine or whatever I earn on this.’
 </p>
 <p>
  And so, a week passed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The day of the final showdown.
 </p>
 <p>
  The 15th of August, Independence Day, dawned.

  Chapter 380

 <p>
  Chapter 380
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Could this be… the work of the third entity?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The retraction of his finger, continuously and minutely repeating in slight reversals.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a phenomenon that Seong Jihan had experienced once before.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sensation of time reversing.
 </p>
 <p>
  This occurred when Annihilation God’s Secret: Return of the Light was used properly.
 </p>
 <p>
  But now, to see it unfold just to prevent Pythia’s coronation ceremony…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It appears the final sovereign constellation is likely the third disciple.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan judged so and simultaneously harbored doubts.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Why is he attempting to stop me from choosing Pythia?’
 </p>
 <p>
  With BattleNet administrators involved, all eyes were focused on this location.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Pythia said, if information were publicly disclosed here, it wouldn’t benefit the third constellation either.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet they were impeding this.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, if I continuously keep trying, Return of the Light can’t be used infinitely.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With all administrators watching the current situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though he could manipulate slight moments with Return of the Light, if it prolonged, the administrators would surely catch on.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he truly desired Pythia’s Level 8 Dominion trait, the right move was to persist here and continue his attempts.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I am curious why he’s doing this…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The third disciple, using the power to rewind time to send Seong Jihan signals.
 </p>
 <p>
  Disclosing the information might shed some light on his incomprehensible actions.
 </p>
 <p>
  After deep contemplation, Seong Jihan reached a conclusion.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I want to see the next constellation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, wait a moment…! I said I’d give you the Dominion Level. Please, choose me!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite Pythia’s attempts to stop him,
 </p>
 <p>
  “No. Reveal the next constellation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan confirmed that he would see the next constellation.
 </p>
 <p>
  – ?? Giving up on Dominion Level 8?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Does he not know how hard it is to raise constellation levels?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Even just rising 1 or 2 levels would be significant.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Who says no to free gains? LOL
 </p>
 <p>
  – But can you trust her words? She might backstab once chosen.
 </p>
 <p>
  – There’s that, too…
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers couldn’t hide their curiosity about Seong Jihan’s decision.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was incomprehensible to let go of a chance to boost constellation levels so easily.
 </p>
 <p>
  Proceeding disclosure while viewers remained puzzled.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Information about the sovereign constellations will be revealed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the last sovereign constellation’s appearance gradually emerged,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Haa…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia deeply sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  A pale face with long, black hair flowing down.
 </p>
 <p>
  The third disciple looked like a young man.
 </p>
 <p>
  A man of similar height to Seong Jihan with striking features and
 </p>
 <p>
  “We finally meet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He glared at Seong Jihan, his eyes glowing red.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nice to meet you, the one who awakened me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You are the third disciple?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. In this world, I was known as Ashoka.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The third disciple confirmed his identity as King Ashoka, as Pythia had suggested.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh, looking at him with interest, spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, you have fully awakened, Ashoka?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not fully. Only my consciousness is active, my true self remains sealed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is the Martial God still suppressing you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Something like that. I also haven’t awakened as it’s not yet my time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka turned to Pythia.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So rest assured, prophet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What do you mean?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I won’t act recklessly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s see… we’ll be watching.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Finishing his conversation with the two, Ashoka turned back to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, would you choose me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Take my test.]
 </p>
 <p>
  At Ashoka’s word’s end,
 </p>
 <p>
  His voice echoed inside Seong Jihan’s mind as if it were an auditory hallucination.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is his true self communicating telepathically?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought as he responded,
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, what’s your Dominion level?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I cannot tell you that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Dominion level I can offer now is 8. Equivalent to Pythia.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [However, you must pass my test.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Wouldn’t Pythia, who offers it for free, be better?
 </p>
 <p>
  But as if he read Seong Jihan’s mind, Ashoka continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Pythia… trust her in usual times, but not at decisive moments.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Decisive moments.
 </p>
 <p>
  Was he implying this moment now?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It was suspicious how she suddenly gained the Dominion trait.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia, who was so incongruous with sovereign constellations.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">

 </div>
 <p>
  It was already strange she suddenly got this trait, and to have it at Level 8 was even more dubious.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not that he could fully trust Ashoka before her either.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Pythia, now that Ashoka has been revealed, is our earlier deal off?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The earlier deal… about passing the throne?”
 </p>
 <p>
  She glanced at Ashoka and then spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Still possible. For now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “For now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even though he appeared, nothing significant has happened. So, choose me rather than having the coronation with him.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite saying information disclosure would cancel the coronation earlier, now changing her words once more.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan gazed at her calmly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I suppose I have to proceed with Ashoka’s coronation instead.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No…! Why?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your words kept changing about this. It’s hard to trust you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia kept silent quietly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Haha, wise choice. Handing over constellation traits so easily… there must be ulterior motives.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Not chosen by Seong Jihan, Gilgamesh watched with a smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do you choose the sovereign constellation ‘Ashoka’ as the coronation ceremony participant?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s answer, the two constellations began to disappear.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Ashoka. I trust in your assurance not to act reckless.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We shall see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With the two constellations gone,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The coronation ceremony protagonist, ‘Ashoka,’ designates the map.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Special map, ‘Calamitous Flames,’ summons player Seong Jihan.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The map for the coronation ceremony.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was summoned to ‘Calamitous Flames.’
 </p>
 <p>
  * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The special map, Calamitous Flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the name suggested, it was filled entirely with flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is this hellfire?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Was it designed just to burn the player alive? LOL nothing but flames here.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Doesn’t look any different for aliens, huh? They see only flames too.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Can’t even see where Seong Jihan is;
 </p>
 <p>
  Due to the raging flames, even Seong Jihan, who should navigate the map, wasn’t visible on BattleTube.
 </p>
 <p>
  As people were perplexed, wondering where he could be,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is this the test?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, amidst the flames, scrutinized his intact body.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not only his body, but even his clothes weren’t scorched in Calamitous Flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though he had prepared defenses upon being summoned,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The flames here… seem to have no intention of burning me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite his preparations seeming unnecessary, the fire didn’t harm Seong Jihan at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  What kind of test is this?
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have far more “Red” than expected.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka’s voice echoed again.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Utilize your stat Red to find me.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka spoke with certainty regarding the stat ‘Red.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He seemed to understand this ability thoroughly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Indeed, the stat ‘Red’ was permanently consumed when Return of the Light was used against the Little Sun… there must be a connection.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan drew out the Phoenix Flag, unleashing the power of ‘Red.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Fundamental Divine Arts,
 </p>
 <p>
  Heavenly Dragon Thunder Fire:
 </p>
 <p>
  Dragon Thunder.
 </p>
 <p>
  From the tip of the spear surged crimson electricity enveloped in flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  It radiated in all directions but soon was engulfed by the flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There’s a path where Dragon Thunder persists.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In the fierce flames, Seong Jihan followed the lingering trail of Dragon Thunder.
 </p>
 <p>
  Where he went, the flames were notably weaker compared to surrounding areas.
 </p>
 <p>
  Following the trail of Dragon Thunder,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ho…”
 </p>
 <p>
  He exited the flaming region, stepping onto a land covered in red soil.
 </p>
 <p>
  In contrast to him advancing into a new zone,
 </p>
 <p>
  -Still just flames; this map is crap.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Which channel is this? Joined thinking there were admins, but just flames?
 </p>
 <p>
  -That’s over. But they might return, so waiting.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ha, are you kidding? What’s this?
 </p>
 <p>
  BattleTube viewers, seeing the same flames, voiced their complaints.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Seems Ashoka did something to block external information.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching their reactions, Seong Jihan assessed the situation while surveying his surroundings.
 </p>
 <p>
  The barren land paved with red soil.
 </p>
 <p>
  Above, the fierce flames he had passed kept burning.
 </p>
 <p>
  Walking across the red soil,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is…’
 </p>
 <p>
  A staircase descending deep into the earth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Stretching endlessly to an unknown depth.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to go down.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud. Thud.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Walking cautiously down the stairs,
 </p>
 <p>
  Rumble!
 </p>
 <p>
  A section of the grand staircase collapsed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ugh… Ugh…]
 </p>
 <p>
  From there, emerged a skeleton with red bones, groaning.
 </p>
 <p>
  The red-skinned undead, human-sized, approached Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Release me now…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Rumble!
 </p>
 <p>
  As it charged,
 </p>
 <p>
  The ground around the stairs crumbled, unleashing undead monsters.
 </p>
 <p>
  Skeletons, zombies, and ghosts.
 </p>
 <p>
  The types of undead varied, but all shared the common characteristic of emitting a red hue.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Their movements are slow, not very strong.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With such weak opponents, formidable martial arts wouldn’t be necessary.
 </p>
 <p>
  Igniting the dark blade, he lightly swung in the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fundamental Divine Art,
 </p>
 <p>
  Triad of Martial Mastery:
 </p>
 <p>
  Total Annihilation Horizontal Sweep
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  At a single stroke, the undead horde split apart simultaneously.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  [This… cannot… end…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Flames erupted from the bodies of the red undead, restoring them to their previous forms.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the light swing, seeing their easy recovery,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan observed the red undead’s actions before pulling out his spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle!
 </p>
 <p>
  Crimson electricity rose from the spear’s tip.
 </p>
 <p>
  With greater firepower, it showered the undead.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ahh…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [At last… I die!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Struck by Dragon Thunder, the undead’s bodies burned, emitting delight.
 </p>
 <p>
  They rejoiced at their demise.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having wiped out the enemies, Seong Jihan peered below.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No need to engage them. Should I just jump down?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Initially descending slowly, one step at a time,
 </p>
 <p>
  The enemies, vulnerable to ‘Red,’ weren’t that threatening.
 </p>
 <p>
  No need to waste time, better to finish this quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan leaped into the abyss below the endless staircase.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rumble!
 </p>
 <p>
  [Descend step by step…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Give me death!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Lurking undead emerged from the trembling ground above.
 </p>
 <p>
  But he didn’t intend to confront them.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he descended, causing all the undead to rise, reaching the subterranean end,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  A crimson light emanated from Seong Jihan’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Follow the steps, walk down slowly.]𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka’s voice echoed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, Seong Jihan was back at the staircase entrance.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Winding back time to enforce the rule to descend the steps?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Return of the Light.
 </p>
 <p>
  Using a time-reversing power for such a trivial matter was ridiculous.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although amused,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He decided to comply with the directive.
 </p>
 <p>
  Step by step, descending slowly,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Finally… I die…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Burning the yearning-for-rest undead with Dragon Thunder,
 </p>
 <p>
  After descending countless steps,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Kill me too!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the undead struck by Dragon Thunder, some remained incomplete.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Red’ stat is insufficient.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Would you like to increase the ‘Red’ stat?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite their feebleness, inadequate ‘Red’ stat rendered them invincible.
 </p>
 <p>
  The system kindly suggested raising the stat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If it were that easy to raise…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan responded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rumble…!
 </p>
 <p>
  A segment of the stairway crumbled, revealing a small altar.
 </p>
 <p>
  An altar, red in hue, large enough for one person to lie upon.
 </p>
 <p>
  An emerging system message illuminated the altar.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Offer an ally as a sacrifice to gain abilities.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Suggested sacrifice: Yoon Seah]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Offering her will increase the ‘Red’ stat by 100.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Offering Yoon Seah as a sacrifice to gain 100 points in ‘Red?’
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you insane?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan saw the message and kicked the altar.

 <p>
  Chapter 382
 </p>
 <p>
  “Someone like me…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka’s eyes glinted with an eerie fervor.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You are astonishingly indifferent to your lifespan. Even though I warned you that using the void would cut short the lifespan of your human species, you prioritized completing the Taiji Sword.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Whether it’s a hundred years or a thousand years… does it really matter? I’ll be fighting the Martial God before then anyway. It’s better to gather strength no matter what.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at Ashoka as if he were making a fuss over nothing.
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s an enemy called the Martial God, and until he is defeated, it doesn’t matter whether it’s a hundred years or a thousand years.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather, this relentless pursuit of strength is more advantageous for survival.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But wasn’t there temptation for you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a natural instinct for living beings to want to continue living. Yet, you unhesitatingly draw from the void. Truly… with not an inch of hesitation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recalled a moment from earlier at those words.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Ashoka mentioned lifespan.
 </p>
 <p>
  It really hadn’t bothered him at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  This wasn’t just a one-time occurrence.
 </p>
 <p>
  When he first accepted the void, it was the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even afterward, whenever topics about lifespan came up, his thoughts were always the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What’s important is gathering strength right now, not how long my future self will live.’
 </p>
 <p>
  This perception was unwavering for Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Strength needs to be perfected to overcome the Martial God. I think it’s perfectly reasonable.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then why didn’t you take the easy path of sacrificing others to achieve power?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You mean the offering of sacrifices? That’s… not my style.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan responded, unknowingly picturing the various versions of himself within the Taiji’s Lost Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  How did they gain their strength to end up there?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hoo-hoo…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, Ashoka’s smile deepened at Seong Jihan’s answer.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ve passed both tests. You are the person I’ve been waiting for all this time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…The tests were the sacrifices and the void?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka, who had said to obtain the Red stat and come to him at the lowest floor, had other criteria to test.
 </p>
 <p>
  Would he stray down the unjust path for power and offer up humans as sacrifices?
 </p>
 <p>
  And would he show no regret at the moment he needed to forsake his lifespan for the completion of the sword?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan had passed both expectations set by Ashoka.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “The conditions to oppose the Martial God are sufficient… but there remains one final test.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Talent.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka extended a finger.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You must prove your talent in martial arts.”
 </p>
 <p>
  What?
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s ultimately the most important aspect, isn’t it?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the Taiji.
 </p>
 <p>
  The void within it was surging, almost ready to erupt.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Does drawing the sword from within the Taiji mean passing the final test?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. If you draw out the sword, not only will the throne be inherited to you, but further rewards will be granted. Just draw it out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed as if Ashoka was more eager for the completion of the Taiji Swordsmanship than even Seong Jihan himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ignoring Ashoka’s enthusiasm, Seong Jihan focused internally.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike Dongbang Sak, he knew he had to use the void as the sword’s material.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…It’s not easy.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if he had clues, completing the sword was an entirely different matter.
 </p>
 <p>
  The void, amplified by the half-mask, continued to pour into the Taiji.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some parts coalesced within, while others dissipated.
 </p>
 <p>
  As this process continued,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Void decreased by 5.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The void, which usually increased while using the mask, was now decreasing for the first time.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The void… is disappearing here?’
 </p>
 <p>
  This means there’s no longer any need to worry about the void threshold.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it rose too high, it could simply be eliminated within the Taiji of the Taiji Swordsmanship.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan realized its unexpected practicality, his eyes sparkled.
 </p>
 <p>
  But then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack…!
 </p>
 <p>
  A crack formed in the half-mask.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No way, a crack here…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Void Processing Mask made by the World Tree Alliance.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  Although it had been useful for amplifying his strength,
 </p>
 <p>
  How long had he owned it for it to already be like this?
 </p>
 <p>
  Sss…
 </p>
 <p>
  As the mask cracked, the flow of void grew unstable.
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching from below, Ashoka let out a regretful sigh.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Everything else was in place… but maybe you lack talent…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who had reached the pinnacle of humanity faster than anyone, frowned at the notion of lacking talent.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s quite an annoying comment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Stabilize the flow of void first.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Controlling the chaotic void within the fractured mask,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan continued to forge his sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Initially, he attempted to create a sword resembling the Eclipse Dark Sword, which he was most familiar with.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Maintaining a sword of that size is impossible with the current state.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Creating a sword the size of Eclipse was too challenging with the lack of void.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…I should complete it even if it’s small.’
 </p>
 <p>
  After all, Ashoka’s test was to draw a sword made from void within the Taiji.
 </p>
 <p>
  The form of the sword was irrelevant.
 </p>
 <p>
  How much time passed since Seong Jihan set his mind?
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The previously stable Taiji began to swell and destabilize again.
 </p>
 <p>
  A powerful energy seemed ready to erupt from within.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Is this the end?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Noticing this, Ashoka placed his hand on the Golden Wheel behind him.
 </p>
 <p>
  The wheel’s ends were golden skulls, where Ashoka began manually turning the wheel, which had been rotating automatically till now.
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly,
 </p>
 <p>
  Chiiik!
 </p>
 <p>
  Within the fluctuating Taiji, Seong Jihan drew something out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is that…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka’s hand, which was pushing the Golden Wheel, stopped.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… This is it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan pulled his hand from the Taiji.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  What he held was a handle of a sword emanating violet energy.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was so small that it didn’t even match the size of his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka, who silently watched, took a step forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  His body, which was on the deepest floor, suddenly appeared beside Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… it’s ambiguous.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ambiguous?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Your talent.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka, more serious than ever, examined the object Seong Jihan had drawn.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not talent that vastly exceeds your kind… yet it’s beyond the scale of humanity.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Talent that vastly exceeds the kind… was that the level of talent you were hoping for?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. I hoped for someone at least a notch below Dongbang Sak.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Is he saying Dongbang Sak is in the category that vastly exceeds standard talent?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I already knew he was a monster, but I didn’t anticipate his talent to be rated so highly.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan felt dumbfounded and asked Ashoka,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Am I disqualified then?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, let’s see…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka’s body leaped back to the deepest floor in a blink.
 </p>
 <p>
  So fast, even Seong Jihan’s eyes couldn’t follow.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The third disciple Ashoka… his talent seems significant too.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan closely watched Ashoka as he moved across space with a single step.
 </p>
 <p>
  The talent that vastly exceeds the species… could he have been referring to himself?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hold that item and come to me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With the violet sword handle in hand, Seong Jihan descended.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rumble…
 </p>
 <p>
  The Golden Wheel behind Ashoka moved a rotation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Up until now, the wheel would reverse time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sss…
 </p>
 <p>
  But as violet smoke rose from the sword handle,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh…”
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s body remained unaffected by the flow of time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rumble. Rumble.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Golden Wheel attempted to reset, turning several times automatically.
 </p>
 <p>
  But even when everything else was restored,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s position did not revert to the past.
 </p>
 <p>
  Without interference,
 </p>
 <p>
  Thump!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan easily landed on the deepest floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So close.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Ashoka rewound time, it seemed impossible to descend completely.
 </p>
 <p>
  But once blocked, reaching the bottom was quick.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I was definitely slower than when Ashoka descended earlier.’
 </p>
 <p>
  His movement that crossed space with a single step.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even for Seong Jihan, who could understand and learn all of humanity’s martial arts, this movement was mysterious.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not understanding it, he stood puzzled.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka looked at him with a complicated expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It actually works…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka continued observing Seong Jihan’s sword handle, lost in thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  After some contemplation, Ashoka opened his palm.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sss…
 </p>
 <p>
  A golden crown materialized in his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I promised you the throne.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He handed it over to Seong Jihan without hesitation.
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as the golden crown touched Seong Jihan’s hand, a message appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Inherited the throne from the constellation ‘Ashoka.’]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Inherited traits of Ashoka far surpass the player’s.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Constellation trait ‘Dominion’ level increases by 2.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Level 2…!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka’s Dominion level was reportedly at 8.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although he couldn’t fully inherit it, raising his Dominion level by 2 in his current state was a significant growth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “And the additional rewards and information… I cannot grant yet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not until the sword is drawn?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Indeed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka looked regretful as he stared at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “For greater rewards, I need to destroy the Golden Wheel myself… but I still lack complete faith in you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But if you overcome yourself in the abyss, my faith might grow.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Overcome oneself in the abyss?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was puzzled, but he widened his eyes as a realization hit him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Could he be referring to the Taiji’s Lost Soul in the abyss?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The ruler of the northern abyss.
 </p>
 <p>
  Within the Taiji’s Lost Soul were various fragments of Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka specifically mentioned overcoming oneself in the abyss, making it likely that he was referring to the Taiji’s Lost Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How do you know that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you overcome yourself, I will tell you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Huh. You seem to know everything. Are you really Ashoka?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ashoka is merely a facet of me. My essence is… a mere fool, wandering and lost.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A foolish existence.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet this being not only knew the void of the Taiji Sword but also the identity of the ruler of the abyss?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the Golden Wheel behind Ashoka.
 </p>
 <p>
  A device with the power to reverse time.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is it related to that…?’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan watched closely,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Golden Wheel suddenly disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  -What? The game ended without notice?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Even Seong Jihan won.
 </p>
 <p>
  -What just happened…?
 </p>
 <p>
  The chat began to flow.
 </p>
 <p>
  The blocked BattleTube had been unblocked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well then… I’ll look forward to good results.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka smiled faintly and bowed slightly to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  After the greeting,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  He vanished instantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…His true identity is unknown.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan stood there for a moment, staring at where Ashoka had disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’ve cleared the constellation game ‘Coronation Ceremony.’]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Logging out from the special map ‘Calamitous Flames.’]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan exited the game map.

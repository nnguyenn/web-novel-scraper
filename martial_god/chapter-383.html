  Chapter 383
 </p>
 <p>
  After the game ended.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This place…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan opened his eyes wide, seeing the brightened world.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike the usual return home after a game,
 </p>
 <p>
  The place he stood in was the space where he had chosen the constellations during the coronation ceremony just a while ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  The dark space where only the three constellations were illuminated by spotlights.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, devoid of the constellations’ presence, only the lights were shining down.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Back here again?
 </p>
 <p>
  – What’s even going on with this game?
 </p>
 <p>
  – I thought we’d see some grand battle with administrators appearing, but it feels like we got scammed…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Honestly, just watching the damn flames until the end lol
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers, who had expected an impressive battle at the coronation ceremony, were complaining about seeing nothing but the obstructing flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  At least the human viewers, owing to their bias towards Seong Jihan, refrained from overly criticizing him.
 </p>
 <p>
  – What kind of broadcast is this, after I finally tuned in ㅡㅡ
 </p>
 <p>
  – Even the administrators are a scam?
 </p>
 <p>
  – But how did they block the broadcast with flames? That level of interference should have been overcome…
 </p>
 <p>
  – I tried breaking through myself, but it didn’t work.
 </p>
 <p>
  – I’m unsubscribing.
 </p>
 <p>
  – I’m going to watch how the guy faking with administrators gets punished lol Seems like lower-tier species have brass guts.
 </p>
 <p>
  The extraterrestrial viewers, on the other hand, were in an uproar, declaring it a scam.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s a pity the viewers couldn’t watch, thus losing the 80% buff.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The heavily upgraded Star buff.
 </p>
 <p>
  When it was a mere 20% stat amplification, its absence was just a slight inconvenience.
 </p>
 <p>
  But with an 80% buff, the lack of it significantly impacted performance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Earlier, while attempting to complete the Taiji Sword, if only the buff had been active, he might have crafted more than just a sword handle, perhaps a full dagger.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Although it made sense for the meeting with Ashoka to be hidden… it would be problematic if BattleTube gets obstructed like this in future significant fights. I must find a solution.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan contemplated while watching the chat,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Void energy began to seep from the cracked half-mask.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’m still wearing it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Gently,
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan removed the mask,
 </p>
 <p>
  It floated up, leaving his hand and hovering mid-air.
 </p>
 <p>
  The cracks began to emit a dark light.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Is it repaired?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The cracks vanished, replaced by a black sheen.
 </p>
 <p>
  The mask then returned to his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  The darkness replacing the cracks continued to exude a palpable presence as Seong Jihan held it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Void energy has grown stronger.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The half-mask, which had always stored a considerable amount of Void energy, seemed to be even more potent after the repairs.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This means the Void won’t destabilize and hinder the creation of the Taiji sword again.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With the Void’s energy now even stronger, crafting the Taiji sword should be easier.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan examined the half-mask before storing it in his inventory,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The green manager says to the black manager in amazement, “I didn’t know you could repair that.”]
 </p>
 <p>
  A system window opened, revealing a message from the Green Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  – The Black Administrator repaired that…
 </p>
 <p>
  – This is definitely an admin impersonation scam. Does this even make sense? Isn’t that an item storing Void energy?
 </p>
 <p>
  – The pinnacle of Void actually fixed a Void-sealing item…?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Didn’t I say it was a scam? ㅡㅡ
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing this, the extraterrestrial viewers further burst out, expressing disbelief.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were already skeptical about the administrators’ involvement.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, with a broadcast obscured by flames and administrator messages conflicting with their knowledge, doubts about the show’s authenticity surged.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Green Administrator asks you what happened within the Calamitous Flames.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [They promise a huge reward if you consent to memory playback.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The administrators couldn’t see inside, it seemed, hence the Green Administrator proposed memory playback.
 </p>
 <p>
  Offering great rewards just to reveal the memory.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No.”
 </p>
 <p>
  How can I trust them?
 </p>

 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s trust in the Green Administrator was well below zero, already in the negatives, and he refused outright.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Rather… Why did they bring me back here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan inquired why he had been brought back,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The White Administrator makes a proposal to you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The White Administrator, who had persistently abstained from voting, made a proposal to Seong Jihan for the first time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Immediately,
 </p>
 <p>
  – The White Admin is actually making a proposal ㅡㅡ
 </p>
 <p>
  – Reporting admin impersonation.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Me too.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Haven’t reported yet??
 </p>
 <p>
  – I’m sticking around to see the scam artist get caught.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Hah… at least make it believable if you’re going to fake admin messages lol
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers, convinced the channel was tampered, were now certain.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike the temporally bound Green and Red Administrators, the White and Black Administrators had been present since the inception of BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  They rarely took the initiative and had become even more reclusive recently.
 </p>
 <p>
  Almost like supreme deities of BattleNet, the Black and White Administrators.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet the Black Administrator repaired some lower-tier species’ mask, and now the White Administrator was directly making proposals.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even for a doctored channel, this felt over the top.
 </p>
 <p>
  But,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The White Administrator offers to upgrade your BattleNet channel if you agree to install the ‘Eye of Light.’]
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Eye of Light…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [They also offer to transfer you to ‘Space-2 Area’ by administrator authority if you accept.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Space-2 Area.
 </p>
 <p>
  That was the area Seong Jihan couldn’t reach due to failing the humanity extinction mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  But they’d elevate him there just for accepting the installation?
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is the Eye of Light?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [He informs you that it is a device to permanently block channel obstructions like earlier.]
 </p>
 <p>
  If it’s that, he’d actually want it installed here immediately.
 </p>
 <p>
  Space-2 wasn’t of much interest, and the BattleNet channel upgrade didn’t particularly hit home.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the Eye of Light seemed like the perfect device to maintain the Star buff.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I accept.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Installing the Eye of Light…]
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan agreed, the installation of the Eye of Light commenced.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Eye of Light? Lol
 </p>
 <p>
  – The admin messages are way too fake.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Stop this and get caught already. Why are reports taking so long?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wait, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  – What, what’s this mark?
 </p>
 <p>
  – No way…
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers who were certain this was doctored saw the new white eye mark appear and fell silent.

 <p>
  Star of the Martial God, Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh, having exited the tower, was walking towards the place where the third disciple was sealed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you planning to do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak, closely trailing him, asked slowly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Didn’t he awaken recently? Just planning to have a chat among fellow constellations.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You seem to be in quite a hurry for just a chat.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m eager to meet him. But Dongbang Sak, how long do you plan to follow me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Annoyed, Gilgamesh glared at Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gently stroking his beard,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I shall observe until my master’s command has been fulfilled.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha… Is your life that idle? Come to think of it, you are the only one among the Martial God’s disciples classed as a Sole Sovereignty constellation. We Dominion constellations have matters to discuss, so please give us space.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But has he not transferred his constellation trait to Seong Jihan? Does he not lose his dominion trait then?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…No. He remains a constellation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How do you know?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “By continually tracking the number of constellations ruling a species.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh grimaced, his face showing he couldn’t quite comprehend.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s perplexing. The throne was supposedly inherited, yet he remains a constellation… Can traits be partially handed down?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I know not, for I lack the dominion trait.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… Surely his dominion level isn’t higher than 8.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Level 8… It is indeed high, but could it not be surpassed?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I am level 8.”
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

 <p>
  Gilgamesh pointed to himself in response to Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  “As the king of humans and the original existence, even I could only reach level 8 in dominion.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “And?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A later king surpassing me is unthinkable.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I hail from a later period than you, yet my Sole constellationty level is 9.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Level 9? Ho… you are more of a monstrous aberration than I thought.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Gilgamesh stared at Dongbang Sak in disbelief,
 </p>
 <p>
  “What brings you here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia, arms crossed, frowned at the pair.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Pythia, why are you here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have crucial business with Ashoka.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What a coincidence. I too have matters to discuss.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was here first.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “When did Tuseong start caring about first-come, first-served?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Showing no intention of yielding, Gilgamesh tried to step ahead of Pythia.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stop.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Crrrrack!Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  A massive ice wall surged from the ground, blocking his path.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh’s face contorted in anger.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Move aside, Pythia.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was about to say the same. Move back, Gilgamesh. Unless you want to be humiliated.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha… When did the prophetess grow so audacious?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh kicked the ice wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  Slowly…
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead of shattering, the wall bound and froze his foot.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What is this power?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I shall return it to you in kind. I received dominion power. And it’s quite useful.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You grew bold because you received it? Laughable.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack… crack…
 </p>
 <p>
  The ice cracked instantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh withdrew his foot and began to gather his power in earnest.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the Martial God’s disciples, the only one he hesitated to fight was Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was confident neither Pythia nor the third disciple were a match for him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially Pythia.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her authority was related to prophecy and detection, rendering her the weakest among the Martial God’s disciples.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had no concerns about her.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll teach you to understand rank properly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Tsk. How hard is it to wait your turn? An old fool with little inside that head.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…So bold just because you received a level 8 dominion?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course. Level 8 means I’m on par with you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Slowly…
 </p>
 <p>
  Fully gathering her power, Pythia did not back down from Gilgamesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  With her newly acquired dominion power at level 8,
 </p>
 <p>
  The power she could now wield was on an entirely different plane than before.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘At this level, she could fight Gilgamesh for quite a while. This might not end easily…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Calmly stroking his beard, Dongbang Sak observed the scene with a serene face.
 </p>
 <p>
  In any case, he could end the situation instantly if needed.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, he decided to let them have their confrontation, curious to see their power levels.
 </p>
 <p>
  But,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stop.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Crrrrack!
 </p>
 <p>
  Before the two could clash,
 </p>
 <p>
  The ground split open, and a giant form began to emerge.
 </p>
 <p>
  “M-Master…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…The Martial God, he awakened already?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The wandering Martial God, who had sealed the third disciple and briefly rested, appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  He addressed the three with a grave tone.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Far too many unexpected events have occurred this time…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “And?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Slowly…
 </p>
 <p>
  He turned around.
 </p>
 <p>
  Specifically, beyond the ice wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  Toward the land where the third disciple was sealed.
 </p>
 <p>

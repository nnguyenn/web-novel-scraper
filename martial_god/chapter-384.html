  Chapter 384
 </h3>

 </p>
 <p>
  Chapter 384
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Golden Wheel? What is that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh furrowed his brow.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though he didn’t fully understand its significance, a faint sense of unease crept over him instinctively.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This matter is unrelated to our contract. I have no obligation to explain it to you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God told Gilgamesh curtly.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ashoka, summon the Golden Wheel immediately.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God commanded again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Sssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka appeared from behind the ice wall created by Pythia.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a serene expression, he faced the Martial God and his disciples and began to speak slowly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That command… it’s difficult to execute immediately.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [What… are you defying my order?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “The gaze of the administrators is more vigilant than ever. If I hastily set the Golden Wheel in motion now, their intervention might lead to failure.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stop that nonsense. The more time passes, the more the administrators will focus on this place. Now is the perfect time. Ashoka. Spin it immediately. If you continue to refuse, I shall take matters into my own hands.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God’s eyes gleamed red, and a crimson aura surged from his body.
 </p>
 <p>
  When this aura connected with the armaments floating like stars above Tuseong,
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwaaah!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God’s power began to amplify significantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The armaments reverberated with a dark crimson light, amplifying the power of the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is…’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Gilgamesh tried to protest, seeing the armaments, he shut his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  He hadn’t placed those constellation armaments in the sky merely as a commemoration; they served as a direct means of enhancing his power.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…If he wields this much power, there’s no way I can win.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As humanity grew and thrived at the lower rank,
 </p>
 <p>
  He thought he could gather strength as a ruling constellation to eventually oppose the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, witnessing the current Martial God, he realized his judgment had been mistaken.
 </p>
 <p>
  If absorbing just a portion of the armaments provides this much power, then absorbing all the armaments in Tuseong…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I must find another way to defeat the Martial God…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Immersed in deeper contemplation as he saw another layer of the Martial God’s true power,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka, facing the swirling aura of the Martial God, nonchalantly looked up at the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you know? The stars of Tuseong… have not increased in number for some time now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Martial God. Though your plans have been effective so far, they have now reached a developmental plateau.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It is not a plateau yet.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “But at this pace, we would need to spin the Golden Wheel indefinitely… You realized the stagnation and thus aided humanity’s evolution, didn’t you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  […Indeed. And I realized that the administrators had only refrained from intervening because humanity was at the lowest rank. In truth, they have been closely watching this place.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The three administrators who appeared on Seong Jihan’s channel.
 </p>
 <p>
  Green was active and it wasn’t surprising for them to show up.
 </p>
 <p>
  But for the White and Black Administrators, it was extremely rare.
 </p>
 <p>
  Immediately after humanity became a lower-rank race, for them to show up?
 </p>
 <p>
  Though they outwardly claimed to be focusing on Seong Jihan,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The administrators’ attention is a formality; in reality, they aim to investigate Tuseong through Seong Jihan. They can’t officially investigate here without evidence.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You understand well. Thus, we must be cautious now. We must wait until their gaze shifts away.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Once an administrator begins observing, they do not stop. They will persistently scrutinize this place. Everything must be reset. We are not fully prepared yet.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Reset?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Reset?
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh caught an ominous term from the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  Spin the Golden Wheel.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus resetting everything…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…What does this mean? Could it be…’
 </p>

 <p>
  As Gilgamesh’s eyes darkened,
 </p>
 <p>
  “What if we make Seong Jihan, the eyes of the administrator, disappear?”
 </p>
 <p>
  […Eliminating him as a constellation candidate will only invite greater intervention.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What if we kill him after he becomes a constellation?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That was the initial plan. However, given the eye of the administrator bestowed upon him, there is no need to delay.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What if he dies not by our hands, but by a third party?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  In front of Ashoka, flames blazed.
 </p>
 <p>
  And within the radiant red flames, the form of a massive giant appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  With red eyes embedded all over its body, a giant with a violet hue.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite its violet body, its head was made of wood.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Abyss Owner. He will be the one to kill Seong Jihan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […He shall confront the Abyss Owner?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. His kin is held captive by the Abyss Owner. I also suggested that if he defeats the ruler, I would provide information about the Martial God.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […]
 </p>
 <p>
  Though Ashoka admitted selling his information, the Martial God’s aura became more composed than before.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Abyss Owner.
 </p>
 <p>
  Martial God was fully aware of his immense strength,
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how much Seong Jihan had grown, he could never defeat the Abyss Owner.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  The dark crimson light connected to the constellation’s armaments faded, reducing the Martial God’s power to its previous level.
 </p>
 <p>
  [So, he will die fighting the Abyss Owner…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “The eye of the administrator will vanish, making their intervention difficult. This time was unique with someone like Seong Jihan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka looked up at the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wouldn’t the stars of Tuseong increase again next time?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Risking danger for greater rewards, is that it?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Indeed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God stared at Ashoka with intense, gleaming eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though an overwhelming aura rose, making Gilgamesh shiver,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka remained composed, slightly bowing with a smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  […Very well. But only this time. Next time, I will not tolerate such insolence.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you for heeding my advice.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Though I wish to seal you again… it is not the time to waste power.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God’s form began fading.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Maintain silence as during your sealing.]Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  “I will.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You all, refrain from rash actions.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Glaring particularly at Gilgamesh, who frowned back at him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you planning to do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I will block the administrator’s surveillance.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Sss…
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God vanished entirely.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka quietly watched where he disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Time… bought.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The wandering Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  Suspicious and overcautious, despite his immense power.
 </p>
 <p>
  One who would use the time-reversing Golden Wheel over a minor variable.
 </p>
 <p>
  Convincing such a being succeeded only because his opponent was the Abyss Owner.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Will Seong Jihan surpass the Taiji’s Lost Souls?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Ambiguous.
 </p>
 <p>
  Recalling the Taiji sword drawn by Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though only the handle appeared, it showed potential.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…No. No one else has shown such potential. It will be hard for another to appear. This time, the end must be seen.’

 <p>
  As he contemplated deeply,
 </p>
 <p>
  Step. Step.
 </p>
 <p>
  Three disciples of the Martial God approached Ashoka.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The variable to assist Seong Jihan…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka’s eyes carefully observed them.
 </p>
 <p>
  The one captivating his attention was neither Pythia nor Dongbang Sak,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It shall be him.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh, whose morale waned after witnessing the Martial God’s strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  [Seong Jihan ascends to the Star League. Continuously treading an unprecedented path.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Alien astonishment at the administrator’s descent. ‘Eye of Light’ debunked the conspiracy theories.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Upgraded features of Seong Jihan’s channel? More options available for viewers.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Revealed three ruling constellations of humanity. Most surprising: Pythia.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A day since the Star League promotion match, ‘Coronation Ceremony’, ended,
 </p>
 <p>
  Interest surrounding the event remained fervent.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Aliens kept crying ‘fraud’, but shut up once the Eye of Light appeared LOL
 </p>
 <p>
  -Are the administrators really that incredible?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Aren’t they basically gods of BattleNet?
 </p>
 <p>
  -But didn’t BattleNet already have gods? Like the Thunder God before.
 </p>
 <p>
  -These administrators must be a tier higher, judging by the aliens’ fuss LOL
 </p>
 <p>
  Human viewers, less attuned to the administrators’ presence compared to aliens,
 </p>
 <p>
  Focused more on Seong Jihan’s channel changes and the ruling constellations of humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Did you see Seong Jihan’s channel? It’s sparkling white LOL
 </p>
 <p>
  -Eye of Light and channel options… but the changes don’t feel significant.
 </p>
 <p>
  -We’ll know once he starts streaming ㅇㅇ
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wasn’t it odd, the ruling constellations of humanity?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Calling Ashoka a king makes sense, but Pythia… isn’t she just a Greek prophet? A prophet ruling along kings, wow haha
 </p>
 <p>
  To viewers, Seong Jihan’s channel seemed only shinier with added features.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though the Eye of Light mark appeared on the screen, its impact was unclear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike viewers who felt minimal changes,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Why are there so many additional features?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned at the extensive new options on his BattleTube channel.
 </p>
 <p>
  He didn’t expect much from the upgrade,
 </p>
 <p>
  But the channel owner now had an overwhelming array of options.
 </p>
 <p>
  Trying to grasp the channel features,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…I’ll leave the detailed analysis to Hayeon.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Overwhelmed by the choices, he decided to pass on the task to the guild master.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What matters most is the Eye of Light.’
 </p>
 <p>
  During yesterday’s game, he had lost the Star buff due to viewer block.
 </p>
 <p>
  The absence of an 80% ability boost was a painful detriment during the Taiji Sword’s creation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Lack of martial talent may have also hindered the sword’s completion…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka had commented on his ambiguous talent.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though displeased at the time,
 </p>
 <p>
  A day later, Seong Jihan accepted this and sought solutions.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Without natural martial talent like Dongbang Sak, I must use every means to compensate for my deficiencies.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The straightforward method to enhance lacking talent would be training,
 </p>
 <p>
  But his immediate reality didn’t allow such luxury.
 </p>
 <p>
  Facing formidable opponents like the Abyss Owner, Dongbang Sak, and the Martial God,
 </p>
 <p>
  While training was essential, he also needed means to bridge the gap with such enemies.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Star buff is fundamental. I need to test if the Eye of Light prevents blocks like last time…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Wanting to experiment, he pondered ways to initiate channel interference.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan weighed his options,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Arena Master sends you a message.]
 </p>
 <p>
  -The Void Training Grounds have been fully repaired. Would you like to visit?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A suitable place for testing presented itself.

  Chapter 386

 <p>
  Chapter 386
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If the invitation has arrived… it’s already been 700 days.’
 </p>
 <p>
  700 days, almost equal to two years.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan let out a bitter laugh.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Dongbang Sak’s Heaven’s Chaotic Flow, I thought I’d break through it quickly when I entered the training grounds…’
 </p>
 <p>
  He had spent far more time than he had anticipated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, the gains from breaking through the skill were significant.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Martial Soul increased by 3.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan dismantled the Heaven’s Chaotic Flow, his Martial Soul, which rarely grew with regular martial arts training, had reached 450.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ordinarily, his Martial Soul barely rose through typical martial arts practice.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, dismantling the Heaven’s Chaotic Flow proved to be a sufficiently challenging training task to foster the growth of his Martial Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The increase in Martial Soul is welcome, but the Void has risen too much.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The upgraded Void Training Room.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ability to adjust the time ratio to 100 times was beneficial, but the Void’s energy seeped out regardless of the summoned map, gradually being absorbed by Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s a relief that it didn’t go beyond 200…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Once it hit 200, the Void Training Room’ energy no longer entered Seong Jihan’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, he could stay for 700 days without issue, but there was concern about future increases in Void energy.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to get out for now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He decided to think about future problems later.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan left the Void Training Room where he had stayed for 700 days.
 </p>
 <p>
  Returning to Earth,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The air feels different after so long.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He took a deep breath in his room before stepping outside.
 </p>
 <p>
  There, he found,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jihan! You’re back!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh. Uncle…! Are you back already?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah and Sophia, who had been chatting on the sofa, stood up to greet him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. I stayed a bit longer because the training wasn’t going well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I saw that 100x speed video during the streaming…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. It could only be adjusted after it was posted as a video.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, that’s because there’s a 100x time difference between the Void Training Room and here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Crunch.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan casually explained as he ate a snack from the table.
 </p>
 <p>
  The two quickly grasped the meaning and were astonished.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait, so you were there for a week… which means… you stayed for 700 days?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “700 days? How could you stay in that place for so long?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Didn’t realize it had been 700 days. The training wasn’t progressing, so time just flew by.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow… Uncle, you haven’t aged a bit. You look exactly the same.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What would change in just two years?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan chuckled and turned to Sophia.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sophia, have you heard anything from your constellation?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, about my constellation…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia’s face darkened as she continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jeanne d’Arc suddenly terminated her sponsorship and took back more than half of her Sacred Flame.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Sacred Flame too?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes… Apologizing for reclaiming her power, she enhanced my divine power instead. Because of that, the Sacred Flame buff’s effect is largely diminished.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Of the Martial God’s followers, Pythia had been the most cooperative towards Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Beginning with the unusual behavior at the coronation ceremony and continuing after the game,
 </p>
 <p>
  Her subsequent actions had been suspicious.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Still, she was quite helpful up until then.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Providing insider intelligence about Tuseong and locating the Nine Palaces Eight Trigrams Formation on the west coast—these accomplishments were thanks to her.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, since Ashoka’s appearance, her actions had become suspicious.
 </p>
 <p>
  Reflecting on this, Seong Jihan turned to Sophia.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you have some of the Sacred Flame left, may I see it again?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, yes. I’ll show you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  A white flame flared in Sophia’s hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was much weaker compared to what she had previously wielded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just a moment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan placed a finger into the flame to examine it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Wondered if the Sacred Flame was related to the red stat, but it doesn’t seem so.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sacred Flame was a blend of divine power and fire energy.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Despite its unique feeling, there was no obvious connection to the Red stat.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, the reason behind its recall remained unclear.
 </p>
 <p>
  After a while,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, I can’t maintain it any longer…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Fzzzz…
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sacred Flame in Sophia’s hand extinguished on its own.
 </p>
 <p>
  “With the Sacred Flame so weakened, the buff’s effect has significantly decreased. I even lost a match yesterday because the buff’s performance was so poor compared to usual.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “As the Sacred Flame’s buff was originally quite strong… it’ll take some time to adjust.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, about that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia looked up at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s an open sponsoring constellation slot. Will you be my constellation?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can’t provide the Sacred Flame.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s fine! I was so regretful when I couldn’t receive your support during humanity’s evolution mission… Lately, those receiving your support are boasting about their enhanced abilities!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Their abilities have improved? Ah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He remembered the coronation ceremony.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recalled the increase in his Dominion level, which he had forgotten amidst his training.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Although I’ve risen by 2 levels, with my constellation traits turned off, the tangible benefits to players should be minimal…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Checking the constellation menu for any new features,
 </p>
 <p>
  He found none.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Despite my increased ability, since I’m not an official constellation, the benefits to ordinary players should be negligible. Yet still, you wish for my support?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course! Benefits or not, I absolutely want to follow Constellation Seong Jihan!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sophia would want your support even if her stats decreased…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Absolutely!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing Sophia’s resolute desire for his backing, Seong Jihan nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright, let’s do it here and now. Support.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, the transfer of constellation support proceeded smoothly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow! It’s really done!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia rejoiced seeing Seong Jihan’s name under her supporting constellation on her status screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You don’t feel much difference, right? Even with me as your constellation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No! It feels great! I think I can rekindle the Sacred Flame!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Opening her palm again, Sophia concentrated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fzzzz…
 </p>
 <p>
  But only a wisp of white smoke rose from her hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s no need to strain yourself.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, just a moment!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Channeling her full power, Sophia’s hand trembled.
 </p>
 <p>
  After a while,
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle. Crackle.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sparks flew from her hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The flames began to burn once more.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh. It worked! Although the color is slightly red…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Though once purely white, now the Sacred Flame in Sophia’s hand carried a strong red hue.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan scrutinized it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…This time, I can sense some of the red’s energy.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With Seong Jihan as her constellation, Sophia’s flame faintly held the red’s energy.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the flame also contained a blend of various powers.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan tried to analyze further,
 </p>
 <p>
  [A special arena is about to begin.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Please open the invitation and respond to the summon.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A message indicating the start of the arena appeared before him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll have to continue examining the Sacred Flame later.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Was the red’s energy present because the constellation changed, or had it always been hidden?
 </p>
 <p>
  He decided to investigate after the arena.
 </p>
 <p>
  Opening his inventory, Seong Jihan took out the Arena invitation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s that golden ticket?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “An Arena invitation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Arena?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, I’ll be back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Before the words were fully out,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  Light enveloped the invitation, and Seong Jihan’s form vanished.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really? He could’ve rested a bit before going again…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing him dive into the Arena immediately after returning home, Yoon Seah looked worriedly at the spot where Seong Jihan had vanished.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sometimes, it seemed her uncle lived a life constantly on the run.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh…”
 </p>

 <p>
  She sighed and turned on the TV.
 </p>
 <p>
  “He’ll probably stream the Arena match on BattleTube, Sophia, want to watch?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sure.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As they predicted,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s channel promptly started broadcasting.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  [Welcome, players, to the Space Arena.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Having been summoned to the Arena, Seong Jihan first surveyed his surroundings.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Only the seating area is at the back.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Ahead and to the sides were open wastelands, with spectator seats only at the back—a peculiar map setup.
 </p>
 <p>
  In front of the seating area, three large crystals floated in mid-air.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Special Arena, ‘Boss Rush,’ is about to begin.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Prevent the enemies from reaching the crystals by defeating them.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The side that defeats more bosses wins.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash! Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the system message ended, a large screen appeared in the air, divided into twenty sections, each showing an identical arena to Seong Jihan’s.
 </p>
 <p>
  The only difference was the player standing before the spectator seats.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Competing against 20 players huh?’
 </p>
 <p>
  It resembled a defense mode in its setup.
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching the segments, Seong Jihan deduced as much.
 </p>
 <p>
  Defeating the bosses while protecting the crystals.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The concept is straightforward.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With his extensive BattleNet experience, Seong Jihan quickly grasped the game’s mechanics.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet he suspected the “special” tag indicated potential variables.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s see.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Opening the extraterrestrial chat,
 </p>
 <p>
  – This Boss Rush Arena, it’s been a while since we’ve seen it.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Isn’t this for constellation participants? How is a constellation candidate here?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Given that Seong Jihan held the coronation with a Ruling Constellation, he should qualify to participate.
 </p>
 <p>
  – So should we bet GP on this?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Betting on a candidate instead of a constellation…?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Even with admin interest, that’s an overestimation;
 </p>
 <p>
  – Lots of folks here lost money underestimating him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boss Rush, supposedly a game for constellation-level participants, permitted unrestricted betting, drawing viewers’ focus on where to place their GP.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bet on Seong Jihan, given his past favor with administrators?
 </p>
 <p>
  Or stick with the safer choice of constellations?
 </p>
 <p>
  While the debate initially raged,
 </p>
 <p>
  – Did you forget he’s from a lower-tier species?
 </p>
 <p>
  – How useful could his summoned players be?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Despite losing bets underestimating Seong Jihan, this game is different…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Constellations summon their subordinates to clear this map.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon, as Boss Rush’s gameplay was clarified, consensus shifted to avoiding bets on Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Constellations summon subordinates in this game?’
 </p>
 <p>
  An unfavorable situation indeed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The strongest among Seong Jihan’s sponsored players, Yoon Sejin, had just entered the Master League.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Constellations can summon their sponsored players here.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the system message, Seong Jihan considered his options.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Even if I summon them, few would be much help besides my brother-in-law.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Though his sponsored players were notable on Earth, they were inadequate for this constellation-level map.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Better not to summon anyone and risk dragging them down.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Evaluating his sponsored players cautiously,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ding!
 </p>
 <p>
  A new system message appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [General Quest]
 </p>
 <p>
  – Summon 5 or fewer sponsored players and reach Stage 3 of Boss Rush.
 </p>
 <p>
  Reward – 2 levels increase
 </p>
 <p>
  A quest to summon no more than five and reach Stage 3.
 </p>
 <p>
  And following this, successive general quests appeared:
 </p>
 <p>
  [General Quest]
 </p>
 <p>
  – Summon 5 or fewer sponsored players and reach Stage 10 of Boss Rush.
 </p>
 <p>
  The quests paused at Stage 10.
 </p>
 <p>
  Cumulative rewards for consecutive completion.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Two levels per quest, totaling sixteen levels by Stage 10.’
 </p>
 <p>
  So, this is why the Arena was described as a level-up haven?
 </p>
 <p>
  Given the limited viable players to summon, this worked to his advantage.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan decided to summon no more than five,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Epic Quest]
 </p>
 <p>
  – Clear Boss Rush alone.
 </p>
 <p>
  An Epic Quest appeared beneath the general quests.

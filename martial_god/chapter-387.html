  Chapter 387
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Clearing it solo, huh. This isn’t much of a restriction for me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Since he had planned to summon no more than five players for the general quests anyway.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether five or alone, the actual power would be more or less the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, one thing did concern him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The last general quest was to reach Stage 10, but the Epic Quest demands a clear completion.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Clearing the Boss Rush.
 </p>
 <p>
  How far did he have to go to achieve that?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the open extraterrestrial chat and spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This Boss Rush… how many stages does it have?”
 </p>
 <p>
  – There’s no end to the stages, I think?
 </p>
 <p>
  – The highest I’ve seen is Stage 14.
 </p>
 <p>
  – From Stage 6 onwards, the level of bosses is on a different scale…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Isn’t it just about outlasting your competitors?
 </p>
 <p>
  Extraterrestrial beings kindly responded to Seong Jihan’s question.
 </p>
 <p>
  By summing up their responses, it seemed that the last survivor among the 20 players would be the one to clear the Boss Rush.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Depending on the skill level of my competitors, it might end before Stage 10.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In that case, would the general quest be tougher?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought about it that way and examined the Epic Quest again.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘However, there’s no reward shown here. This wasn’t the case before.’
 </p>
 <p>
  While the general quests had level-up rewards.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Epic Quest didn’t have a rewards section at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  Previously received Epic Quests clearly had a rewards section, so this was peculiar.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan stared at the quest window for a moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Still, I should accept it for now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He pressed accept.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, Seong Jihan ended up with eight general quests and one Epic Quest.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this Boss Rush mission alone, he had a total of nine quests.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The 1st round will begin in 5 minutes.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Was it suggesting he summon the sponsoring players?
 </p>
 <p>
  There was a grace period of 5 minutes before the game began.
 </p>
 <p>
  And as soon as the message disappeared,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash! Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  On the screens showing the competitors’ arenas,
 </p>
 <p>
  The other players began summoning their forces without reservation.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Whoa… these competitors are summoning a lot of players.
 </p>
 <p>
  – It’s almost like an army.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Now I get why this map is so huge.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Seong Jihan has a lot of sponsors too, shouldn’t he summon his players?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Would they be helpful though? Hope they don’t just get in the way LOL
 </p>
 <p>
  – Better than nothing, I guess;
 </p>
 <p>
  Human viewers worriedly suggested that Seong Jihan summon players.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Owing to some circumstances, I’ll be going solo this time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan said calmly.
 </p>
 <p>
  – What?? Solo??
 </p>
 <p>
  – Are you kidding?? I put all my GP on you, though…??
 </p>
 <p>
  – Is he crazy? Betting everything on a constellation candidate LOL
 </p>
 <p>
  – Given he’s just a candidate, does he even have supporting players? He’s not an actual constellation.
 </p>
 <p>
  – No, this guy’s a bit different. He had supporting players too.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Then why not summon them?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Seriously, even if human players are subpar, throwing them out as meat shields could be beneficial…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Yeah, even a few seconds’ delay can change rankings.
 </p>
 <p>
  Extraterrestrial viewers, more agitated than the humans, reacted strongly to Seong Jihan’s answer.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed because they had betted GP, they were madly berating him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan glanced through the irate chat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come to think of it… is self-betting possible here? Where can I find it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ignoring the demands to summon supporting players, he showed interest in the betting option.
 </p>
 <p>
  – The game’s already started. It’s not possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  – You should have done it before the first round.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Check the arena section of the system. It might be different for participants.
 </p>
 <p>
  Following the feedback from extraterrestrial beings, Seong Jihan navigated the system’s arena section and found the betting option.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, it’s still available?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though he expected betting to be closed right before the first round, the arena’s betting option was still open.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan checked his odds.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Odds of 70 to 1… I’m ranked last.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Out of the 20 players, he proudly held the spot with the least likelihood of winning.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Seong Jihan has 70 to 1 odds?Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

 <p>
  – Wow LOL That’s practically nothing on Earth LOL
 </p>
 <p>
  – Extraterrestrials are raking it in, making money easily…
 </p>
 <p>
  – I wish I could bet on Seong Jihan… easiest way to make money.
 </p>
 <p>
  – This doesn’t show up on BattleNet betting sites.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Hurry up and implement arena betting lol
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon seeing the 70 to 1 odds, the viewers felt envious.
 </p>
 <p>
  Human viewers, having never failed a bet on Seong Jihan, found such an opportunity too valuable to miss.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Even though he’s a constellation candidate who can’t summon players, his odds are only 70 to 1? LOL
 </p>
 <p>
  – It’s all because the administrators showed interest. Normally, it should be 200 to 1.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Why can’t we adjust the bets? The first round hasn’t started!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Seong Jihan can bet GP, but adjustments aren’t allowed. That’s ridiculous…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Just bet on Seong Jihan already, let’s all fail together…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike humanity, who had unwavering faith in Seong Jihan, the extraterrestrial beings seemed certain of his defeat.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the suggestion to bet on himself, Seong Jihan chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You want me to bet on myself? Alright. Might as well multiply my GP a bit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He hadn’t needed to spend much of his accumulated GP lately.
 </p>
 <p>
  Leaving the minimum required GP aside, Seong Jihan placed the rest of his GP entirely on himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  While others continued summoning players and setting up defenses,
 </p>
 <p>
  He leisurely waited for the 5 minutes to pass, placing some bets instead.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Seriously, this is hopeless…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wow, look at all the Ruler constellations… Over 10 summoning more than 500 players.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Even Sovereign constellations aren’t alone; they summon around 50. Why’s this guy solo despite having Ruler status?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Didn’t he say there are circumstances? LOL
 </p>
 <p>
  As those betting on Seong Jihan began to sense imminent defeat,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The 1st round is about to begin.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The game commenced.
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  In the middle of Boss Rush,
 </p>
 <p>
  Standing before a colossal creature, Seong Jihan calmly spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Was it weak until Stage 5?”
 </p>
 <p>
  With one movement of his sword,
 </p>
 <p>
  Sssssizzz!
 </p>
 <p>
  The giant creature’s body ignited and quickly exploded in all directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then, a rising message.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have cleared the 5th round.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [General Quest ‘Boss Rush Stage 5’ completed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s really weak.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He leisurely stepped back, watching the creature’s body repeatedly explode.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wow… He won again?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Winning isn’t the issue. He’s wiping out bosses with a single strike;
 </p>
 <p>
  – Competitors are already down by three, but he’s playing a different game solo…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Seems like he gets stronger every time we see him…
 </p>
 <p>
  By the time the Boss Rush had reached Stage 5,
 </p>
 <p>
  The bosses that emerged were enormous enough to justify the vast map.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The 700 days of training weren’t in vain.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Having dismantled the Heaven’s Chaotic Flow, Seong Jihan’s Martial Soul shot up, allowing him to easily dispatch such opponents with basic martial arts.
 </p>
 <p>
  While competitors fought frantically alongside their summoned players,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow… looks like number 2 will be eliminated.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan crossed his legs and watched his opponents’ matches.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Look at his composure; finishing the game solo and now just lying there.
 </p>
 <p>
  – As expected!! I believed in him!! One who attracts the administrator’s attention is different!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Why didn’t you bet on Seong Jihan? Don’t you have eyes?? Do you have so much GP??
 </p>
 <p>
  – Those whining about bankruptcy a moment ago are suddenly acting all high and mighty LOL
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching Seong Jihan’s prowess, the extraterrestrials’ attitudes did a 180-degree turn.
 </p>
 <p>
  – But Stage 6 will be different.
 </p>
 <p>
  – That’s when the real challenge begins… just wait and see.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Regardless of what comes next, do you think those who couldn’t finish will die first, or will Seong Jihan lounging here die first?
 </p>
 <p>
  – No, since he has to protect the crystals, it’s actually a disadvantage for Seong Jihan who doesn’t have sacrificial players to throw.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Fine, just hand over your GP already.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Why can’t they finish so quickly?? Seong Jihan cleared it in seconds!!
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They seem more excited than I am.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching extraterrestrials betting on him cheer wildly, Seong Jihan chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether dealing with humans or aliens, greed made everyone act predictably.
 </p>
 <p>
  After solo-clearing Stage 5 and spectating the competitors’ attempts,
 </p>
 <p>
  BOOM! BOOM!
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s over now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing crystals shatter on other screens, he stood up.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Two more have been eliminated, so 14 are left.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With Seong Jihan included, 15 players remained in the Boss Rush.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

 <p>
  Already, a quarter had been eliminated.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stage 6 is about to begin.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [A powerful enemy appears.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Stage 6 started immediately.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shuuuu…
 </p>
 <p>
  Beyond the arena, a colossal violet vortex formed, from which massive currents of electricity rose.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, a message emerged above it.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stage 6 Boss, ‘Thunder God’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Thunder God?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the opponent labeled as Thunder God, Seong Jihan narrowed his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Isn’t he supposed to be gone?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Thunder God, who had resisted to protect his godly throne, was completely subdued by the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  His head alone had escaped, intending to reincarnate through Crimson Thunder.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the end, it had entrenched itself within Seong Jihan, trying to consume him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He exploded alongside the Ancient Elf… quite a helpful entity…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Recollecting the Ancient Elf, who sacrificed himself to assist, Seong Jihan reminisced.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sizz…
 </p>
 <p>
  But as electricity surged from afar, he glanced back.
 </p>
 <p>
  The currents consolidated to form a giant figure.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thump! Thump!
 </p>
 <p>
  The ‘Thunder God’ boss, an enormous lion amalgam of blue electricity and violet void energy, finally emerged from the vortex.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Another servant.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He noticed the opponent, a gigantic lion mixed with blue electricity and violet void energy.
 </p>
 <p>
  – No way… Thunder God at Stage 6?
 </p>
 <p>
  – They did say a powerful enemy, but this is excessive;
 </p>
 <p>
  – This might be dangerous.
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers tensed up at the emergence of the renowned Thunder God.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thump! Thump!
 </p>
 <p>
  The gigantic lion took steps towards Seong Jihan’s crystal, and then glanced down.
 </p>
 <p>
  The lion, seeing Seong Jihan, much weaker by comparison.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  [You… no way…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon seeing Seong Jihan, electricity erupted from the lion’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Se, Seong Jihan!!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [To meet you here!!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The massive lion, displaying extreme rage towards Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  From its reaction, Seong Jihan recognized the opponent.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re the Thunder God’s commander, right? How are you here? Weren’t you supposed to have exploded and died?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Because of you, I ended up here!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Because of me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  […I will kill you. Only you!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Thunder God’s commander, seething with rage at Seong Jihan,
 </p>
 <p>
  [ROARRR!!]
 </p>
 <p>
  BOOM!
 </p>
 <p>
  Countless bolts of lightning hurled towards Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whip!
 </p>
 <p>
  He extended the Phoenix Flag, absorbing all the thunderbolts.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Wha…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You know, I’ve grown a lot since you died. But you seem weaker.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Gr… Grrr…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Failing to contain his rage, the Thunder God released more electricity.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, his struggles meant little to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  The current Thunder God was far weaker than when he opposed the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stage 6 is nothing. Let’s end this quickly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yawning as he approached, Seong Jihan moved his blade.
 </p>
 <p>
  Szzzz…
 </p>
 <p>
  Each motion of the sword and spear caused chunks of the Thunder God’s body to vanish.
 </p>
 <p>
  [How… how are you this strong!?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “700 days of training will do that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [700 days… just that much? Are you mocking me…!?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s true.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  As his sword moved, the Thunder God’s body split apart.
 </p>
 <p>
  Facing imminent defeat shortly after emerging, he turned desperately towards the void.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Void…! I accept annihilation! Allow me one last full assault on this one!]
 </p>
 <p>
  He called out to the void, momentarily pausing it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do you accept the Thunder God’s proposal?]
 </p>
 <p>
  A violet message window appeared before Seong Jihan.

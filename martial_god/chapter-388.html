 <p>
  Chapter 388
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A purple message window… Is this sent from the Void?’
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed that the Thunder God would need consent to fully manifest.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gazing at the message window before him, Seong Jihan spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve bet everything I have on this… Should I really take this risk?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ha, are you scared?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle!
 </p>
 <p>
  At that taunt, the Phoenix Flag swiftly left Seong Jihan’s hand, aiming directly at the giant lion’s torso.
 </p>
 <p>
  [What, what is this…? It’s not even the Crimson Thunder…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even if you come in your true form, it will only bring you disgrace. Isn’t it better to die here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Vo-Void… What are you doing! Allow my true form to manifest! I swear on the name of the Thunder God that once I kill him, I will embrace annihilation!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even if you kill me here, it’s just a game, and I’ll return unscathed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hmph… of course, I know that. Still, I want to kill you. Because of you, I was dragged into the Void…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the lion’s rage, Seong Jihan smirked.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Thunder God had fallen because the Wandering Martial God had invaded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unable to retaliate against him, the lion took out its anger on Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do you accept the Thunder God’s proposal?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, once again, a purple message window appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What will I get if I let him come in his true form?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Already feeling uneasy about the lack of reward information for the Epic Quest, Seong Jihan couldn’t simply accept this without knowing the rewards.
 </p>
 <p>
  In response to his query, additional information appeared at the bottom of the message.
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you accept the Thunder God’s proposal, you will be granted 2 Racial Bonuses.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Moreover, if you subdue the Thunder God, you will receive 2 additional Racial Bonuses.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Just summoning him granted 2 race bonuses, and defeating him would add up to a total of 4.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Now that I think about it, the arena often gives a lot of race bonuses.’
 </p>
 <p>
  This didn’t seem like a bad deal.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Race bonuses, huh… Alright, summon him.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon Seong Jihan’s approval,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoooosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The purple vortex expanded greatly.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Thunder God’ is concentrating on Player Seong Jihan’s arena.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle!
 </p>
 <p>
  Thousands upon thousands of lightning bolts began to enhance the lion’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  Simultaneously,
 </p>
 <p>
  – Uh, wait… the Thunder God vanished on the other side?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Looks like he’s concentrating here…
 </p>
 <p>
  In the other arenas where players were struggling against the Thunder God, the boss suddenly disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  For those competitors, it meant clearing Stage 6 for free.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing!!
 </p>
 <p>
  – You were in an overwhelming lead, and now you’re picking a fight with the Thunder God??
 </p>
 <p>
  – Looks like he’s getting race bonuses? Then the rewards aren’t bad…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Race bonus? Didn’t Seong Jihan also bet on himself? Is he giving up GP to upgrade humanity, a low-tier race??
 </p>
 <p>
  – Maybe he didn’t bet much GP. If he’s sure he’ll get race bonuses, that’s more valuable, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  “I bet everything I had.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan retorted to the chat, causing the extraterrestrials who had bet on him to erupt in chaos.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile,
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wow, gave up all his wealth for the race bonuses? Unbelievable…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Seriously… How far will he go to take care of humanity…
 </p>
 <p>
  – We should build statues of him in every capital.
 </p>
 <p>
  – LMAO! With extended lifespans and better health, humanity’s now in the upper echelons.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Not just statues. Countries should reimburse his lost GP too.
 </p>
 <p>
  Human viewers, convinced that Seong Jihan gave up everything for race bonuses, began to praise him.
 </p>
 <p>
  The notion of reimbursing his lost GP even became a trending opinion.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t understand why everyone thinks I will lose,”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan muttered while reading the chat, shaking his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Of course they think so!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle…
 </p>
 <p>
  The giant lion, the Thunder God, shone brightly as electricity surged through its body.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the 19 split entities now merged, the Thunder God’s form was so vast and spectacular that it could obscure the entire purple vortex.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  It resembled not just a game’s ‘boss’ but a tremendous natural calamity.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Now that I, The Thunder God has regained my true strength, who would think you stand a chance!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle, crackle…
 </p>
 <p>
  The lion sparkled with intense electricity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet parts of its body, especially where the void energy had penetrated, weren’t uniform in color, appearing like large spots on its form.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Race Bonuses will be granted to humanity after the game concludes.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As if the Thunder God’s full power was realized, a message confirming race bonuses appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Isn’t this at least past Stage 10…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Probably. The Thunder God is a powerful constellation.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Judging by the state, it hasn’t fully succumbed to the Void yet; only spots are marked.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Doesn’t entering the Void mean certain death? How is this god different?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Recognized gods require a maturation process in the Void since they’re granted immortality by BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ah… So pledging self-annihilation is why they’re giving race bonuses.
 </p>
 <p>
  The extraterrestrials, actively analyzing the Thunder God, provided useful insights.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan glanced back at the lion, his mind racing.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The void-infused parts must be the Thunder God’s weakness.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The lion’s electricity stuttered unnaturally around the void spots.
 </p>
 <p>
  Its power would have been greater if not for these void spots.
 </p>
 <p>
  While he was carefully observing,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Finally… I will kill you!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle!
 </p>
 <p>
  Electricity surged endlessly from the lion’s body, painting the vast map white with overwhelming power.
 </p>
 <p>
  [As expected of the Thunder God… Even if I regain my former strength, he’s still formidable.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Shadow Queen within Eclipse evaluated the Thunder God’s power, realizing that even she, who had reached Dominion Level 7, would find him challenging.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Thunder God, having partially reclaimed his full strength from the Void, was immensely formidable.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to go all out.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [Constellation reaching level has been reduced to Level 759.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan activated Constellation Traits, amplifying his power with the half-mask, but he knew that in a direct power struggle, handling the Thunder God’s lightning wasn’t straightforward.
 </p>
 <p>
  A special approach was necessary to block the Thunder God’s attacks.
 </p>
 <p>
  Firstly, the idea of using the first stage of Taiji Swordsmanship, the Taiji itself, came to mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can’t summon the Taiji sword here; let’s use the Dark Soul Vortex instead.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With the live BattleTube broadcast ongoing, revealing the Taiji Sword was too risky.
 </p>
 <p>
  Harnessing the powers of,
 </p>
 <p>
  Fundamental Divine Arts,
 </p>
 <p>
  Dark Shadow Technique:
 </p>
 <p>
  Dark Soul Vortex
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s sword Eclipse started swirling, absorbing the Thunder God’s strikes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though the vortex was dwarfed by the world-engulfing lightning, it effectively shielded Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes! Resist! Dying too quickly wouldn’t be fun!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing Seong Jihan’s countermeasure, the Thunder God was rather pleased.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle…!
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  He poured more power into his strikes, attempting to break through the vortex.
 </p>
 <p>
  – This is overwhelming…
 </p>
 <p>
  – The Thunder God is a powerful constellation, But he’s actually weakened now compared to his prime.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Curses! Betraying us for race bonuses… I’ll never forgive you, Seong Jihan!
 </p>
 <p>
  – If he earns those bonuses, it’s worth it. You can’t buy those with GP.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though Seong Jihan held his ground, from a third-party perspective, the Thunder God appeared dominant.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoooosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  While it seemed the Dark Soul Vortex might be overwhelmed by the lightning waves, it instead started to grow.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Thunder God’s electricity was increasingly being absorbed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Step. Step.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the Dark Soul Vortex as a shield, Seong Jihan advanced slowly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing this, the Thunder God growled.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’re quite resilient.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Didn’t you say it’d be boring if I died too quickly?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Though Seong Jihan’s words carried ease, inwardly, he assessed the situation coldly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Without the Heaven’s Chaotic Flow training, I’d have been overwhelmed by now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite outward composure, he knew the limits were near.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unable to directly reveal the Taiji Sword, he substituted with the Dark Soul Vortex, which had absorbed beyond his manageable amount of energy.
 </p>

 <p>
  ‘I need to cleanse the interior once.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Electricity surged wildly within the vortex; left unchecked, it might backfire and incinerate him instantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he prepared to stabilize the vortex,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Void increased by 1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Surpassing the Void limit. Player’s body might succumb to the Void.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Having stayed at 200 for 700 days without further increase, now his Void had risen by 1 since activating the half-mask, issuing a warning.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed unlikely to immediately succumb, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to lower it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He decided to control the rising Void.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘As with summoning the Taiji Sword, directing the Void internally should decrease the levels.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Though he’d only managed to summon the handle of the Taiji Sword at the second stage, his experience led him to strategies to reduce the Void.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swooosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Inserting Eclipse into the vortex pulsing with electricity,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Infuse the Void to strengthen the sword.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He poured the Void into the vortex.
 </p>
 <p>
  [What, what are you doing…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hang on a bit. I’ll reinforce you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Reinforce? It’s causing internal Void explosions…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “This will make you stronger.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Save me…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Ignoring the plea of the Shadow Queen, Seong Jihan infused the Void.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Void decreases by 5.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A message indicating the Void’s reduction appeared, and he felt strength focusing into the sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Partially succeeded.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dark Soul Vortex had more room due to the Void explosion, and Eclipse began to mimic the Taiji Sword somewhat.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was time to confront directly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You, your goal is to swallow the sun with your sword, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  […Yes.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then you should be able to swallow a lion struck by lightning.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoooosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Dark Sword Eclipse emerged from the vortex.
 </p>
 <p>
  Concentrated Void energy exploded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fundamental Divine Arts,
 </p>
 <p>
  Dark Shadow Technique:
 </p>
 <p>
  Shadow Divine Blade
 </p>
 <p>
  Whooosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Darkness spread swiftly from the sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  [What is this…!]Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  Though the Thunder God sparked fervently, the darkness cloaked his light.
 </p>
 <p>
  The void-infused spots on the Thunder God’s body resonated with the darkness.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Why… is this Void reacting like this…?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “A Thunder God who can’t even manage his body… pathetic.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [This can’t be! I didn’t exert full power… No…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s end this. Just die.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whooooo…
 </p>
 <p>
  The Void engulfed the Thunder God completely.
 </p>
 <p>
  His desperate struggles were soon shrouded in darkness.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Thunder God has been subdued.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [2 additional Race Bonuses granted.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A message confirmed the victory.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking at the Thunder God hidden in darkness, Seong Jihan shrugged.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It wasn’t much of a challenge, was it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whooooo…
 </p>
 <p>
  The Void vortex began to spin rapidly.
 </p>
 <p>
  It soon absorbed the darkness of the Shadow Divine Sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Black Administrator expresses satisfaction with your sword.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [In his authority, he will summon a special boss monster for only you in the next round.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A message emerged from the void.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If satisfied, reward better… Why summon a special monster?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Initially disgruntled by the message,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Special Boss, ‘Red Administrator’s Hand’ will appear.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon seeing the name of the next boss monster, Seong Jihan blinked.

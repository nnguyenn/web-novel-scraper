  Chapter 389
 </p>
 <p>
  – The Red Administrator…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Why is that guy’s hand here?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wow, what’s happening now?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Is this channel a special feature of administrators?
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as the name of the special boss appeared on BattleTube, the chat from extraterrestrial viewers exploded.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite his term ending, he had not relinquished his position and had gone into hiding.
 </p>
 <p>
  And.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘An administrator who seems linked to both the Martial God and Ashoka in some way…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Initially, even those who had limited humanity were part of the Red’s Tribe.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But if only his hand is remaining, it might’ve been cut off while he was fleeing and buried in the void.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan observed the front while crossing his arms.
 </p>
 <p>
  The vortex of the void gradually turned black.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwooooosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  From within, a burning hand emerged.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s clenched in a fist.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Though the size of the hand was slightly larger than Seong Jihan, it was far less imposing compared to the overwhelming figure of the Thunder God.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite its appearance, Seong Jihan remained cautious as he slowly approached the Red Administrator’s hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  The hand had a peculiar texture, as if mixing human features with those of a reptile.
 </p>
 <p>
  Scaly structures stood out prominently, blazing on the back of the hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  – That’s the hand of an administrator? Doesn’t seem like much.
 </p>
 <p>
  – The Red Administrator originally came from a giant race. Of course, after the administrators appeared, they renamed their species the Red’s Tribe.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ah, I see…
 </p>
 <p>
  – If it’s staying still like that, can’t he just attack and clear this mission too?
 </p>
 <p>
  – As if beating an administrator’s hand is that simple…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Still, it’s too quiet.
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers speculated as the seemingly lifeless, clenched hand did not move.
 </p>
 <p>
  But.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan got closer to the Red Hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  A light flickered on the back of the hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  From there, characters emerged.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though it wasn’t any recognizable language, Seong Jihan could read the characters.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Red.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as the letter emerged, the hand opened out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the scarlet palm, hundreds of eyes were embedded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Initially unfocused and dazed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Target.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Wriggle. Wriggle.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the eyes moved, they collectively fixed their gaze on Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  The numerous red eyeballs, brimming with life, trembled.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ew! What is that??
 </p>
 <p>
  – Even with just a hand remaining, it’s that powerful… it’s definitely an administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  – To instill fear even through the screen…
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers who had earlier downplayed the hand’s significance felt an overwhelming sense of intimidation just by looking at the eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Why are these seasoned fighters scared of such a gaze?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite facing the eyes directly, Seong Jihan didn’t flinch.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s begin the inspection.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Step. Step.
 </p>
 <p>
  He walked toward the outstretched hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he approached, the eyes focused increasingly on him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flames danced across the hand, then letters appeared again.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Why am I here? The Black wouldn’t have released me.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who knows.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ah, got it. You are the bait.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The red hand continued to answer its own questions, causing Seong Jihan to frown at the word “bait.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Bait needed. Found the main body’s location. If known, no bait needed. Currently in process of finding.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The hand spoke in disjointed phrases, but Seong Jihan could roughly understand its meaning.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Black Administrator had summoned the hand as a special boss intending to use Seong Jihan as bait.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is he trying to lure out the Red Administrator through me?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator, who had vanished long ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, his traces remained scattered on Earth, and recently, connections with the Martial God and Ashoka had surfaced.
 </p>
 <p>
  As administrators were the absolute figures of BattleNet, they surely wouldn’t be oblivious to this information.
 </p>
 <p>
  Caught in the midst of the administrators’ schemes, Seong Jihan felt like a pawn in their grand game.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The one universal truth in BattleNet is that no one here is trustworthy. The administrators may seem friendly now, but they all have their own agendas using me as a means to an end.’

 <p>
  Remaining ever vigilant in observing the situation is essential.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan mused,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Detected. Playing along with intent. Main body needs my power. Bait will be tempting.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, flames surged from the Red Hand, extending towards Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan quickly dodged the flames, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  Hiss…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The tail end of the flames grazed his cheek.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Even with all my buffs, I couldn’t avoid it… so this is the power of an administrator’s flame.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [Constellation reaching level drops to Level 758.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite having activated the Constellation Traits and wearing the mask, he still couldn’t fully evade the small flame.
 </p>
 <p>
  Certainly, this special boss was formidable.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan took a cautious step back, keeping his guard up.
 </p>
 <p>
  [? Bait. Why dodge. Fulfill your role.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “And become a sitting duck?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan retorted upon reading the altered letters.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The flame that had scorched his cheek rose momentarily before dying out.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stat Red increases by 2.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As a message displayed the stat increase, Seong Jihan hesitated.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Raised by 2 just from a brief touch?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red stat, challenging to increase, had risen by 2 from just a tiny flame.
 </p>
 <p>
  What would happen if he absorbed the entire flame?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Should I consider playing the bait?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan briefly considered it.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Resistance pointless. Will switch bodies. Will become bait.]
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the message promising to take over his body made him draw his weapon.
 </p>
 <p>
  Letting his body absorb the flames for the stat increase risked conceding control to another entity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Futile defiance.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The hundreds of eyes merged into one large eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  The eye emitted light, creating letters.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stop.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Next to this command, another set of letters appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That’s… a domination code.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Designed to enforce control through his language.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘My body’s moving fine.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The command to stop had no restrictive power over Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Will consume.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Convinced he had halted, the Red Hand began to extend the flames slowly, contrary to the previous rapid surge.
 </p>
 <p>
  The flames expanded outward, forming a wide ring to encircle Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Why is he staying still?
 </p>
 <p>
  – As expected, you can’t defy an administrator’s power.
 </p>
 <p>
  – It’s the Red Hand. Defiance is futile.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Shouldn’t we get refunds?? He even beat the Thunder God, but now an administrator’s hand appears? I bet so much money, but the Arena is playing tricks like this?
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan stood still, angry bettors momentarily rioted.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Oh! I just checked, they’re acknowledging it on Arena and giving automatic wins for the special boss appearance.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Really? Recognized as 1st place?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Yeah, win or lose, bettors on Seong Jihan get their GP.
 </p>
 <p>
  – So we win?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Nice! Seong Jihan, handle the Red case however you want. Made some good money!!
 </p>
 <p>
  The guaranteed refund by Arena turned the sentiments of bettors.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Gamblers will be gamblers… Looks like I made 70 times my GP too.’
 </p>
 <p>
  GP obsession transcends species and is a universal truth across the cosmos.
 </p>
 <p>
  Taking his eyes off the gamblers, Seong Jihan watched his opponent.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Hand, encircling him in flames, seemingly ready to consume him in one go.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Retaliation was always an option.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Striking a distracted enemy had always been easy for him.
 </p>
 <p>
  But he had decided to wait, considering the previously increased stat.
 </p>
 <p>
  Raising the Red by 2 from mere contact.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Need to extract maximum benefit without getting dominated.’
 </p>
 <p>
  After some time, Seong Jihan saw his chance.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  The red flames completely encircled him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Expending a lot of power to create the circle, the flames within the Red Hand weakened.
 </p>
 <p>
  Furthermore, the large, merged eye had significantly dimmed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is sufficient.’

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan re-activated the Dark Soul Vortex.
 </p>
 <p>
  [?? Bait? How?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Questioning, the hand watched as Seong Jihan continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  Disregarding the message, he thrust Eclipse into the Dark Soul Vortex again.
 </p>
 <p>
  […Trying that again?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Didn’t it work well earlier?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [There was something to learn from your sword…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then let’s learn again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Immediately after the Shadow Queen finished speaking, Seong Jihan caused the void within the vortex to explode.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Void decreases by 5.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the void message appeared, the sword took shape, and he withdrew the blade from the vortex.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fundamental Divine Arts,
 </p>
 <p>
  Dark Shadow Technique:
 </p>
 <p>
  Shadow Divine Blade
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon witnessing the Shadow Divine Blade, which had dispatched the Thunder God in one move,
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s…! The void’s core…]
 </p>
 <p>
  The once still eye now trembled in surprise.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’re not bait, but the Black’s blade…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The red hand began to touch the erupting darkness.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, unlike the Thunder God who had been entirely engulfed,
 </p>
 <p>
  Sizzle…
 </p>
 <p>
  The hand resisted, emitting smoke as the darkness contacted it.
 </p>
 <p>
  [No, it’s different. Weaker than the Black’s blade.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s the Black’s blade?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’re imitating an administrator’s blade and don’t know?]
 </p>
 <p>
  This is imitating an administrator’s blade?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan blinked.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was an alternative he created as he couldn’t reveal Dongbang Sak’s Taiji Sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh. I didn’t know.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [So, did you craft this yourself?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not entirely original; I adapted it from something learnt.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […A lie? But some truth. Not strong enough for void’s proxy…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Psfffff…
 </p>
 <p>
  The flames around the hand weakened.
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you were the void’s proxy, resistance would be futile. On the contrary, to protect my true form, acceptance might be wise. Bait, however…]
 </p>
 <p>
  The eyes kept rotating, continuing to draft letters.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your blade is a vital talent for my true form.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I told you, I didn’t craft it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Realizing is talent.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan smirked.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka often criticized his ambiguous talents, and now even the Red Hand deemed it valuable.
 </p>
 <p>
  Regardless, flattery meant little now.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Time to end this.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Without the domination code’s failure, the Red Hand would overpower him.
 </p>
 <p>
  He needed to finish it while still in a superior position.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan poured more power into the Shadow Divine Blade,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Close but not quite the Black’s. Definitely bait.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Moreover, a vital bait for my true form.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Resistance diminishing, the hand finally accepted Seong Jihan as bait.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Enough with the bait talk.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Such talk was unpleasant.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he intensified the dark power, the Red Hand’s defenses significantly weakened.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Decision.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The hand caught fire and vanished.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud…
 </p>
 <p>
  Leaving behind a single eye, significantly reduced in size, on the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  Originally enormous, now human-sized.
 </p>
 <p>
  [If consumed, talent might be lost.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Thus, will be eaten instead.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The eye’s message read.
 </p>
 <p>
  Changing plans from consuming Seong Jihan to offering itself.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Eat you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. Eat me.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The red eye squirmed vilely, expanding blood vessels.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eating a living octopus seemed more appealing.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Should I just crush it?’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan contemplated,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Minimum Red increased by 500.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The eye provided an added incentive.

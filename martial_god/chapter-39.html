   Chapter 39

 </p>
 <p>
  In a BBQ restaurant in Gangnam.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a private room of the restaurant, Seong Jihan shook hands with a man.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nice to meet you again, Seong Jihan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It was Diego Masied, whom he had befriended in the Defense Game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan had long wanted to meet Diego, who possessed an SSS-grade Gift, but due to his busy schedule, they could only meet today, which was a public holiday.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I originally planned to watch a Korea-Japan match with Seah.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The meeting was only possible because Yoon Seah was attending an academy due to her Gift.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sorry I’m late today. Living expenses in Korea are high, and my soccer classes aren’t enough to cover them, so I had to take on a part-time job.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You were running soccer classes?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. It’s a place run by my sponsor, Mr. Cha. It used to have many students, but soccer’s popularity has declined, so there aren’t many students now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan felt a pang of empathy.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Diego Masied, once on the path to becoming a soccer legend… now teaches soccer in Korea.’
 </p>
 <p>
  After BattleNet caused professional sports to disappear, Diego Masied was one of the most affected individuals.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was on his way to becoming a legend in soccer, which was the world’s most popular sport, being from one of the top clubs. But now, he had fallen to a point where he had to worry about daily living.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can’t even remember the last time I had beef.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Tshh!
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as the ordered meat arrived, Masied immediately placed it on the grill.
 </p>
 <p>
  He sneakily glanced at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can we drink alcohol?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as he got permission, Masied shouted loudly,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ma’am! Soju and beer! Please!”
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Whirl! Thud! Glug-glug!
 </p>
 <p>
  With experienced hands, Diego Masied mixed soju and beer with a 1:2 ratio.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a mix preferred by genuine alcohol enthusiasts.
 </p>
 <p>
  After preparing the drink with care, he offered it to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Cheers?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Cheers.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Clink!
 </p>
 <p>
  The only time Masied seemed truly happy was when drinking this mix.
 </p>
 <p>
  He nostalgically looked at the empty glass, then started pouring again.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s have another round.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sure.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Speak comfortably. I find casual speech easier to understand than formal.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!
 </p>
 <p>
  The two men drank straight shots without speaking.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels
 </p>
 <p>
  With a slightly flushed face, Masied stared at the empty beer glass.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, how much do you know about me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I know you were once considered a living legend.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Legend, huh? Feels like a long time ago.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a distant look, Masied poured more alcohol.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gulp! Gulp!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ma’am-! Two bottles of soju and four beers, please.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After that, Masied went silent.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recalled the information he had researched before meeting him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Diego Masied, rising as a living legend from a prestigious club in Spain.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sudden appearance of BattleNet crushed him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘FIFA disbanded in 2013.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The International Soccer Association, FIFA.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">

   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Even that massive organization disbanded in less than three years after BattleNet arrived.
 </p>
 <p>
  And it was one of the last professional sports organizations to do so.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the dissolution of FIFA, professional sports worldwide ceased to exist, with only BattleNet remaining.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Diego Masied had already finished a bottle of soju and two bottles of beer from the additional order.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a flushed face, he looked at Seong Jihan and said, “Alright, Seong Jihan. Let’s get to the ball game.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What ball game? Slow down with the drinking.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Main. Topic. Korean is hard. Also, you’re supposed to drink when alcohol is served.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Stuttering, Masied asked Seong Jihan, “Tell me. Why does my Gift… match with a Mage?”
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, Masied started juggling a soccer ball with his feet.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even while sitting in a drinking place, his skills with the ball were impeccable, as if the ball was an extension of his body.
 </p>
 <p>
  Masied even entered the restaurant without letting the ball leave his feet.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s with him? Is he crazy?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why bring a soccer ball here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the glares from the people around, Masied never let the ball leave his feet.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if he was a legendary figure in soccer and missed his past glories, this obsessive behaviour seemed excessive.
 </p>
 <p>
  But there was a reason for it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s because of his Gift.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Gift named ‘God of Soccer’ that Masied publicly revealed for sponsorship had the following abilities:
 </p>
 <p>
  [Gift – God of Soccer (Rank SSS)]
 </p>
 <p>
  [While keeping a soccer ball at your feet, all abilities significantly increase.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Soccer ball-shaped’ equipment’s effect increases by 300%.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The longer you handle the ‘soccer ball-shaped’ equipment, the greater the increase in abilities.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A Gift inseparable from a soccer ball.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially due to the last condition, Masied always had to live with a soccer ball.
 </p>
 <p>
  Be it in the game or reality.
 </p>
 <p>
  To continue benefiting from the increase in abilities from his Gift, he had to always have the soccer ball with him.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  “My abilities… don’t match with a Mage.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you referring to your initial stats?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. My strength, agility, and stamina were 10, but… my magical power was only 5.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In BattleNet, initial stats indicated the suitable profession for the player.
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering Masied’s superior physical abilities contrasted with his low magic stat, it was credible when he said he wasn’t suited to be a Mage.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hence, Masied had only considered adapting to the Warrior or Archer classes and hadn’t even thought about choosing the Mage class with his low magic power.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I lived as a Warrior for 3 years. I reached the silver rank but found it too inconvenient to fight while keeping the soccer ball with me. So, I gave up on that class.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Masied filled his glass again, looking somber.
 </p>
 <p>
  “To give up, I downgraded to level 2. I kept dying, finishing last… and continued to fall… then I changed my class to Archer. But that too was tough. No matter how much my abilities improved, I couldn’t break through the enemies with a soccer ball.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right. A ball is just a ball. Not suitable as a weapon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I even tried shooting arrows with the ball attached to my feet. It wasn’t effective. I tried various methods. In the process, I got scammed multiple times. My wealth gradually disappeared. I slowly descended into misery.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Masied, seemingly lost in his thoughts, drank heavily without even touching the meat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “My wife couldn’t take it anymore and left me. She took our son and returned to Argentina. I gave most of my remaining wealth to her, promising to return successfully. I vowed to utilize my SSS-grade Gift properly. It’s been 5 years since I made that promise…”
 </p>
 <p>
  With drooping eyes and slurred speech, Masied’s voice was filled with defeat.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded slightly, empathizing with the depth of his sorrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…But I know very well how brilliantly he will change in the future.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Masied eventually finds his way.
 </p>
 <p>
  He becomes a hero in Argentina and the best Mage.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘And since it’s going to happen anyway.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan felt the urge to help him escape from his pit of despair even a day sooner.
 </p>
 <p>
  To make the outstanding Mage, Diego Masied, do his part sooner.
 </p>
 <p>
  For the sake of Earth.
 </p>
 <p>
  And for himself as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Masied.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Look at this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan held up his smartphone.
 </p>
 <p>
  I hope this provides a clearer understanding of the story. Let me know if you need further assistance!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Battle Market page was displayed on the screen.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  “What is this…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is the page after searching for ‘Orbs’.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Orbs.
 </p>
 <p>
  These are accessories resembling beads that are typically used by magicians.
 </p>
 <p>
  They are usually inserted into an extra slot in a magician’s wand to enhance their magical power.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re suggesting… using this like a soccer ball?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Diego Masied, with his eyes glazed over from drinking, focused on the smartphone screen and let out a weak laugh.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The ‘soccer ball shape’ that my Gift recognizes must be precisely the size of a soccer ball. Orbs are too small. I can’t use them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, the orbs available on Earth would be that size.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then why are you showing this to me…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But what if we look at this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan changed the search term.
 </p>
 <p>
  To ‘Otherworldly Relic – Orbs’.
 </p>
 <p>
  Different orbs, each of various sizes, appeared, unlike the ones previously seen on the Battle Market.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s this…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Otherworldly Relics appear in the search results only when you specifically check for them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who had utilized the Otherworldly Relics extensively, knew that these objects, true to their extraterrestrial origin, came in a variety of sizes. Some were as small as a fingernail, while others were unimaginably large.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I didn’t know such things existed. But the ‘soccer ball shape’ condition isn’t just about the size.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. The material also has to be similar. And it should be suitable for use with feet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “H-How did you know all this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Now isn’t the time to drink!’
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hold on… wait!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Slap!
 </p>
 <p>
  Diego Masied quickly put his glass down and slapped himself in an attempt to sober up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright… continue.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Now ready to listen, Masied watched as Seong Jihan added another search term to the Battle Market.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How about adding ‘Arachne’ to the search for Otherworldly Relics?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Arachne.
 </p>
 <p>
  This term refers to an extraterrestrial race resembling giant spiders.
 </p>
 <p>
  With this term added, orbs used by the Arachne appeared on the Battle Market.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Arachne race, spider-like in nature. Their orbs are wrapped in spider silk, resembling… a soccer ball.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Masied couldn’t remove his gaze from the smartphone screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Arachne orb, with white threads forming its outer layer and a red glow in its center, looked very similar to a soccer ball in shape and size.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Moreover, the Arachne, being spider-like, naturally use these orbs with their feet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How did you… find this…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  How could Seong Jihan possibly have discovered such an item? It was a natural question for Masied to ask. However, Seong Jihan already had an answer prepared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I came across it while I was searching for Relics.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now that you mention it… you have always used peculiar weapons.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Remembering, Seong Jihan had indeed used a variety of unique weapons, from regular knives and clubs to even those typically used by Orcs.
 </p>
 <p>
  [TL/N: Orcs – Previously termed as Urks.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Masied then checked the price of the Arachne orbs.
 </p>
 <p>
  Only three were available, starting from grade B, with the lowest price being 500,000 GP.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm. 500,000 GP…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Masied gulped.
 </p>
 <p>
  500,000 GP, equivalent to 500 million Korean won.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he had discovered this ten years ago, the price might not have seemed so daunting. But now, living as a foreign worker, it was an unimaginable amount.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even if Otherworldly Relics are said to be cheap, given its B-grade, the price is quite steep.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Masied, let’s get to the point.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Tap! Tap!
 </p>
 <p>
  Right in front of Masied, Seong Jihan added the Arachne orb worth 500 million won to the cart.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll buy this for you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You will…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Just like that, offering to buy something worth 500 million won.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gulp!
 </p>
 <p>
  Masied swallowed hard again.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you… want in return?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “One year.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan held up his index finger.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sign a contract with me for just one year.”
 </p>

  Chapter 391

 <p>
  Chapter 391
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If the color is pure white, does it relate to the White Administrator?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Through the color of the message window, Seong Jihan deduced which administrator had intervened.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It seems they’re using me as a pawn to draw out the Red Administrator.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Could the suspected Red Administrator actually be the Martial God?
 </p>
 <p>
  While he wasn’t thrilled about being used as bait by the administrators,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should still take what I can.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Feeling offended wasn’t a reason to forgo the rewards.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan chose to focus on practicality.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, the special reward he received was:
 </p>
 <p>
  [A special condition for upgrading the overall viewer rating, the ‘10-year channel operation’ condition, has been removed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The overall viewer rating has been upgraded to the ‘Famous’ level.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The special condition blocking the upgrade to the Star Buff was removed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So this was the special condition?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Running a channel for 10 years.
 </p>
 <p>
  Without this removal, upgrading the Star Buff would have been impossible for the foreseeable future.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Definitely seems like the White Administrator is connected to BattleTube.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Reading the message likely from the White Administrator, known for providing BattleTube-related rewards, Seong Jihan thought thus.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Star Buff is being upgraded.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [When the Star Buff is activated, all stats are amplified by 100%.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [As the amplification effect reaches 100%, a special upgrade option appears.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Please choose one of the two options.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [New Star]
 </p>
 <p>
  – Upgrades the existing Star Buff effect.
 </p>
 <p>
  – The more concurrent viewers you have, the more the buff effect increases. Activating ‘Supernova’ mode multiplies the Star Buff effect tenfold.
 </p>
 <p>
  – However, using Supernova will nullify the New Star effect.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Official Channel]
 </p>
 <p>
  – Stream three times a week for five years.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Becomes one of BattleTube’s ‘official channels,’ earning constellation fame with each video play.
 </p>
 <p>
  – However, this removes the Star Buff effect.
 </p>
 <p>
  New Star and Official Channel.
 </p>
 <p>
  Choosing between the two was evident.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘New Star it is.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Becoming an official channel may have accumulated the rare constellation fame,
 </p>
 <p>
  but losing the Star Buff was a significant drawback.
 </p>
 <p>
  In peaceful times, opting for the latter might foster greater development.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘In these critical times, power is paramount.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan selected the New Star upgrade option.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [New Star effect has been added to the Star Buff.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The buff efficiency increases in proportion to the number of viewers.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Failing to reach the criterion, stat amplification remains at 100%.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The New Star effect immediately applied to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  The high criterion meant the viewer-proportionate buff increase was not activated.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This should suffice…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Having settled the Epic Quest reward,
 </p>
 <p>
  – Jihan! What about the racial bonuses… aren’t you going to choose?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ah, don’t rush him; he’s probably thinking about it.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Oh, but I’m curious. The mission is over, and I want to see the racial bonuses before the stream ends!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Can we ascend to a mid-tier race with four bonuses?
 </p>
 <p>
  – It hasn’t been that long since we became a low-tier race, lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  As hoped by the human viewers, he decided to check the racial bonuses.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s see.’
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, he had earned a total of four racial evolution bonuses.
 </p>
 <p>
  Two from summoning the Thunder God, and another two from defeating him.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do you wish to receive the racial bonuses?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Waiting for Seong Jihan to press the button.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright, let’s check the racial bonuses.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Tap.
 </p>
 <p>
  The message popped up as he claimed the rewards.
 </p>
 <p>
  [A special reward, ‘Racial Evolution Bonus,’ has been granted.]

 <p>
  [Fire Affinity increases by +1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Fire Affinity increases by +1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Fire Affinity increases by +1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Magic Power increases by +3.]
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, the racial bonuses included Fire Affinity, thrice.
 </p>
 <p>
  -…Why only fire affinity?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Didn’t he defeat the Thunder God? Where’s the lightning affinity, lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Fire mages are in luck;
 </p>
 <p>
  – Since most mages start with fire attack spells, this is beneficial for fire mages.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Regular players might not feel much difference…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Maybe less prone to burns? With increased fire affinity, lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though viewers had high expectations for the four racial bonuses, the result left them baffled.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite defeating the Thunder God, the rewards involved unrelated Fire Affinity three times.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Perplexing, but the higher affinity makes managing the Red stat easier.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With the Red stat stopped at 60 to avoid internal disobedience, increasing Fire Affinity made controlling the flames easier, allowing free manipulation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This coincidence isn’t random… Seems like the administrators are directly aiding me to endure the Red Administrator’s power.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Raising Fire Affinity thrice among countless affinities was too convenient to be mere chance.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed administrators’ intentions were behind this.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Their intentions are obvious, but I should use everything to my advantage.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Once the Red’s control stabilizes, he should unseal the eye from the Black’s Sealing Box to raise his stats further.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pondering thus, Seong Jihan logged out.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  [Boss Rush’s racial bonuses boost fire mages!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Are BattleNet administrators mightier than gods? Speculations on the entities revered by extraterrestrials.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Seong Jihan hits the jackpot, gaining 70 times his GP through self-betting! Now Earth’s richest?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Is Seong Jihan mere bait? Eerie discussions from his channel featuring the Eye of Light.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Boss Rush game, which yielded four racial bonuses, became a global sensation even after its conclusion.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Mage damage has skyrocketed.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Yes, fire-based mages claim their damage doubled.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Most mages learn basic fire magic, making this a celebration for them.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Warriors have raised fire resistance, so enduring flames has become easier.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Really? Regular folks don’t notice much difference, lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Yeah, we had enjoyed health improvements before, but this is a bit disappointing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike previous rewards benefiting humanity broadly, this bonus mainly strengthened mages.
 </p>
 <p>
  Increased Fire Affinity improved fire resistance for all players but was more beneficial for mages.
 </p>
 <p>
  And.
 </p>
 <p>
  – The Arena Master and an administrator… what are they plotting with Seong Jihan?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Seong Jihan mentioned being bait. This seems concerning.
 </p>
 <p>
  – With the Eye of Light, off-the-record information is filtering through hilariously.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Seong Jihan’s transcendence might make it a personal issue.
 </p>
 <p>
  – No, the Arena Master specifically mentioned offering humanity and Jihan an opportunity.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  – What happens if this opportunity is missed?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Extinction?
 </p>
 <p>
  Listeners grasping unfiltered information from the Eye of Light speculated variously.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jihan! The racial bonus seems to affect me too!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As usual, Sophia, visiting the penthouse, exclaimed to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]

 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did the Sacred Flame get stronger?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes!”
 </p>
 <p>
  When she opened her palm,
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoooosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The formerly weak, easily extinguished white Sacred Flame now burned intensely.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This seems about 70% of the previous level. Maybe it harmonizes well with Fire Affinity?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Indeed…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Nodding, Seong Jihan scrutinized the Sacred Flame.
 </p>
 <p>
  The white Sacred Flame held sacred power, the Red’s energy, among various other forces.
 </p>
 <p>
  With his Red stat nearly doubled to 60, he pondered understanding the Sacred Flame,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Still unclear.’
 </p>
 <p>
  But understanding the other forces comprising the Sacred Flame remained elusive.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Pythia’s actions suggest hidden significance…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps the clue lies elsewhere than the Red stat?
 </p>
 <p>
  After examining the Sacred Flame further,
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  “Oh, maintaining it is tough now…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright, let’s stop here for today.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Sacred Flame dimmed, they concluded the inspection.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, watching Seong Jihan’s Boss Rush replay on the living room TV, spoke after she scrutinized the Sacred Flame.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle, why only fire bonuses this time? Is it due to the Red Administrator… his hand?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Likely.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The cosmic-headed guy’s remarks were ominous too. Calling you bait, mentioning ‘final opportunity’… a lot seems significant.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking at Seong Jihan worriedly, Yoon Seah asked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…How did you catch all that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “All of it was in your broadcast now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, even that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, people are speculating all sorts of things.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Accepting the Eye of Light to maintain the Star Buff caused unintended transparency to humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Though, on second thought, why not let it be public?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Unfiltered association with the missing Red Administrator drew exponential extraterrestrial interest, even the Great Constellations.
 </p>
 <p>
  Higher BattleTube concentration would enhance the Star Buff.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Riding a tiger’s back… I need to prioritize strength above all.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering the need for attention to fuel the Star Buff, Seong Jihan realized openness might be strategic.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If needed, detailing the current situation in a briefing isn’t a bad idea later…’
 </p>
 <p>
  If the channel’s growth stagnates, maybe then.
 </p>
 <p>
  Concluding this, Seong Jihan opted for a full disclosure strategy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Maximizing the New Star trait’s potential.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Details about the Red Administrator aren’t fully clear yet. I’ll speak about it all at once later.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. I might even broadcast it openly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “On BattleTube? Whew… Isn’t a hero supposed to hide their strength?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The old-fashioned hero, maybe. Now it’s about self-PR.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s nonchalant remark elicited a worried look from Yoon Seah, who eventually nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Okay. I’ll wait until you explain.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Great.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now, let’s worry about the match with China.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The China match?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, it’s in three days.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan casually responded.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the midst of being monitored by administrators, matters concerning national contests seemed trivial.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes… This racial bonus made Je Galheon so powerful, the next match is worrisome.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Je Galheon of China? Isn’t he not a fire mage? He uses the Eight Trigrams Overlap.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even the Eight Trigrams Overlap has fire-related trigrams. He’s become very strong.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… really? Good luck.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh, Uncle, haven’t you reconsidered retiring?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “True, it’s just… not joining the regional league makes sense.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the solitary peak among human players, Seong Jihan’s gap only widened over time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Joining national contests amid such disparity felt like an adult intruding on children’s games.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Though achieving world rank 1 might garner constellation fame…’
 </p>
 <p>
  He hadn’t fully retired from the national team, barely keeping up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Recent escalations left no room to focus on nation matches.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But… uh, Uncle. Could you visit the BattleNet center, if possible?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Last time, China didn’t ban you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Perhaps given my infrequent participation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan didn’t mind much.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Other nations ban you just in case, yet China doesn’t. The coach suspects an insider spy liaising with China within the BattleNet center…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, you don’t need to compete… Just show up at the center. If there’s an insider, they’ll enforce the ban; if not, they won’t.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Checking for spies?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The center is right next door, so.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Show up briefly and head to the training grounds after.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay, I’ll stop by.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan answered lightly as if visiting a friend’s home.
 </p>
 <p>
  And three days later.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Seong Jihan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A staff member covertly approached him at the BattleNet center.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I… bring a message from someone.”

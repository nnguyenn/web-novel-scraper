  Chapter 392
 </p>
 <p>
  As October arrived,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Northeast Asia Regional League divided distinctly into two powerhouses.
 </p>
 <p>
  Korea and China.
 </p>
 <p>
  Undefeated Korea and China, victorious in all but one match against Korea,
 </p>
 <p>
  stood on the brink of deciding the league champion.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Good day, viewers.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Today, we finally have the match that will determine the top spot against China.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Korea, riding a winning streak, faces China, which has only lost once to Korea. If China wins here, we might have to face them again for the league’s top spot.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Exactly! Neither team has lost to any other countries!
 </p>
 <p>
  Commentators, who hyped the upcoming match with fervor, drew viewers’ attention,
 </p>
 <p>
  who watched with nervous anticipation.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Today’s game is so crucial.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Despite not having Seong Jihan, we held the top spot well haha
 </p>
 <p>
  -The Sword King duo and Sophia really played key roles.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Key roles? Those players carried the team, lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -True, the other players still lag far behind China.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Honestly, I still don’t know how we won without Seong Jihan last time.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yeah, we got lucky with the map lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -Je Galheon has gotten super strong this time; it won’t be easy…
 </p>
 <p>
  While Korea had beaten China without Seong Jihan,
 </p>
 <p>
  even Korean viewers acknowledged luck played a huge role in that victory.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hoping for another stroke of luck this time seemed too much.
 </p>
 <p>
  Naturally, people started thinking about who was missing from the national team lineup,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Can’t Seong Jihan just step in once…?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Asking an adult to handle kids’ fights, huh?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Come on, just this once, what’s the point of having strong connections?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Don’t drag Seong into trivial matches while he’s handling cosmic tasks for humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Right, do you really want him to come down for a mere national match?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Look at how the Chinese are wary of Seong Jihan coming ㅡㅡ;
 </p>
 <p>
  -That’s a valid point haha
 </p>
 <p>
  Koreans hoped for Seong Jihan to just step in once to secure the top spot, but didn’t hold high expectations.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since he was responsible for humanity’s victory in the Space League and walked a path no one had dared before as a constellation candidate,
 </p>
 <p>
  it seemed unlikely he would come out for the national team he had already led to victory.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Focus is on whether China will ban Seong Jihan again today.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Last match, China didn’t ban him even from the first match, unlike other countries who banned him in the first and second matches.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Exactly. It raised questions about BattleNet Center’s security.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Do you think Seong Jihan will compete today?
 </p>
 <p>
  =It would be great, but given the major event he recently participated in, it’s unclear if he’ll cover this match…
 </p>
 <p>
  Even the commentators were skeptical of Seong Jihan’s participation.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, at the BattleNet Center,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Se…Seong Jihan!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan unexpectedly visited, overturning all predictions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, Coach, I just dropped by for a visit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan greeted Coach Noh Youngjun,
 </p>
 <p>
  “If they don’t ban me in the first match, I’ll secure one easy win before leaving.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Re…really? That would be fantastic!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan declared his intention to participate in the first match.
 </p>
 <p>
  Coach Noh’s face lit up instantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘We were worried about Je Galheon’s increased strength, but if Jihan joins, we’ll win easily…!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the racial bonuses Seong Jihan earned benefiting the Chinese team,
 </p>
 <p>
  Korea, originally weak in the mage class, faced significant power differences.
 </p>
 <p>
  But Seong Jihan’s participation would change everything.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jihan, since you’re here… Could you stay in the coaching room until just before the first match?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stay in the coaching room?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Last match against China, they seemed to have a lot of our strategies figured out. It’s almost as if they knew in real-time you weren’t playing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is there someone leaking information to China?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Possibly. Some are suspected, but nothing concrete.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Coach Noh spoke, furrowing his brows.
 </p>
 <p>
  “For now, catching the spy isn’t the priority. Winning this match is. Please come to the players’ waiting room when I contact you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright, I’ll look around the coaching room.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, relax here. The match will start soon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Wooosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Coach Noh exited,
 </p>
 <p>
  while Seong Jihan casually looked around the coaching room before sitting on a sofa, taking out his smartphone.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Seems no one expects my participation.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing real-time viewer responses, Seong Jihan chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  Knock, knock.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Is anyone here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Hearing a staff member’s voice outside, Seong Jihan didn’t respond.
 </p>
 <p>
  He could pretend he wasn’t there if the person came in.
 </p>
 <p>
  After all, concealing his presence from ordinary people was too easy for someone like Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Knock, knock, knock.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Seong Jihan, are you in?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The staff specifically mentioning his name changed things.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘How did they know I was here? Did the coach inform them?’
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t yet time for the match.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan tilted his head in curiosity but responded,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, I’m here. Come in.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Click.
 </p>
 <p>
  A seemingly ordinary, exhausted staff member entered and approached Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did the coach call you out?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, I have a message from him.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “From who?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The person is…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The staff checked around, then approached Seong Jihan,
 </p>
 <p>
  lowering his voice,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Gilgamesh has a message.”
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Gilgamesh… that guy’s quite active, huh.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Hearing the staff mention Gilgamesh, Seong Jihan frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite repeatedly warning the public about Gilgamesh’s dangers,
 </p>
 <p>
  he seemed to be growing his influence from behind the scenes.
 </p>
 <p>
  For a Korean staff member to carry his message implied strong inroads.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So… what does he say?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to hear him out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then.
 </p>
 <p>
  “He says he will reveal Tuseong’s secret…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Tuseong’s secret?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. He asks you to participate in this match against China.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was planning to, anyway.”
 </p>
 <p>
  But why specifically the China match?
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Has he already started supporting the Chinese players?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan had previously supported the Diamond TOP 100 during racial evolution.
 </p>
 <p>
  Many of China’s national players were among them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps Gilgamesh had approached those not backed by Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  What a persistent guy.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now, I’ll take my leave. I’ll resign as well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The staff, caught as Gilgamesh’s lackey, announced his resignation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded,
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Alright. How did you get his support? You don’t seem to be a player.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Support? I wouldn’t dare. I merely conveyed the king’s message.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where did you hear it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…A family member grew ears after racial evolution.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ears grew?
 </p>
 <p>
  “A family member joined the Half-Elf Community?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, there… they heard the king’s message.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The same Half-Elf Community Yoon Seah had joined.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh, under the name ‘Owner of Tuseong,’ had been infiltrating this community, growing his power by fully supporting those with Half-Elf traits.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I requested BattleNet Association to handle this community, but it seems they’ve grown stronger.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As expected, BattleNet Association proves inefficient.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Can’t focus on this myself.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With so much to handle, he couldn’t shut down the foreign-established Half-Elf Community.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had warned them sufficiently; if they couldn’t act, it wasn’t his job to handle it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shortly after the staff left,
 </p>
 <p>
  Brrrr…
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s phone vibrated.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Jihan, it’s starting now.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A message from Coach Noh Youngjun.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  In the BattleNet Center’s waiting room,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Se…Seong Jihan!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you playing today?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There was no word from the coach…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Players, preparing for the game, were startled by Seong Jihan’s arrival.
 </p>
 <p>
  And.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow… seeing Seong Jihan in person…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait, you haven’t seen him before?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No! I joined after the World’s Champions League!”
 </p>
 <p>
  New team members idolized Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among national players, he had become a symbol of admiration and reverence.
 </p>
 <p>
  Many new members had dreamt of joining the national team just to meet him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Scanning the room, Seong Jihan approached Coach Noh.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shall I prepare?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, it’s time to draw the ban and select cards.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan prepared,
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  “Wow… are we really playing with Seong Jihan?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was worried about China, but this makes it an easy win.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “True. Confirming top spot.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Players’ nervous chatter eased quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Now, finally.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ban, select for the first match begins!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Oh… The Chinese coach bans the representative’s first pick…
 </p>
 <p>
  =That means banning Seong Jihan. Unlike last time, their judgment is completely different!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Given the importance, they might think Seong Jihan will play?
 </p>
 <p>
  China’s sudden decision to ban Seong Jihan surprised the team.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What… how did they know to ban Seong Jihan…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Maybe anticipating Je Galheon’s increased strength, blocking any odds?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Still odd…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Debating China’s different judgment, Seong Jihan narrowed his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh specifically mentioned this match.
 </p>
 <p>
  How did China’s coach know and just ban him?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The staff who delivered Gilgamesh’s message isn’t a spy…’
 </p>
 <p>
  No encounters until the coaching room.
 </p>
 <p>
  That leaves someone within this waiting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Regardless of their surprise…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Sinking into concentration,Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  amplifying his senses with Martial Soul,
 </p>
 <p>
  he found one person with an excessively rapid heartbeat.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s see…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan stood beside a man clutching his phone.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What… what is it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The man seemed overly startled, trying to touch his phone more.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Excuse me a moment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The phone slipped right out of his hand, floating before Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Urgent. Seong Jihan playing.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Reading the short text, Seong Jihan smiled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I didn’t expect a national player to sell information to a competitor.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This, this is…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jinsoo! You…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you send info before too?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Revealing the text to all, reactions of shock fixed on the man.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even suspecting staff, why would a national player sell information?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Expel this person.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait, that’s…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Staff can’t handle him alone. Let me deal with it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Tap, tap.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan applied the Heaven’s Chaotic Flow on the man,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  He froze, collapsing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike Seong Jihan who could still move under such a seal, it had an overwhelming effect on him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Still breathing.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Confirming his breath, Seong Jihan gestured to staff to remove him.
 </p>
 <p>
  The traitor was carried out on a stretcher.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow… China went far preparing. Didn’t expect a national player sellout.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, watching, approached and shook her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But uncle… how did you know it was him?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “His heartbeat was fast, so I checked him out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You can sense that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you try, you can tell.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course, constellation candidate…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah clicked her tongue,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thought with uncle we’d win easy, but they banned you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why can’t you benefit from me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What? You’re banned.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Different approach. Wanna become undead again?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Though they tried to block Seong Jihan’s play,
 </p>
 <p>
  he had other cards to use.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Cheat code?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, they’ll pay for planting a spy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “People were hyped for this match… but it’ll be anti-climactic.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, do you dislike it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nope. Winning easily in games is best.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She smiled broadly,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll smash them all for you, uncle.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In the ensuing game,
 </p>
 <p>
  =Oh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Yoon Seah charges!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Is she undead? Such power!
 </p>
 <p>
  =China’s defense crumbles…!
 </p>
 <p>
  She did as she promised.

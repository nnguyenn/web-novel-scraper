  Chapter 393
 </p>
 <p>
  First Match Against China.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Oh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Yoon Seah appears different from usual.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Is this not her undead form…?
 </p>
 <p>
  =If she’s in undead form, then surely…
 </p>
 <p>
  =Was Seong Jihan possibly in the waiting room!?
 </p>
 <p>
  =Yoon Seah! She’s charging alone!
 </p>
 <p>
  At the start of the game, Yoon Seah, having transformed into her undead form, rushed alone into China’s camp.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Undead form… why now…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Was Seong Jihan really in the waiting room??”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of all times, why now…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Support! Counter her with divine power!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Chinese team, aware of her undead form’s power, tried to counter her.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom! Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  With her void-enhanced strength, Yoon Seah decimated the enemy camp.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow, her undead form means…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Seong Jihan must be around? Damn
 </p>
 <p>
  -I wondered why China suddenly banned Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But how did China know?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Information leak?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Seong Jihan does not need to appear to secure an easy win lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite being banned, Seong Jihan’s influence on the game was immense.
 </p>
 <p>
  Without even showing up, he massively impacted the first match.
 </p>
 <p>
  =First match ends!
 </p>
 <p>
  =The undead power seen against the USA appears again!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Even with Je Galheon’s increased strength, it’s insufficient against this power.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Today’s match, crucial for determining the top in Northeast Asia… since Seong Jihan intervened, it seems like Korea will win?
 </p>
 <p>
  =Indeed, with Je Galheon’s newfound strength we were concerned, but it looks like there’s no need to worry!
 </p>
 <p>
  With the first match ending in victory, the commentators couldn’t hide their excitement.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s participation in the most important match of the regional league against China made the outcome seem certain.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh… Seong Jihan… why now…?
 </p>
 <p>
  -He didn’t appear in the regional league but now he shows up…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Banning him is pointless.
 </p>
 <p>
  -I turned off the TV. It’s a guaranteed 3-0.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Might as well unban Seong Jihan and watch him play.
 </p>
 <p>
  In China, after losing the first match, viewers began to drop off in disappointment.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unable to overcome undead Yoon Seah, hope was lost.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  Emerging from the BattleNet Connector, Yoon Seah approached Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle, the undead form… it got stronger?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really? Must be due to the void’s growth.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. I can be more active even in the Space League.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh, whoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unable to forget the feeling of scorching the Chinese camp in the first match, Yoon Seah imitated shooting arrows.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you keep getting banned, I might snatch the MVP of this series.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Jihan, does the undead form not work on me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Without the void, it’s only possible in-game for you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I see… too bad.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s brother-in-law, Yoon Sejin, resignedly smacked his lips, overshadowed by Yoon Seah’s impact.
 </p>
 <p>
  “For the second match, you’ll likely get banned again, like before?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If Yoon Seah dominated the game, Gilgamesh’s message urging participation in the match against China wouldn’t be heeded.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They need to solve that themselves.’
 </p>
 <p>
  How would he participate if he was repeatedly banned?
 </p>
 <p>
  If Gilgamesh desired to convey something important, he could appear himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan renewed the blessing of undead on Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the second match approached,
 </p>
 <p>
  =Oh… they didn’t ban Seong Jihan! Instead, they banned two from the top 10!
 </p>
 <p>
  =What’s the Chinese coach thinking? This unbans Seong Jihan…
 </p>
 <p>
  =Even if they banned Seong Jihan, if Yoon Seah turns undead again, they’d lose. Expecting any odds on the top 10?
 </p>
 <p>
  =The chance of banning just two from the top 10 seems too slim…
 </p>
 <p>
  =But China’s situation must be dire to attempt such luck!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Chinese coach changed strategy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Banning two from the top 10…is he hoping for luck?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching the Chinese coach resort to relying on luck led the players to chuckle.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  =Oh, China’s ban surprisingly hit!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Yoon Sejin and Yoon Seah were both banned!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Without Seong Jihan, the second match would be tough.
 </p>
 <p>
  =But…
 </p>
 <p>
  =He’s still here, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  The ban card, initially seemingly effective, was nullified by having the number one rank, Seong Jihan, still active.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  “I’ll be back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay. Finish quickly~ I’ll get ready for the third match.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering Seong Jihan’s overwhelming power, national matches should end in under a minute.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah prepared for the next match with this mindset.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But, it might take longer.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh? Even with you playing, uncle?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Steamrolling the Chinese players could end the game swiftly under a minute.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, learning Tuseong’s secret as per Gilgamesh’s message would take time.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He won’t reveal it straightforwardly. He most likely set something in-game.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Anticipating Gilgamesh’s sly moves, Seong Jihan patted Yoon Seah lightly on the head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Take a break.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan entered the BattleNet Connector.
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching him leave, Yoon Seah mused.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Even a drawn-out match would mean less than 2 minutes, right?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Such was the power disparity.
 </p>
 <p>
  But,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh… the game really isn’t ending…”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan predicted, the game didn’t end swiftly.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Second Match Map, ‘Great Forest.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The dense, expansive forest of towering trees,
 </p>
 <p>
  one of BattleNet’s maps known for long playtimes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hidden nooks throughout the forest often resulted in prolonged guerilla warfare between surviving teams.
 </p>
 <p>
  But,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  -How many minutes?
 </p>
 <p>
  -5 minutes.
 </p>
 <p>
  -1 minute.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Nope, he’ll finish with one sword swing, 30 seconds?
 </p>
 <p>
  -In the Great Forest map, it won’t end that fast. Guerilla warfare will take a while to find everyone.
 </p>
 <p>
  -He might rush to finish quickly out of annoyance.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is there no bet for this? lol
 </p>
 <p>
  Given Seong Jihan’s involvement, long playtimes even with the Great Forest map seemed unlikely.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the outcome decided, viewers speculated on how quickly he would secure victory.
 </p>
 <p>
  The game began.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘First, head to the Chinese camp.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Immediately after the start, Seong Jihan sped through the forest.
 </p>
 <p>
  Typically, locating the opposing team took time in this map.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There they are.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Expanding his senses, he quickly located them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Step!
 </p>
 <p>
  He easily arrived before the Chinese players.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What, already found us…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Se…the Constellation…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh… on to the next match.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why didn’t they ban him…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Startled, they slowly retreated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some of them had accepted Seong Jihan as their sponsoring constellation.
 </p>
 <p>
  -One minute match prediction, confirmed.
 </p>
 <p>
  -How does it feel to be killed by your own constellation, lol…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Better end it quickly, that’s the sportsmanship ㅇㅇ
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yup, just finish them.
 </p>
 <p>
  As everyone foresaw the game ending with one sword swing,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Se…Seong Jihan…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You… finally arrived…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Five Chinese players, with slightly pointed ears, trembled as they stepped forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, what are you doing?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why leave the camp!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The unexpected move puzzled even their teammates.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Behold, the king shall judge you…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “To the King Of Humans, I offer this body…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Splat!
 </p>
 <p>
  Drawing daggers from their inventories, five players stabbed their own hearts.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Krgh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Begin the summoning ritual…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The leading Chinese player’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  Blood from their wounds pooled, forming a magic circle.
 </p>
 <p>
  As their collective blood flowed, the circle slowly started forming.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh shit…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Talking about the King Of Humans… is this Gilgamesh again?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Seeing their pointed ears, seems like it.
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  -But why is Seong Jihan just watching?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Normally, you wait when they transform or summon, it’s common sense lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Lol demongod from hel also has pointed ears.
 </p>
 <p>
  The summoning through the blood magic circle took considerable time.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…When does it finish?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait… the blood…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Letting them continue was too lenient.
 </p>
 <p>
  Frowning, Seong Jihan spoke to the Chinese player behind them.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Guys? Heal your comrades. They lack blood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Y-yes. Great Heal!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Obliged by Seong Jihan’s words, the Chinese player healed them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Under his consent, the summoning circle finally completed through their joint effort.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s… finished…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  From the circle, a golden tower began to rise.
 </p>
 <p>
  A miniature version of the Babel Tower seen before.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh, whoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon rotating once,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Seong Jihan. Become mine.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang!
 </p>
 <p>
  Dozens of blood-red chains shot out, targeting Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit huh… But why so weak?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Shoddy sacrifices, perhaps.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though easily blockable,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan hesitated momentarily.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Better hear what he has to say.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He offered an arm,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Chains wrapped around his right arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though seeking other targets,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stay on this arm.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan manipulated space, blocking the chains’ other movements, causing them to settle on his arm alone.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Once bound, they glowed golden.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It tickles.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tickles… This causes you no harm.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you think such sacrifices would work?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I hoped. But I had low expectations.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the chains’ glow intensified,
 </p>
 <p>
  a vision imprinted on Seong Jihan’s mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This is what I recently saw.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh transmitted his memory visually.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan observed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is Tuseong.’
 </p>
 <p>
  On the barren star Tuseong, constellations’ relics floated in the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  In Gilgamesh’s memory, a shadowy Martial God emitted a dark red aura.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the aura reached the constellations’ relics,
 </p>
 <p>
  Woosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Already formidable, the Martial God’s power visibly amplified.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Did the constellations’ relics have such power?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan had seen the star Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak had once summoned him there, urging him to abandon Martial Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  Offering one of those relics as a replacement.
 </p>
 <p>
  He ignored it back then,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I didn’t realize their power.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Though viewed through Gilgamesh’s eyes,
 </p>
 <p>
  the linked Martial God exhibited at least tenfold power increase.
 </p>
 <p>
  The already vast gap further widened with the link.
 </p>
 <p>
  After showing the Martial God’s amplified power, the vision ended.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Did you see?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh’s voice emerged from the chains.
 </p>
 <p>
  [No constellation relic can amplify power so much. Tenfold augmentation for the Martial God… it’s impossible.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I was curious, so I investigated the relics extensively with all my resources.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  A new scene appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  A half-destroyed relic lay on Tuseong’s ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh’s find?
 </p>
 <p>
  [And I discovered something.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [This relic holds massive data. Records of humanity entering BattleNet and its fall.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Records of entry and doom?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  Could it be his past life’s events?
 </p>
 <p>
  [From this data, I saw the Martial God defeat me… you, the last of humanity, still survived.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes, Seong Jihan. Join me.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Usually confident, Gilgamesh’s voice sounded weak in this plea.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Under the relics in the sky, none can defeat the Martial God… we must cooperate against him.]
 </p>

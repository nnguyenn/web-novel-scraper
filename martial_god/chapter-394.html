  Chapter 394
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Gilgamesh really meant it when he said he would reveal Tuseong’s secret. I’ve obtained useful information.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Relic of the Constellations.
 </p>
 <p>
  The fact that it could amplify the Martial God’s power was something even Seong Jihan hadn’t anticipated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, it contained records of humanity’s entrance into BattleNet and its subsequent downfall.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…I recall the numerous times I perished in the embrace of the Taiji’s Sword.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Various images surfaced simultaneously.
 </p>
 <p>
  The fragments of Seong Jihan mixed within the Abyss Owner, shredded by the Taiji Sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the Golden Wheel, the third disciple possessing the ability to rewind time…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘By sealing the power within the Relic of the Constellations and rewinding time upon humanity’s collapse… If such a process is repeated hundreds, thousands of times, the number of relics in Tuseong’s sky will multiply.’
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan couldn’t fully understand the Martial God’s method, he deduced a rough outline of the process.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan pondered deeply without responding,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Of course, it’s difficult to trust me fully when I propose cooperation.]Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh, assuming Seong Jihan was rejecting him, spoke up again.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s certainly true.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [However, our conflict is trivial. The power of the Martial God, our mutual enemy, has become too overwhelming for one individual. Indeed. To build trust, I shall reveal the location where the World Tree is sealed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Making a significant concession, Gilgamesh offered first.
 </p>
 <p>
  [It is near your country’s current location.]
 </p>
 <p>
  But Seong Jihan couldn’t help but chuckle upon hearing this.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I already know that place.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […Is that so? Hmm. The energy of life was acquired from there… Could it be that you were able to complete the Domination Code from there?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon Seong Jihan’s revelation, Gilgamesh discovered why the Domination Code was completed during the racial evolution.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Then… I shall teach you the term to dominate the World Tree within the seal.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh. Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  The chains binding Seong Jihan’s arm quivered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before his eyes, letters emerged.
 </p>
 <p>
  The letters, similar to those forming the Domination Code, read:
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s time to sever the serpent’s neck.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Write this on the World Tree, and the seal will be easily broken.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “The serpent….”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That would be the Martial God.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh’s chains gradually unraveled, and his voice grew faint.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Though the legends say the serpent took the elixir of immortality, the truth is reversed. I received immortality from the serpent…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Break the seal of the World Tree and gain strength there. Then, we shall discuss cooperation.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The chains of Gilgamesh vanished after delivering the message.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Isn’t this just his covert desire to break the World Tree’s seal?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Though he claimed it was for the sake of cooperation and offered information first, Seong Jihan suspected Gilgamesh’s true intention was to break the World Tree’s seal.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite his suspicions, Seong Jihan committed the seal-breaking phrase to memory.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Is it… over?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the chains, which had been created through the sacrifice of five individuals, disappeared, the Chinese players stared blankly at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah, what just happened?
 </p>
 <p>
  =That magic circle earlier, was it the Tower of Babel… Wasn’t that Gilgamesh’s artifact?
 </p>
 <p>
  =I’m concerned that there are still factions supporting him, but who knew there would be five among the Chinese national players…
 </p>
 <p>
  =For something summoned with such effort, it dissipated surprisingly quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Rather than binding Seong Jihan, it seemed like they were having a conversation.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Yes, though we couldn’t hear, their lips were moving…
 </p>
 <p>
  Commentators questioned the second match’s unusual sequence.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why aren’t they attacking? Seong Jihan was captured before.
 </p>
 <p>
  -His arm was merely bound, and he seemed to chat comfortably, lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Even if they attacked, they wouldn’t even scratch him, lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  -True, damage would need to register first.
 </p>
 <p>
  -What were they talking about?
 </p>
 <p>
  -I wish Seong Jihan was live-streaming; broadcast doesn’t give a clue.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Gilgamesh is dumber than proks lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers, who noticed the movements of Seong Jihan’s lips, were curious about their conversation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan watched as the Tower of Babel and the magic circle faded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you for waiting.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He turned to the remaining Chinese players.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shall we wrap up Match 2?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  As a dark sword formed in Seong Jihan’s hand,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not harmed by the chains…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “S-stop him…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Chinese players tried to react, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  Whish!
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  The sword slashed across them first.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud. Thud…
 </p>
 <p>
  The Chinese players’ bodies split in half and fell simultaneously.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Thunk! Thunk!
 </p>
 <p>
  The towering trees in the Great Forest began to collapse each in turn.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Match 2 ends.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Immediately, the game-ending message appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  After the second match,
 </p>
 <p>
  =Match 2 concludes!
 </p>
 <p>
  =No Chinese player could withstand even one strike from Seong Jihan…
 </p>
 <p>
  =While initially restrained by chains, the result was as expected!
 </p>
 <p>
  =With Korea winning both matches 1 and 2, they have a favorable position!
 </p>
 <p>
  The commentators spoke confidently about the victory.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow… one strike!
 </p>
 <p>
  -He couldn’t finish in one minute, but without the chains, it could have been under 30 seconds.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Did the Chinese players give up too soon?
 </p>
 <p>
  -No, they tried to resist but couldn’t.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Seong Jihan’s involvement in national matches is like a cheat code, lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers, commentators, and even the Chinese players on the national team knew the game was one-sided.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This should do it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to end his involvement in the national matches.
 </p>
 <p>
  With victories in the first and second matches, it was now up to the Korean national team to handle the rest.
 </p>
 <p>
  And,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to investigate the World Tree’s seal soon.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Having conquered the Heaven’s Chaotic Flow and learned the words of domination for the World Tree, the preparations were complete.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should quickly delve back into exploring the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams.’
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle, are you leaving?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. You can win one of the remaining three games, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan reached out to the confident Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The void’s power, the Blessing of Undead, which had turned her undead, was reclaimed by Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You can manage without this, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “N-naturally. We’ll win one game… right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking slightly less confident, Yoon Seah was reassured when Yoon Sejin patted her shoulders from behind.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah, stay confident. We’ve beaten them before. We can definitely win.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right! Uncle, don’t worry. We’ll finish this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright. I trust you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Waving his hand, Seong Jihan approached Coach Noh Youngjun to bid farewell.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Coach, I’ll be leaving now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, Jihan. Would it be possible for you to stay…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, Coach. I feel uncomfortable intervening beyond this point.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, yes, it’s enough that you helped us win two matches against China…”
 </p>
 <p>
  As much as Coach Noh wanted Seong Jihan to stay for the final match, he accepted he couldn’t force him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Can’t compel him if he doesn’t want to stay…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Coach Noh had to accept Seong Jihan’s decision.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then.”
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  After Seong Jihan left the BattleNet center, Coach Noh looked around at his team with a look of resolve.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Indeed, we’ve depended on Jihan too much. Let’s win the next match on our own.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, Coach!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “China still thinks Jihan is here. Let’s finish this in the third match.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, sir!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite resolving to give their all in the third match,
 </p>
 <p>
  =China banned Seong Jihan this time. However, Yoon Seah is still here. Will we see a repeat of the first match?
 </p>
 <p>
  =Oh… but Yoon Seah isn’t in undead form this time!
 </p>
 <p>
  =What does this mean…?
 </p>
 <p>
  =It seems Seong Jihan is absent again!
 </p>
 <p>
  With Yoon Seah’s undead form gone, it became obvious Seong Jihan had left.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No Seong Jihan…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is our chance!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We can turn the game around now…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Chinese team, suddenly show renewed vigor after Seong Jihan’s departure,
 </p>
 <p>
  The match atmosphere shifted abruptly in favor of China.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the fierce competition continued from the third match, it was only in the fifth match that Korea barely seized another victory, making the final score 3-2.
 </p>
 <p>
  =It was challenging despite leading comfortably after the first two matches, but at last, Korea has secured the top spot in the regional league and advances to the Champions League!
 </p>
 <p>
  While Korea was barely securing the top spot in their group,
 </p>

 <p>
  ‘Time to delve in.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan had arrived at the ocean floor, preparing to enter the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan stepped into the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams., he felt the world turn upside down.
 </p>
 <p>
  And as soon as the world completely flipped,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm… Is this the Heaven’s Chaotic Flow?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The acupoint-sealing technique that Dongbang Sak once used to confine space.
 </p>
 <p>
  Heaven’s Chaotic Flow was activated automatically.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So, that’s why he told me to master it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the pressure from the Heaven’s Chaotic Flow was stronger compared to when he used it on himself, Seong Jihan easily nullified it using Martial Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whizz!
 </p>
 <p>
  A sword, flying towards Seong Jihan from above, halted right in front of his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I hadn’t nullified the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams, this sword would’ve pierced me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The sword hovered briefly before him before flying back up.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan surveyed his surroundings.
 </p>
 <p>
  The landscape, unlike the lush green forest with the flowing river last time, was now cracked, dried, and barren wasteland.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There are ten swords hovering in the sky…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The presence wielded by those swords was strong, but nothing Seong Jihan couldn’t easily handle with his current power.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Still, let’s avoid confrontation and look around first.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Carefully advancing while observing his surroundings, Seong Jihan walked for about ten minutes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon, his eyes caught sight of a massive tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Judging by the energy it exudes, it seems to be a World Tree… There’s no guardian this time.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The immense life force emanating from the giant tree was akin to the previous World Tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, this time there was a difference.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This World Tree is entirely red.’
 </p>
 <p>
  From roots to trunk, branches to leaves, this World Tree was engulfed in an ominous crimson hue.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The color suggests the presence of the Red’s power?’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan approached the red World Tree to examine it more closely,
 </p>
 <p>
  Rumble.
 </p>
 <p>
  Roots emerged from the ground and formed letters in the air by breaking and rearranging themselves.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do you wish to break the seal?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  A large wooden plank emerged from the ground as the floating letters transformed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Please input the seal-breaking term here.]
 </p>
 <p>
  So, this is to make use of what Gilgamesh taught right away?
 </p>
 <p>
  If I break the seal now, I am basically playing into his hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll use it later.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan replied, intending to explore this world first.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Understood.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The root-written letters acknowledged his response.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The red World Tree… it doesn’t seem hostile towards me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan found it curious, approaching the World Tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  Up close, the tree’s size was more imposing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Big enough to accommodate hundreds of people.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Time to inspect more closely…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as Seong Jihan was about to reach out to the red World Tree,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Warning. Warning. A Watcher is approaching.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A red alert message appeared before his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rumble!
 </p>
 <p>
  A hole opened in the trunk, and a red arrow appeared in the air pointing towards it.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Entering here is recommended.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Why so helpful? Or is it a trap?’
 </p>
 <p>
  After a brief hesitation,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Maybe it’s better to be inside to absorb this.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Deciding to counter any potential trap by consuming the World Tree himself, Seong Jihan entered the trunk.
 </p>
 <p>
  Contrary to his expectations, the inside was a comforting chamber.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though standing vertically inside the tree trunk, it felt as soft as lying on a bed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon after,
 </p>
 <p>
  Step. Step.
 </p>
 <p>
  Footsteps approached the red World Tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There was definitely an intruder…”
 </p>
 <p>
  A somber voice came from beyond the trunk.
 </p>
 <p>
  To Seong Jihan, the voice was familiar.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Would you like to observe the Watcher?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Like a status screen message, letters floated mid-air.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan nodded,
 </p>
 <p>
  Tap. Tap.
 </p>
 <p>
  Holes appeared in the trunk, revealing the outside.
 </p>
 <p>
  The revealed watcher was,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Knew it… it was him.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak, with a haggard face.

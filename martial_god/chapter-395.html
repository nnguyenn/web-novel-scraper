 <p>
  Chapter 395
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ve never seen Dongbang Sak look so old.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In the past, during the Kang Sang era, or even in the current world, Dongbang Sak appeared aged but with clear skin and few wrinkles.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the one visible through the World Tree now had dark spots on his face and dull skin, giving him an overall unhealthy appearance.
 </p>
 <p>
  His once-thick beard was sparse, and his entire face looked worn and weary.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘For someone of his martial prowess to appear like this…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Had much more time passed since the Kang Sang era?
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan observed Dongbang Sak’s actions, he wondered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…This time for sure.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With an expression of deep resolve, Dongbang Sak glared at the red World Tree and drew his sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Behind him, the shape of the Taiji began to materialize.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a flow of energy similar to when he used the Taiji Sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, his movements were more precise, forming the Taiji more accurately than Seong Jihan could.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘His execution is more refined than mine. Observing closely, this is certainly a good learning opportunity…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Should he stop him?
 </p>
 <p>
  If the Taiji Sword appeared within the Taiji, everything would be devastated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Given this wasn’t a game where people could respawn, Seong Jihan contemplated stepping in.
 </p>
 <p>
  But then.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sizzle…
 </p>
 <p>
  As Dongbang Sak placed the sword into the completed Taiji, smoke began to billow from it, and his face contorted into a deep frown.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Another failure…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Though he perfected the first stage of the Taiji Sword,
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak failed at the second stage, summoning the Taiji Sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Indeed, it’s tough.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing that even Dongbang Sak failed, Seong Jihan felt oddly reassured.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how extreme his talent in martial arts, completing this wasn’t easy.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But even Dongbang Sak didn’t think of mixing void into the Taiji Sword.’
 </p>
 <p>
  From Seong Jihan’s experience,
 </p>
 <p>
  at the second stage of the Taiji Sword, adding void and causing an explosion made it easier to wield.
 </p>
 <p>
  Creating the sword as Dongbang Sak did felt like creating something from nothing, which was difficult to grasp.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sigh… is this the best I can do? I truly am just a mediocre talent.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought it absurd that Dongbang Sak, of all people, would call himself a mediocre talent.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even after sealing the Red Demon and surviving 600 years… I can’t forge a sword to end the demonic path.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak lamented his increasingly aged appearance, caressing his face.
 </p>
 <p>
  Six hundred years.
 </p>
 <p>
  Could it be that he lived an additional 600 years since the Kang Sang era?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Did he extend his lifespan this far through his own martial arts before becoming a servant to the Martial God? He’s undoubtedly an extraordinary martial artist…’
 </p>
 <p>
  And the Taiji Sword was a mad skill, unreachable even after 600 years of dedication from such a martial artist.
 </p>
 <p>
  Recalling that Ashoka had once questioned his own talent,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He should see this.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He could show that even the greatest martial artist humanity had ever produced struggled for 600 years with the Taiji Sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Dongbang Sak sighed and stroked his thinning beard,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  red smoke began to rise around the World Tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Is it you again…?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Give up.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [We do not die…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Translucent giants’ heads appeared in the smoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak’s expression darkened upon seeing them.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They Appeared again, huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  As Dongbang Sak manipulated the flow of the Taiji in reverse,
 </p>
 <p>
  the giants’ heads were immediately sucked into it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Barely seconds after emerging, the giants’ heads vanished.
 </p>
 <p>
  Going further,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do not engage in foolishness.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak swung his sword at the red World Tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  A single strike of brilliant demonic energy sliced through all the branches
 </p>
 <p>
  and reached up into the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is the peak of the Crimson Divinity… I mastered it through martial soul.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike the Taiji Sword, Dongbang Sak’s understanding of the Crimson Divinity was apparent in his single strike.
 </p>
 <p>
  Feeling the demonic energy of the Crimson Divinity, it seemed this single strike was the ultimate form cultivated over 600 years.
 </p>
 <p>
  A single strike splitting the sky, One Sword Breaks the Sky,
 </p>
 <p>
  This was the culmination of Dongbang Sak’s Crimson Divinity perfected over those 600 years.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…The power is immense. This could be useful later.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Comfortably observing from within the tree, Seong Jihan absorbed the technique.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Whew…”
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">

 </div>
 <p>
  The World Tree, which had its branches cut by One Sword Breaks the Sky, began regenerating quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even splitting the heavens can’t fell a single tree. Should I accept his proposal…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak sighed, turning his back to leave.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the weary old man departed,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Watcher has left.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Would you like to break the seal?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The text reappeared, asking if he would like to break the seal.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Why is it so eager…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Complaining right after Dongbang Sak left,
 </p>
 <p>
  This World Tree seemed desperate to have its seal broken.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hold on. Let me assess the situation first.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I understand.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [If the master requires anything, please let me know at any time.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Accepting Seong Jihan’s decision to hold off, the red World Tree even referred to him as its master.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why do you call me your master?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You can read the inscription, and possess ‘Eternity.’]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You meet all necessary criteria to be my master.]
 </p>
 <p>
  So having the stat ‘Eternity’ and being able to read this peculiar text made him the master of the World Tree?
 </p>
 <p>
  “I see. Can I command you to do anything?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [In the sealed state, commands can only be carried out restrictively.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [To perform all commands, please break the seal.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Everything ties back to breaking the seal.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I won’t do it just yet.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, Seong Jihan had just gained the immensely powerful One Sword Breaks the Sky of the Crimson Divinity,
 </p>
 <p>
  And the World Tree’s persistent plea to break its seal made him reluctant to comply.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead, Seong Jihan decided to inquire about some curiosities.
 </p>
 <p>
  “These inscriptions, where are they from?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [They are the inscriptions of the master.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who is the master?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The master is the master.]
 </p>
 <p>
  This doesn’t help at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan also questioned the regeneration of the Red’s tribe’s heads, the source of the World Tree’s power, among other things.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This can only be answered if the seal is broken.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [This can only be answered if the seal is broken.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The World Tree continued to demand seal-breaking to provide answers.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It listens well but isn’t very useful.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Deciding to stop the futile questions, Seong Jihan crossed his arms and looked outside.
 </p>
 <p>
  The barren wasteland.
 </p>
 <p>
  After Dongbang Sak left, there wasn’t much to see here.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I don’t want to leave just yet, though.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The tree was the best hiding spot, the prime viewing seat for whatever was to unfold next.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll wait here for now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to stay put for a while.
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  How much time passed?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…This is getting boring.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The inside of the World Tree only offered a view of the wasteland.
 </p>
 <p>
  Staying here endlessly made Seong Jihan feel restless.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I could create a spectral head this time, but…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite Dongbang Sak’s earlier pruning through One Sword Breaks the Sky having its effect,
 </p>
 <p>
  the Red’s tribe’s heads hadn’t regenerated for a while.
 </p>
 <p>
  All that lay outside was the endless, barren red earth.
 </p>
 <p>
  For someone used to constant stimuli, gazing at an empty landscape was taxing.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The life energy here isn’t seeping in either.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Though the inside of the World Tree was saturated with life energy,
 </p>
 <p>
  it didn’t reach the internal space where Seong Jihan lay.
 </p>
 <p>
  To absorb the life energy, he had to leave the tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  But doing so would negate his reason for staying here.
 </p>
 <p>
  So Seong Jihan continued staring at the wasteland.
 </p>
 <p>
  In his idle state,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I feel peckish.’
 </p>
 <p>
  An unexpected thought crossed Seong Jihan’s mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  During intense training at the Void Training Room, he didn’t notice such trivial cravings.
 </p>
 <p>
  But here, without stimulation, his senses craved activity.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, got any fruit?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I will provide it.]
 </p>
 <p>
  For once, the World Tree didn’t mention breaking the seal.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  A red apple appeared before him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Previously, the World Tree’s fruit was a golden apple. This one’s red.”
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  [That one was lower-tier. This is high-grade.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The World Tree refuted, asserting this was superior.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite its ordinary appearance, akin to a market apple.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan chuckled and took a bite.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crunch.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he bit into the apple, flames erupted in his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Simultaneously,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan felt a slight increase in the energies of life and the stat Red within him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Oh…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  This apple stimulates two stats at once?
 </p>
 <p>
  It really is high-grade.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Eating it brings flames…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The apple’s energy was so intense that without the significant increase in his Red stat from the recent Boss Rush, the internal flames might have been unmanageable.
 </p>
 <p>
  But with his current high Red stat,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan could easily control the flames erupting with each bite.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crunch. Crunch.
 </p>
 <p>
  Finishing the apple, Seong Jihan asked the World Tree,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got more?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Give me a lot.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Understood.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud, thud, thud…
 </p>
 <p>
  As requested, a pile of apples materialized like a small mountain.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Getting used to this flavor might make regular meals unappetizing.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the common appearance, the taste within was otherworldly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Becoming addicted could make regular food taste like chewing on stones.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Doesn’t matter. Boosting stats while waiting is what’s important.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan devoured the World Tree’s fruit without pausing.
 </p>
 <p>
  After consuming about half the pile,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stat ‘Eternity’ increased by 1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stat ‘Red’ increased by 1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The hardest stat to increase, Eternity, had grown.
 </p>
 <p>
  Following closely, the Red stat also increased.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Eternity increasing like this… I need to consume all the World Tree fruit.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing his stats grow encouraged Seong Jihan to speed up.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Are you alright? The apple contains the power of the Red…]
 </p>
 <p>
  The World Tree, concerned, displayed texts.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m fine.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Indeed, you are the master.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Do you have more?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Creating the World Tree’s fruit takes a year. Breaking the seal can shorten this time.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…There’s that seal-breaking talk again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The persistent World Tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ignoring its plea, Seong Jihan consumed all the fruit.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Eternity and Red increased by a total of 3 each.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Given he only sat inside a tree and ate fruit, the gains were substantial.
 </p>
 <p>
  His smile broadening as he checked his stat screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Watcher approaching.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Third party approaching.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Breaking the seal is recommended after they leave.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Again, urgent messages appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not planning to break it yet, Seong Jihan was curious about this third party.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Who could this be?’
 </p>
 <p>
  He looked out at the wasteland again.
 </p>
 <p>
  There, he saw,
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The significantly older Dongbang Sak,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Dongbang Sak, have you reconsidered?”
 </p>
 <p>
  and a young man with striking, refined features standing with a smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  A youthful face, long black hair.
 </p>
 <p>
  Someone Seong Jihan had seen once before.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Ashoka?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka and Dongbang Sak already had a connection during this time.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
 </p>
 <p>
  Finding this auspicious, Seong Jihan intended to observe further.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Though I am confined here, I have learned a bit about you. They say you are highly revered in Tianzhu…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, excuse me, but please wait a moment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Cutting Dongbang Sak off,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka walked steadily toward the World Tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, quietly,
 </p>
 <p>
  “…A guest is still inside, isn’t he?”
 </p>
 <p>
  he stared directly at Seong Jihan’s eyes.

  Chapter 396

 <p>
  Chapter 396
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s eyes gleamed with interest.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka.
 </p>
 <p>
  He knew this man was extraordinary, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘To think he noticed what even Dongbang Sak couldn’t.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Though Dongbang Sak had lived 600 years longer than in his prime during the Kang Sang era, and his martial arts had definitely grown stronger, he had also become senile.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sword he had casually unleashed, One Sword Breaks the Sky, was a supreme technique that even the current Seong Jihan would find difficult to handle.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, what Dongbang Sak had failed to notice, Ashoka had perceived immediately upon arrival.
 </p>
 <p>
  “A guest, could it be…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This person is inside the tree. Would you please come out?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Step aside. I’ll draw them out myself.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka spoke with conviction.
 </p>
 <p>
  And behind him, Dongbang Sak was raising his fighting spirit with a terrifying expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing his momentum, Seong Jihan roughly gauged his strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘At Dongbang Sak’s current level, he should still be a worthy opponent…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Though he had progressed significantly compared to his prime in the Kang Sang era,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan had also become much stronger since unlocking the outer formation of the Nine Palace Eight Trigrams.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, his opponent had not perfected the Taiji Sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  All the martial arts Dongbang Sak used could be learned through martial soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, while fighting him carried some risk, it seemed worth a try.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But Ashoka poses a problem.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka, who had instantly pinpointed Seong Jihan’s location.
 </p>
 <p>
  The extent of his power was completely immeasurable.
 </p>
 <p>
  Recalling their previous encounter during the succession ceremony, he was certainly an extraordinary existence back then as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  But apart from reversing time, he hadn’t really displayed anything overwhelming in terms of martial prowess.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment,
 </p>
 <p>
  [This is an emergency. Please release the seal immediately.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Text urgently appeared before Seong Jihan’s eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  The red World Tree, which had only been advising to release the seal until now, had raised its tone by a level.
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you release the seal, I can immediately expel the two from this space. Now is the time for a decision.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Releasing the seal sure enables a lot.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, after a brief contemplation, Seong Jihan decided,
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, I’ll go out and meet them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He chose to encounter the two.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I release the seal, it feels like everything here will come to an end…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Before this world reset itself,
 </p>
 <p>
  He needed to find out what Ashoka and Dongbang Sak had schemed together during this time period.
 </p>
 <p>
  But as Seong Jihan tried to exit,
 </p>
 <p>
  Rumble…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The space inside the tree shook, and the area Seong Jihan could move in grew narrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You cannot leave until you release the seal.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The red World Tree revealed its true colors.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan smiled wryly at this.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, I actually don’t know the release code, you know?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I know you know it.]
 </p>
 <p>
  No, I really don’t, yet it insists obstinately.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Then I’ll have to break through by force.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan drew upon the power of the Crimson Divinity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps because he had gained so many stats from the Red Administrator’s hand,
 </p>
 <p>
  The flames, far more intense than before, burned the tree to ashes.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This power… To think you can control the Crimson Divinity so well…]
 </p>
 <p>
  The World Tree tried to regenerate itself with a powerful life force,
 </p>
 <p>
  But the crimson flames did not allow it to recover.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the tree that had repeatedly tried to block his path burned to ashes,
 </p>
 <p>
  [As expected of the master… I shall open the path.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The red World Tree gave up its resistance and opened the space on its own.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  Beyond the cleared space,
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Who are you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak glared at him, emanating a murderous aura.
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to his prime in the Kang Sang era, he had a haggard appearance, the leisurely air gone from this old man.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the killing intent he exuded was incomparably sharp.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment,
 </p>
 <p>
  Step. Step.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please calm your excitement for a moment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka stepped in front of the agitated Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This guest is precisely the reason and result of the ‘proposal’ I made to you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He is…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Ashoka’s words, Dongbang Sak, his killing intent subsiding briefly,
 </p>
 <p>
  Looked at Seong Jihan.
 </p>

 <p>
  “…He seems lacking to entrust with that great task.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But he found his way here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The two exchanged meaningful words among themselves, nodding their heads.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned at them.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stop talking about things only you two know, and fill me in too, Ashoka.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ashoka? Is that my name?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan said that to Ashoka, his eyes widened slightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…That bastard. He doesn’t even know your name properly. Can we trust him?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, I grow more certain. Let me ask again. Is that my name in the ‘future’?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The future?
 </p>
 <p>
  The fact that he had immediately found Seong Jihan’s location earlier, too.
 </p>
 <p>
  He certainly seemed to be on a different trajectory in this sealed world.
 </p>
 <p>
  But judging from his reaction, was Ashoka’s original name something else?
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Yes. You were called Ashoka. What is your current name?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s go with Ashoka.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As he said that, he looked at Dongbang Sak, putting a finger to his lips.
 </p>
 <p>
  Signaling him not to say anything.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing that, Dongbang Sak gave a fake cough.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ahem… Yes, Ashoka. He is Ashoka.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Making a fuss over a name when you don’t even know his real one.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There must be a reason my future self deliberately changed my name. I simply trust my own judgment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Future… How are you so certain I’m from the future?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka looked around, smiling.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Because this place is a virtual space sealing Dongbang Sak’s memories and the World Tree.”
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wh-What do you mean…? Saying this place is a virtual space.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Haven’t you been vaguely suspecting it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  In response to Dongbang Sak’s question, Ashoka spoke with a smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Try to recall your memories in detail. Before he arrived, was time actually passing in this space?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  “And how could a guest from the future come when you haven’t even accepted my proposal yet?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Dongbang Sak listened to Ashoka’s words with a grave expression,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  He suddenly drew his sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I still cannot trust him. Martial artists must converse through their weapons to understand each other. I must test him.”
 </p>
 <p>
  What?
 </p>
 <p>
  So in the end, he wants to fight?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan smiled, looking at Dongbang Sak raising his fighting spirit.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’d rather appreciate that. Dongbang Sak, please upgrade my martial arts.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I just learned this inside the tree.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  The sword Eclipse bloomed in Seong Jihan’s hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fundamental Divine Arts,
 </p>
 <p>
  Heavenly Dark Shadow Technique:
 </p>
 <p>
  One Sword Breaks the Sky
 </p>
 <p>
  As the tip of the dark sword pierced through a space,
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack!
 </p>
 <p>
  In the world beyond Dongbang Sak,
 </p>
 <p>
  Sword marks were engraved everywhere.
 </p>
 <p>
  A deep void left traces in the sky and earth, slowly fading away.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing this, Dongbang Sak’s expression stiffened more than ever before.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The essence of One Sword Breaks the Sky lies not in splitting the heavens, but in perfectly annihilating a single point.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The collapse of the sky is merely a secondary result of the excessive power contained in a single strike.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You sure know a lot.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  Ten swords hovering around Dongbang Sak flew over,
 </p>
 <p>
  Their tips squarely aimed at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Go on, keep using that meager skill of yours.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t hold back your martial arts. I’ll learn them all.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You bastard…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak approached with a pale face, his killing intent flashing.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, shall I take everything he’s got?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s eyes sparkled as he crossed swords with him.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  2 hours later.
 </p>

 <p>
  The world inside the Nine Palace Eight Trigrams, once barren,
 </p>
 <p>
  Was now completely devastated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom! Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  Explosions erupted from all directions,
 </p>
 <p>
  And the earth was dug up everywhere except where the World Tree was planted.
 </p>
 <p>
  And,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  An old man and a young man, stepping on the ground in the same way.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak’s face turned scarlet as he saw Seong Jihan using the same footwork as him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You took even this!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, the light steps were already taught to me by the future Dongbang Sak. Try using something else.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hah…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But as expected, the future Dongbang Sak is still better at using martial arts. There’s not much for me to learn here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not much to learn, you say…!?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Unable to contain his anger at the smirking youth, Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he tried to use more power,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Dongbang Sak, don’t you think this much is enough to acknowledge him?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka, who had been leisurely watching their fight, spoke up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not yet!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your martial artist’s pride is truly inflamed. Hmm, well… he seems to have already learned a lot from your future self, so why don’t you try using that sword instead?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That sword, you mean…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The sword that destroys souls.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At those words, deep wrinkles formed between Dongbang Sak’s brows.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…The Taiji Sword is incomplete.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I couldn’t learn that from you in the future either. Teach it to me this once.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “M-My future self… completed it…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, he drew out the sword of light.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The sword of light…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  At those words, suddenly suppressing his fighting spirit,
 </p>
 <p>
  “The sword of light… Have I been thinking wrongly?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak sat down cross-legged.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  His body floated up on its own, and the ten swords began to circle around him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What, instant enlightenment?’
 </p>
 <p>
  He asked him to teach him how to use the Taiji Sword, but he entered his own world just from hearing about the sword of light.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan looked at him dumbfounded,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I observed your conversation well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka approached Seong Jihan with a smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka, who had no dust on his clothes despite the explosions all around.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan closely observed his appearance.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I deliberately let a few attacks slip by, but he blocked them completely…’
 </p>
 <p>
  To gauge Ashoka’s power, he had launched a few sword energies at him while fighting Dongbang Sak,
 </p>
 <p>
  But Seong Jihan’s attacks disappeared in an instant before even reaching him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “As expected, there was a reason my future self chose you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, the future you said my talent was ambiguous.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Calling this talent ambiguous… I suppose the opponent has become that much stronger.”
 </p>
 <p>
  By ‘opponent,’ he probably meant the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking that, Seong Jihan asked Ashoka,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now, would you mind telling me what you’ve been scheming?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright. I suppose I can tell you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka looked at the red World Tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  The World Tree that had regenerated instantly despite Seong Jihan and Dongbang Sak’s clash.
 </p>
 <p>
  “In the near future, that will ignite a conflagration that will engulf this planet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A conflagration… You mean the red World Tree?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. A fierce blaze that no human will be able to survive.”
 </p>
 <p>
  That World Tree possesses such destructive power?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the red World Tree with a dubious expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  After burning it a bit with the Crimson Divinity, it had opened the path on its own,
 </p>
 <p>
  So he didn’t think it would display such overwhelming destructive force.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It could be different if the seal is released.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The red World Tree that kept asking him to release the seal.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he had done as it said, it might have exhibited a different output than what he saw now.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan gazed at the red World Tree,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka continued,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I persuaded the one trying to cause the conflagration through the World Tree. I told him there was a better way than that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You… persuaded him?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. I said, wouldn’t it be a waste to use and discard humanity only once?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  Behind Ashoka’s back, a golden wheel rose.
 </p>
 <p>
  The one used by his future self.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike the Golden Wheel’s eerie appearance with a golden skull and red bones,
 </p>
 <p>
  This wheel was dazzling,CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
 </p>
 <p>
  And felt sacred.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I said I would keep turning back time to the past. So I asked him to postpone the destruction.”

 <p>
  Chapter 398
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recalled what Ashoka had said before upon seeing his stiffened face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Taiji Sword is Dongbang Sak’s supreme technique, but… you don’t necessarily have to follow his path all the way to the Taiji sword.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Dongbang Sak had to pursue immortality, so he had to intentionally exclude the void from the Taiji sword.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But if you don’t intend to live forever, it’s natural for the void to be included in the Taiji sword.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you complete the Void Taiji Sword, you have to give up immortality. The World Tree inside you will also crack and eventually collapse.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan relayed this to Ashoka, he fell silent.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you’re not going to live forever, use the void. Did I really say that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…My future self was trying to sacrifice you. If you complete the taiji sword, will only the World Tree really disappear?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka continued with a serious expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even the World Tree inside will shatter due to the Taiji sword. Naturally, your original body won’t be able to endure it either.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve also thought about trying to use the void… that power, but I knew I would die if I used it, so I haven’t attempted it yet. My life may not be precious, but if I die, the Blood Tribe will run rampant again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak, who had been watching Seong Jihan’s Taiji with interest, also explained why he hadn’t used the void.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the end, their point was that the Void Taiji Sword wouldn’t precisely strike only the World Tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  The void would devour Seong Jihan’s body as well, and the more he used the sword,
 </p>
 <p>
  He would eventually collapse along with it…
 </p>
 <p>
  Isn’t that what they mean?
 </p>
 <p>
  “But I’m still fine so far.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How could that be… Do you have no abnormalities in your body at all?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, it’s rather good when the void disappears.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The void disappears…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. It’s an ability that’s too troublesome if it grows too much. If I put it in there, it disappears.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Is that so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s words, Ashoka fell into deep thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm. So you… will continue cultivating this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have to.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not a matter of immortality, but you might die at any moment if you keep using it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll think about that when the time comes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha, you’re truly a fellow without a plan…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak shook his head at that answer,
 </p>
 <p>
  But Seong Jihan had his own thoughts.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I still don’t think this will harm me at all.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps because the sword’s completion level was still low.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were no cases where the Taiji sword directly threatened Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather, it was a useful means to eliminate the overflowing void.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, he didn’t know what would happen if the Taiji Sword developed further and its effects became more powerful.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s think about it when we reach that stage.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to continue training the Taiji Sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  “For now, I’ll try using it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hahaha…! Is that so? You don’t seem to have any intention of giving up. Then, may I give you some advice?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sure. Please guide me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, let’s take a look first. Inside the Taiji…”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan unhesitatingly said he would learn, Dongbang Sak approached him with sparkling eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  During the Kang Sang era, he had only conceptualized the Taiji Sword,
 </p>
 <p>
  But now, after 600 more years of cultivation, his understanding of the sword had increased, so he was giving Seong Jihan more efficient guidance.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Ashoka watched Seong Jihan and Dongbang Sak with a complex expression,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Please… release the seal…]
 </p>
 <p>
  In front of the red World Tree, text endlessly appeared urging the release of the seal.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  The effect of Dongbang Sak’s one-point lesson was tremendous.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Void decreases by 5.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the void decreased, the Taiji sword revealed itself inside the Taiji.
 </p>
 <p>
  What Seong Jihan had successfully materialized in front of Ashoka was merely the sword’s hilt,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  But what appeared inside the Taiji this time was the size of a small dagger.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing this, Dongbang Sak nodded his head in satisfaction.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…This much means it has gained a decent form.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Taiji Sword, which had evolved from a hilt to a dagger, was a pitiful size compared to the sword of light Dongbang Sak had drawn out before.
 </p>
 <p>
  But he still showed satisfaction upon seeing it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the form was lacking,
 </p>
 <p>
  The destructive power contained within it held the soul-destroying force that Dongbang Sak had pursued for a long time.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘When he directly sticks to me and tutors, it works right away.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was said that the reason the Martial God originally wanted to abandon Earth and create a new species was because of Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  He truly possessed transcendent talent in martial arts.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  ‘But if he can complete it this quickly, couldn’t Dongbang Sak have just completed the taiji sword with the void?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought that while looking at Dongbang Sak, who had helped him create a dagger even without the star buff.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But it’s really peculiar that your body doesn’t collapse. If I had drawn out this sword, I would have perished immediately.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead, Dongbang Sak was looking at Seong Jihan with curiosity.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. That’s why I couldn’t even attempt to create a taiji sword with this power. Hmm… I can’t even guess how it’s possible.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, I have various powers, but fundamentally, I’m an ordinary human.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha. If you were an ordinary human, humanity would have already defeated all the Blood Tribe on their own.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak, who snorted at Seong Jihan’s words, pointed his finger at the red World Tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, since you’ve completed the sword, how about experimenting on that fellow?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You mean the World Tree?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right. This world is a sealed world of the past, right? The future is already set anyway, so let me vent my grudge here. I want to see that monstrosity shatter a bit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded at those words.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since the tutor had perfectly provided 1:1 lessons, he should fulfill his wish.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud. Thud.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan approached the red World Tree with the Void Dagger,
 </p>
 <p>
  [No, Master! Please release the seal quickly!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The roots of the World Tree rose from the ground, breaking on their own to form text.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright. I’ll release the seal too. But let me strike it once to see if it works.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master!!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “But why am I your master? When did we meet?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Don’t you possess the Crimson Divinity and Eternity?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who’s your master? Gilgamesh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [No. Could it be that you don’t know…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh isn’t the master?
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Then the code he taught me is a dud, isn’t it?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking that, Seong Jihan raised the dagger.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Mist spread from the red World Tree, and the ghost heads of giants appeared, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  [This… this power…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Aaaargh…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  They were helplessly sucked into the dagger Seong Jihan was holding and disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh… Those annoying ghosts completely vanish.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Indeed, they’re being annihilated.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The power most suitable for a Taiji sword was the void after all.”
 </p>
 <p>
  And as they stood behind, Dongbang Sak and Ashoka judged that the Blood Tribe had definitely been annihilated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, seeing this, the red World Tree created text even faster than before.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master! Please spare me! Didn’t I give you the World Tree’s fruit earlier…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah. That? I’m grateful for that. But you should have given me more.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I, I’ll give you more!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud thud thud thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as Seong Jihan’s words ended, apples rapidly grew from the tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  They fell in front of him in a shower.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just a moment ago, it had clearly said,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It takes 1 year for the World Tree’s fruit to be produced. This time will be shortened if the seal is released.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It said it would take 1 year to create them again.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a lie after all.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I don’t have time to eat, but I should collect them for now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The duration of the Taiji Sword wasn’t very long.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he ate the fruits, the Taiji Sword might disappear.
 </p>
 <p>
  After sweeping hundreds of apples dropped by the World Tree into his inventory, Seong Jihan said,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thanks.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hey! I gave them to you!!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s why I’m thanking you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He raised the sword and stabbed it into the tree trunk.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  The tree instantly turned purple.
 </p>
 <p>
  Cracks immediately formed on the tree’s bark.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pop…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The World Tree, the end of the tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  It began to split from the leaves.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stop. Stop. Stop. Please, Master. This is wrong. Please release the seal…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow, you’re persistent too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  How many times is it going to mention releasing the seal?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, ignoring the World Tree’s struggle, thrust the sword in deeply.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sizzle…
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, following the leaves, the branches disappeared.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  The lush appearance of the red World Tree rapidly shrank.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That monstrosity isn’t regenerating…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Taiji Sword is clearly effective. However,”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka, who had been closely observing the tree’s disappearance, continued,
 </p>
 <p>
  “If we destroy the World Tree like this, the seal on this world may not be released.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You said Dongbang Sak’s memories in the real world will return if the seal is released… Can’t it be released by destroying it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can’t be certain about that. You seem to know something about releasing the seal… Will you try experimenting?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That code might be wrong.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It doesn’t matter.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Tap. Tap.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka smiled and caressed the golden wheel behind his back.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If we turn back time, it’ll be fine.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You mean save and load first?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Save, load?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s such a thing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The golden wheel that turns back time.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how you look at it, that seems the most unfair.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well then, shall I use that cheat item?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan pulled out the dagger stuck in the tree and wrote the code Gilgamesh had taught him next to it.
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s time to behead the snake.]
 </p>
 <p>
  And as soon as that phrase was written,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash! Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  The red World Tree flickered with a red light.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Gilgamesh. You thought they lent you authority… but the authority has already been completely transferred to me.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside, the Martial God’s voice was heard.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Disappear. My foolish customer.]
 </p>
 <p>
  We wrote the code to behead the snake,
 </p>
 <p>
  But the one being beheaded is us…
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, a message appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have written a fake code.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The sealed world will be deleted.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Along with the message that the world would be deleted,
 </p>
 <p>
  Dozens, hundreds of destruction codes began to be written on the tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  The destruction codes quickly spread throughout.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the world was covered in red characters of annihilation, Seong Jihan frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…That bastard Gilgamesh. He’s useless. Really.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was strange from the moment the World Tree said Gilgamesh wasn’t the master.
 </p>
 <p>
  Is this the result after all?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at Ashoka and signaled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll go back to a moment ago.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Rumble…
 </p>
 <p>
  As the golden wheel turned in reverse,
 </p>
 <p>
  Time went back to the point before Seong Jihan wrote the code.
 </p>
 <p>
  And at the same time,
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack. Crack…
 </p>
 <p>
  The golden wheel cracked and shattered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Was that a one-time use?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Originally, it’s not, but the flow we went against this time was too immense.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed.
 </p>
 <p>
  If we had made a mistake, the whole world would have been covered in destruction codes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Overturning that wouldn’t have been an easy task.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I see… There’s no next save and load chance. Then I’ll just destroy it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master!!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Poof!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan ignored the World Tree’s text and thrust the sword deeper.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master…]
 </p>
 <p>
  The red World Tree displayed one last character and disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the world darkened, and a message appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The inner formation of the Nine Palace Eight Trigrams collapses, releasing the Six Unions, Five Elements, and Four Symbols.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Fragment of the Sealed World Tree-2’ is destroyed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You obtain the lingering energy from the destroyed World Tree fragment.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The stat ‘Eternity’ increases by 10.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The stat ‘Red’ increases by 10.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This was the pillar of the seal after all.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The inner formation collapses as the World Tree is destroyed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ’10 each is a hefty increase.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If he ate the apples he collected earlier, what he gained from coming here today would be considerable.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was calculating his gains here,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ding…
 </p>
 <p>
  [The proficiency of the Taiji Sword has increased, and the ‘Gift – Mark of the Taiji Sword’ disappears.]
 </p>
 <p>
  An unexpected message appeared.

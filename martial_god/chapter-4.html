  Bronze League – Gangnam 1 Area Tutorial
 </p>
 <p>
  “Finally, is it today?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Hoo. Hoo.
 </p>
 <p>
  Newbie bronze player, Dohyukgyu, let out a sigh of relief as he relaxed his tension.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s going to go well. I’m lucky, after all.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dohyukgyu looked at his status window.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gift: Agility A (Rank A)
 </p>
 <p>
  -Agility is 25.
 </p>
 <p>
  -This ability ignores the league’s stat limits.
 </p>
 <p>
  Agility A.
 </p>
 <p>
  A simple gift with a rank attached to the stat, but it was highly regarded due to its benefit of bypassing the league’s stat limits.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This changed my life when I got this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Do Hyukgyu still vividly remembered his 18th birthday.
 </p>
 <p>
  Back then, awakening as a player, a gift that only a tiny fraction could obtain.
 </p>
 <p>
  Who would’ve thought he would get it!
 </p>
 <p>
  And not only that, he got it as an A-rank.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Tell the lottery to take a hike.”
 </p>
 <p>
  That day, a banner hung in the neighborhood, “Mr. Do Hyukgyu. Awakened with an A-rank gift!” It was even more celebrated than a neighbor entering Seoul National University!
 </p>
 <p>
  And then, scouts from top domestic corporations and guilds came to him with offers, even more so than his neighborhood mate getting into a prestigious university.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the end, he was able to join the guild “Divergent,” affiliated with the Divergent Group.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It was enjoyable.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The guild provided him with a studio apartment in Gangnam.
 </p>
 <p>
  When he commuted to and from the guild in their uniform, numerous people would turn to look at him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since turning 18 and receiving the gift, his life had truly solidified.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I’ll somehow make it to the top 50.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, the remaining task was to survive in this Bronze League Gangnam 1 Area.
 </p>
 <p>
  Do Hyukgyu gripped his sword tightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can do it, I can do it…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Before the battle began, he looked around his surroundings.
 </p>
 <p>
  A threatening horde of monsters.
 </p>
 <p>
  And other players from different guilds, marked with corporate logos on their armor, caught his eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That one is from LK. That one is from SG… That one is from Handae Guild. None of them are easy opponents.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed, Gangnam 1 Area.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were all from major corporations.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing formidable opponents, sweat dripped from Do Hyukgyu’s hand as he gripped his sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment, a player was summoned near him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What’s this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  A man wearing shorts and a t-shirt, with disheveled hair as if he had just woken up, and no weapon in his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing that sight, Do Hyukgyu immediately realized his identity.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That… That’s a player who accidentally ended up in Gangnam 1!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Originally, no one would think of participating in this area.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, in the world of humans, mistakes did happen from time to time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even in the well-organized Korean league system.
 </p>
 <p>
  Accidental awakenings who reached level 2 in Gangnam 1 like a drought relief were not uncommon.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Normally, you should wait for the player who came in by mistake to give up the game…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Leaving the player who entered by mistake alone until they press the game forfeit button.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s the rule and courtesy of Gangnam 1 Area.
 </p>
 <p>
  However…
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m lucky!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I could get one kill point for free.
 </p>
 <p>
  What use were such trivial rules and courtesies?
 </p>
 <p>
  Do Hyukgyu’s eyes gleamed ominously.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then…
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tutorial is starting.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Eliminate opponents until 50 players survive.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Thump! Thump! Thump!
 </p>
 <p>
  The powerful sound of a drum signaled the start, and as his tense body relaxed…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now’s the time!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Tatadak-!
 </p>
 <p>
  Do Hyukgyu swiftly approached the man, drawing his sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before pressing forfeit, he had to kill!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Agility A gift came into play, Do Hyukgyu’s body shot forward like an arrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  And just before the tip of his sword touched the man’s chest.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sword didn’t move.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kwaack.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the blink of an eye, the edge of the sword was lodged between the man’s index and middle fingers.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  “Last time, I died like this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sung Jihan looked at the young man who had stabbed him with a sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was quite fast for level 2.
 </p>
 <p>
  Probably because his gift was agility-related.
 </p>
 <p>
  No wonder he couldn’t do anything last time and died.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ik. Eek…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, Do Hyukgyu struggled to pull the sword from Sung Jihan’s grip.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the sword still didn’t budge.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What kind of strength is this…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  His strength stat was 9. Not a low value by any means, yet the sword’s blade held between just two fingers remained absolutely steady.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I should give you time to log out. You lack manners.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Y-You… What’s this? How can you be faster than my A-rank agility ?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A-rank agility? How did you manage to come to Gangnam 1 with that kind of ability?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sung Jihan looked at Do Hyukgyu with astonished eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  A-rank agility, Such an ancient artifact-like gift…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh. This is the past, right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Before Sung Jihan could react, Do Hyukgyu wore an expression of disbelief.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What? You’re saying my A-rank agility is that kind of ability?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, I won’t deny it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Stat-boosting gift.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was meant to help with early-game survival in Bronze, but it becomes useless even in Gold League.
 </p>
 <p>
  But for someone like this to participate in Gangnam 1…
 </p>
 <p>
  Feeling like he had traveled back in time, Sung Jihan relaxed the grip of his fingers.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a result, Do Hyukgyu, who was struggling to pull out the sword, tumbled backward.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Argh…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Do Hyukgyu hastily got back up, his face flushed red.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had ambitiously tried to secure a kill and start strong, but what was this situation?
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m done for!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  As if determined to retaliate for this humiliation, he swung the sword haphazardly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, Sung Jihan effortlessly sidestepped the wild swings with an expression of boredom.
 </p>
 <p>
  The opponent was definitely faster than him, despite his Weakness 5 stat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, what can you do? I can see your trajectory clearly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When you know the start and end of a sword’s movement, it’s easy to bridge the speed gap.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now I should finish this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sung Jihan had made up his mind to break the achievement gradually.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  This time, Do Hyukgyu’s sword, which was swung forcefully, found its mark.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  At the moment when he was sure it had landed successfully.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  Sung Jihan’s hands moved swiftly as he caught the sword in reverse.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  He had definitely been gripping the sword firmly in his hand.

   Do Hyukgyu was about to say something, but his body soon shone white and disappeared.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   He had been dealt a fatal blow and received the death verdict.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   Sung Jihan stared at that sight silently.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>

   “What a nice world. Not dying or anything.”
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   The same applied to the sword he was holding, belonging to Do Hyukgyu.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   Perhaps this was because of the current Battle Net being a ‘game’.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   No matter how much he took the sword away, complete seizure wasn’t possible.

  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   “I guess I’ll just use the weapon by taking it away.”
  </a>

   “Good.”
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a a="" helscans<="" href="#" target="_blank">
   Generally, killing monsters in the Colosseum map was considered inefficient.

 <p>

  </a>
 </p>
 <p>

   Three out of the five leading Orc brandished their hand axes and hurled them at Sung Jihan.

   Could they have thought that this would be enough against the reckless human?

 <p>
  “… What kind of contract?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “When I reach Silver League, I plan to create a guild… You just need to be a guild member there for a year.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re creating a guild?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Masied’s eyes widened.
 </p>
 <p>
  While it’s possible to establish a guild once you’ve achieved the qualifications of Silver League, very few in Silver League actually established guilds.
 </p>
 <p>
  BattleNet has been established for 10 years already. Who would create a guild in Silver League these days?
 </p>
 <p>
  If it weren’t for Seong Jihan saying it, he would have thought it was some kind of scam.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But… he must have a reason.’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Considering the remarkable capabilities Seong Jihan has demonstrated so far, he must have a grand plan.’
 </p>
 <p>
  That was Masied’s speculation.
 </p>
 <p>
  He never thought Seong Jihan would establish a guild just for Achievement Points.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m
 </p>
 <p>
  “… So, just one year will do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. I’ll even pay a monthly salary. Of course, if you want to stay longer, you’re welcome to.”
 </p>
 <p>
  This was an incredibly generous offer.
 </p>
 <p>
  Given Masied’s current situation, even if a 5 or 10-year indentured contract was proposed, he would have no choice but to accept.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, Seong Jihan only asked for a year.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why… are you being so kind to me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Masied asked with a trembling voice, Seong Jihan confidently replied,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Because I know you’ll become the best Mage.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I won’t tie down the best player with a multi-year contract.”
 </p>
 <p>
  From the start, the guild establishment was just to receive the Guild Master Achievement.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan never seriously considered continuing to run it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘And it’s better to have Masied owe me one.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Having the world’s best Mage owe him one was ultimately what Seong Jihan wanted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can’t… understand. How do you see that I’ll become the best Mage with this useless gift…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Masied, can you gather 500 million?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…No.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right? Just use me then. There’s no way you’ll lose out, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well… you probably don’t have money either. I heard you’re commuting using an old car.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan laughed bitterly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The power of the media.
 </p>
 <p>
  It hadn’t been long since he commuted to the academy using that car, but even the busy Masied knew about it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Money isn’t a problem.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan switched the screen on his smartphone.
 </p>
 <p>
  From the BattleNet market to a betting site.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you know there’s a Korea-Japan match today?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I do. I even bet my salary on it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…You too?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Sorry to Korea, but I bet on a 3:0 win for Japan. I have to earn at least 10%.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The odds for a 3:0 win for Japan were 1.1.
 </p>
 <p>
  [PR/N: The odds being 1.1 means you’ll get 110% of the money you bet. This is why Masied says he’ll earn 10%.]
 </p>
 <p>
  It was evident that many people were confident in Japan’s victory.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No need to apologize. But, sorry to say, the world is often unreasonable.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan grinned and showed his betting record.
 </p>
 <p>
  Masied was shocked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you crazy?! Making such a wild bet…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Haha. Does it seem crazy?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Beep!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan turned on the TV in the private room.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the screen, BattleNet players preparing for a match were captured by the camera.
 </p>
 <p>
  “From now on, I’ll show you the sight of money being multiplied.”
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  The odds for a 3:0 win for Japan were 1.1.
 </p>
 <p>
  The public’s judgment was entirely reasonable.
 </p>
 <p>
  The key player of the Korean national team, Sword King, had moved to Japan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not just a halving of the team’s strength, but it had been added to the enemy.
 </p>
 <p>
  The power dynamic shifted from 1:1 to 0.5:1.5.
 </p>
 <p>
  As long as Sword King played in every match, a crushing defeat was expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s… impossible…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sometimes, the world was unreasonable.
 </p>
 <p>
  During the Korea-Japan Match 1st Game
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">

 <p>
  As the vanguard for the Japanese national team, the Sword King, Ito Ryuhei got into a verbal altercation with his Japanese teammates, who he suddenly found himself paired with.
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you won’t listen to me, I won’t play.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Then suddenly, he began to strip off his armor and started cutting himself with his twin swords.
 </p>
 <p>
  In no time, his shirt was torn to shreds, revealing bloody cuts on his muscular upper body.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why… why is he doing that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I wonder.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ito!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [What are you doing?!]
 </p>
 <p>
  While Japanese players were trying to stop the Sword King in shock,
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’re in my way.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sword King, speaking fluent Japanese, pushed away his Japanese teammates and charged alone towards the Korean national team.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Block him!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Not sure why, but this is our chance!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Korean national team, surprised by the Sword King’s sudden madness, focused their fire on him.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, even though the Sword King had taken off his armor, he still held twin swords in his hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Too weak.]
 </p>
 <p>
  His twin swords, gleaming blue, moved fluidly.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hmph…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  He easily neutralized the attacks from the Korean national team’s dealers.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the SSS-rank Gift of Twin Sword Mastery, his sword movements alone overwhelmed the Korean national team.
 </p>
 <p>
  With or without armor, he was the world’s best warrior, after all.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He’s indeed strong.’
 </p>
 <p>
  National team members are essentially superhumans who have reached at least the Diamond League.
 </p>
 <p>
  Their match footage, accessible to the general public, is shown in slow motion.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Mages and Supports, who aren’t as physically adept, move slowly on camera,
 </p>
 <p>
  Only the Sword King moved at a breakneck pace.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘With that speed… even with my martial arts, it won’t be easy.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In Seong Jihan’s previous life, he had never faced the Sword King.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sword King, Ito Ryuhei, the best warrior who reigned the starting era of BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had disappeared suddenly when half of the world’s countries vanished in the later era of BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, Seong Jihan, referred to as the strongest warrior in the later era, had never crossed swords with the Sword King.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Seong Jihan showed no sign of concern.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’m completely different now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  While acknowledging the Sword King’s strength, Seong Jihan never thought he would lose to him.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Sword Flight Technique.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A blue sword landed at the Sword King’s feet.
 </p>
 <p>
  Serving as a stand, it sped through the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  The technique to fly by manipulating a sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  The pinnacle of sword techniques, once displayed by an ally, was now showcased by an enemy.
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s a Sword Flight Technique!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Cast protective magic…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Sword King’s strength was well known to the Korean team.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sword Flight was not just about flying; it was the epitome of breaking through enemy defenses.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a flurry, the team attempted to cast protective spells.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Still too slow.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sword King had become a massive meteor, plummeting down.
 </p>
 <p>
  The speed difference was stark.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  The protective barrier conjured by the Korean Supports was torn apart.
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside, the Sword King landed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Right in front of the most vital players, the Supports.
 </p>
 <p>
  Step! Step!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sword King walked slowly.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Block him! Form a scrum!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Warriors formed a line to protect the Supports.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  [Argh…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  With one swing of his twin swords, they were all blown away.
 </p>
 <p>
  The difference in strength was evident. Sword King was unstoppable.
 </p>
 <p>
  Throughout his advance to the core of the Korean Team, he didn’t have a single injury except for the self-inflicted ones.
 </p>
 <p>
  At this rate, they would be defeated overwhelmingly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Korea-Japan match on August 15th…
 </p>
 <p>
  It would be cruelly trampled upon by someone who was once Korean.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Crazy! What’s with this Sword King guy?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why… Why has he become stronger?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This isn’t even a game anymore…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Loud exclamations echoed even inside the soundproofed private room from the restaurant’s patrons.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

 <p>
  Everyone expected a loss, but not a humiliating game like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despair descended upon South Korea.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ah…! The national team players must fight! Even if the Sword King is in front of them, the Supports cannot be left to die in vain!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [But… we can’t stop him. He has… become stronger.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Uh…! If we’re completely defeated in the first game, we’ll be caught off guard in the next game! If we’re dominated by one person like this, we won’t stand a chance in not just the invade map, but any other map!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The commentators on TV shouted in frustration, but before long, the Sword King had approached where the Supports were.
 </p>
 <p>
  The game was essentially over by then.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the first target of the Sword King, Support Lee Jin-Wook, desperately struggled like a bug being crushed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [D-Divine Punishment!]
 </p>
 <p>
  A hammer of light formed in the air and dropped towards the Sword King.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Support’s attack spell, Divine Punishment. It was a powerful skill for a Support, but to someone like the Sword King, it merely tickled.
 </p>
 <p>
  People resigned themselves.
 </p>
 <p>
  Obviously, that attack would be blocked, and he would be killed instantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the outcome was completely unexpected.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Eh… Huh?!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Sword King… allowed the attack?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Commentators voiced their surprise.
 </p>
 <p>
  The reason was that the hammer of light had struck the Sword King’s head.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  A loud noise resonated from the unarmed head of the Sword King, and from there, a trickle of blood flowed.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this game, it was the first significant damage the Korean national team inflicted on the Sword King.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the Sword King wiped the blood trickling down his forehead with his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, he smiled.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Well done.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sword King drew his twin swords and stabbed himself in the chest.
 </p>
 <p>
  [What in the…?!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [What on earth is happening?!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What… What’s happening?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why is he suddenly committing suicide?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The murmurs were loud, and not just from the commentators, but also from the people in the restaurant.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  Amidst the chaos, Mashid seemed deaf to those noises.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No way… how…”
 </p>
 <p>
  His gaze shifted from the TV screen to Seong Jihan’s smartphone.
 </p>
 <p>
  Specifically, at the bet Seong Jihan had placed on Korea winning the 1st game and Lee Jin-Wook being the MVP.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Although the Sword King committed suicide…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The kill would be credited to Lee Jin-Wook.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since the only damage dealt to the Sword King from the Korean team was the Support’s feeble attack.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, it was obvious even without watching the entire game that the system would credit Lee Jin-Wook for defeating Japan’s strongest warrior, making him the MVP.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How did you know… about the MVP?”
 </p>
 <p>
  To the obvious question, Seong Jihan nonchalantly replied,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I saw it in a dream.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s… impossible.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “My dreams are special.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It sounded absurd.
 </p>
 <p>
  Betting such a large amount on such an improbable outcome just because he saw it in a dream?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Does he have some special gift?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who had yet to reveal his status, made him wonder if he possessed a special ability.
 </p>
 <p>
  Given that he spoke of a dream, what could be done?
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no other way to find out.
 </p>
 <p>
  “And in that special ‘dream’… You appear too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I-I appear in it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. As the world’s best Mage.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Mashid’s eyes trembled.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who accurately predicted the seemingly impossible situation, was now confidently stating that Mashid would become the world’s best Mage.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even if you hadn’t made a contract with me, you would have eventually found a way to become a Mage.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But if you make a contract with me, you can walk that path much faster, can’t you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……Yes, you’re right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Mashid nodded his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once he found the way forward, he would have gathered money by any means and bought the Arachne Orb.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, it would have taken an incredibly long time.
 </p>
 <p>
  But if he gets help from Seong Jihan, he could skip a tremendous amount of that hellish time.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…And then,’
 </p>
 <p>
  Adding Seong Jihan’s astonishing predictive ability on top of that?
 </p>
 <p>
  Mashid could firmly make up his mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan, I will make a contract with you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “An excellent choice.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Diego Mashid, who had the potential to become the world’s greatest Mage, now had the opportunity to awaken his abilities faster by joining hands with Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The best outcome.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan wore a satisfied smile.
 </p>

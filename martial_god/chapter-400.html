 <p>
  Chapter 400
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s impossible. That can’t be!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The administrator message showed an intense reaction.
 </p>
 <p>
  [In the first place… Yes! If it was a fake code, isn’t it strange that you’re alive? If it was fake, there must have been a trap!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [There was a trap. As the World Tree burned, the world was covered in destruction codes.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [What… But you survived that?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yeah, Ashoka turned back time for me.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Using Yoon Seah’s ID, Seong Jihan roughly informed him of what had happened.
 </p>
 <p>
  […You’re not deceiving me, are you?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Instead of suspecting me, check the contract properly again, you stupid bastard.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [W-Wait! I’ll see.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Saying that, Gilgamesh fell into silence for a while.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, who had transmitted Seong Jihan’s words to her own phone, finally asked Seong Jihan,
 </p>
 <p>
  “What in the world happened?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I went through something quite big.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No… But it sounds ominous. Talking about World Tree, destruction, Martial God…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “As expected, Jihan… There was a reason you left during the match against China.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, that’s because they were too easy to beat.”
 </p>
 <p>
  They were now too mismatched to participate in the national team match, so he had only won up to the 2nd match and left.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, Sophia, who had been peeking at the messages on Yoon Seah’s phone, had her eyes sparkling.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jihan, did you find the World Tree? Is it related to that World Tree Alliance?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a bit difficult to explain the details.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… A hero’s secret… Is that it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If Uncle won’t tell us, it doesn’t seem like an ordinary serious problem, does it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought about the situation he was in now.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God in an infinite regression state.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was originally strong, and on top of that, he could tremendously amplify his power through the Constellations’ Artifacts scattered like stars in the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  In contrast, he was the strongest among humanity, but he couldn’t guarantee victory against the Abyss Owner in North Korean territory.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Taiji Sword had reached the level of drawing out a dagger, but the power gap was still like the difference between heaven and earth.
 </p>
 <p>
  No, it was more than that.
 </p>
 <p>
  And if he were defeated,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This world will be destroyed, and the Martial God will leisurely return to the past again…’
 </p>
 <p>
  This much wasn’t just an ordinarily serious problem,
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a problem on which the fate of humanity depends.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At those words, Yoon Seah, who was holding chopsticks, was startled and dropped her food.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ack! The scale is that big? The fate of humanity depends on that problem?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No… If Jihan fails to solve the problem he’s currently facing, will we all perish together?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Will we be demoted from the Bronze League or something?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even if that happens, we’ll perish, but we’ll also perish if we can’t solve this problem.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If the Martial God turns back time, everything will be reset from the beginning anyway.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s no different from all the people living in this current world disappearing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No… Then it’s not just a serious problem?? It’s not the time for an after-party?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right. It’s not time for a party, is it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jihan… Is there any way I can help?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the three of them were talking in a serious tone,
 </p>
 <p>
  Beep. Beep.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah~ Congratulations on the MVP~!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hello.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon and her bodyguard Lim Gayeong entered with a bunch of alcohol.
 </p>
 <p>
  The two, who had been smiling and trying to join the after-party celebrating the victory against China,
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What’s with this atmosphere?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Didn’t you win today?”
 </p>
 <p>
  They tilted their heads upon seeing the people looking at Seong Jihan with a serious atmosphere.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  “…No way, the fate of humanity depends on the boss? Is there such a serious problem? People say these days are the best time to live.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Humanity, which had greatly benefited from the effects of racial evolution after entering the BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  To the point where everyone said they could never go back to the past,
 </p>
 <p>
  The quality of life had greatly improved.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It is the golden age now! Although there’s the side effect of ears sticking out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah said that while touching her ears.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although there were quite a few people whose appearance had changed, such as ears or jaws sticking out like her,
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Even those people were mostly satisfied with their current evolved state compared to before evolution.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because the tangible effects were that significant in terms of living.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this era, which could be called the golden age of humanity from a third-party perspective,
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan, who had brought about this, mentioned fate, they couldn’t help but be surprised.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I mentioned it thoughtlessly and made the atmosphere serious again.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan smiled bitterly as everyone stared at him intently.
 </p>
 <p>
  Maybe he should have been more careful with his words.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But if I lose, everything ends anyway… There’s no need to hide it, right?’
 </p>
 <p>
  In order to face the powerful enemies ahead, he had to use all the power he could utilize.
 </p>
 <p>
  And among such powers, the most useful one was the star buff.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Then, whether fighting the Martial God or the Abyss Owner, I’ll have to reveal it publicly anyway…’
 </p>
 <p>
  If he was going to broadcast it all through Battle Tube anyway,
 </p>
 <p>
  It would be better to resolve their curiosity to some extent now.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was contemplating what to do,
 </p>
 <p>
  Buzz buzz buzz…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah’s phone vibrated.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Aaaargh! That damn snake bastard Martial God…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The message from Gilgamesh, the administrator of the half-elf community,
 </p>
 <p>
  Was filled with curses towards the snake.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I was deceived. I was deceived. The snake toyed with me…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [How were you deceived?]
 </p>
 <p>
  […I can’t reveal all of a father’s faults to his son.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned upon seeing the message.
 </p>
 <p>
  This guy, why is he talking about his son in this situation?
 </p>
 <p>
  [I don’t have a father like you, so cut the crap and speak quickly.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Absolutely, absolutely cannot say…! Aaaack…!! I was crazy…!! #$**#$# percent!#]
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh seemed to have had a mental breakdown over how he was scammed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Is this guy really that Constellation? The one who was boasting about being the King of Humans?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Maybe we’re being deceived by someone pretending to be Gilgamesh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  “It might really be an impersonation. There are so many weird people these days.”
 </p>
 <p>
  While the people looking at Yoon Seah’s phone were speculating if it was fake,
 </p>
 <p>
  […Son. It’s no use. Let’s fuse. That’s the only way we can oppose the Martial God.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you call me son one more time, I’ll kill you first.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Urk… This is too much out of the plan…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh seemed to be in a panic, talking nonsense.
 </p>
 <p>
  [At this rate, it’s destruction. Humanity will only become food for the snake…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Not only me, but my children and descendants will all enter his stomach!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [What should I do? What should I do to solve this…]
 </p>
 <p>
  He was boasting about being the King of Humans, but why is he so broken down now?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He’s so different from the two I saw in the sealed area.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak, who had sealed the Blood Race across the world and guarded the World Tree for hundreds of years to prevent ghosts from coming out,
 </p>
 <p>
  Or Ashoka, who ultimately stopped the Martial God’s plan to engulf the world in conflagration when things didn’t go well.
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to those two, Gilgamesh seemed to be getting lighter in weight the more he looked at him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan coldly looked at his messages lamenting his situation, and then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stop whining. How’s the situation in Tuseong?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Whining…How dare you!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Read the messages you sent later and judge for yourself.]
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s words, he seemed to be really reading the messages he had sent, as there was no reply for a while, and then,
 </p>
 <p>
  […Tuseong is no different. Even when I try to meet the awakened Ashoka, the Martial God is blocking contact.]
 </p>
 <p>
  He changed the topic to the Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  [What about Dongbang Sak?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [He’s the same as always.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Really?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan tilted his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since the seal was released, hadn’t he regained his memories?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Don’t tell me, I have to destroy the core to find them?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Why did he seal the memories in the deepest part?
 </p>
 <p>
  Even now, with the Martial God remaining beyond the Abyss Owner,
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak had to be either recruited as an ally or at least not made into an enemy.
 </p>
 <p>
  To do that, it was essential to make him regain his past memories.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hmm, the Martial God has summoned his disciples…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Occasionally, send me news about Tuseong like this. It’s even better if you send it directly to me as a Constellation message.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s difficult. The Martial God is quite wary of you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Me?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes… Sending messages through this community rather than through BattleNet will be less likely to be detected by him.]
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  [The half-elf community has better security than BattleNet?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Martial God doesn’t censor sites like this.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Then, are you saying the Martial God can censor BattleNet messages?]
 </p>
 <p>
  […I’m just being careful in case. I’ll send future news this way.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh then cut off contact.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Then, has the spy in Tuseong changed from Pythia to Gilgamesh?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan smiled and took his hands off Yoon Seah’s phone.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he wanted to receive news later, he shouldn’t keep contacting through this.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah. Can you tell me the ID of this site?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Should I log in on Uncle’s phone?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. The cautious owner of Tuseong wants it that way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Owner? He’s just a disciple, isn’t he?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Saying that, Yoon Seah set up auto-login for the half-elf community on Seong Jihan’s phone.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then she carefully asked him,
 </p>
 <p>
  “The story related to the fate of humanity… It’s still a secret, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not really. I’ll have to livestream it all on BattleTube later anyway.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “R-Really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, I have to reveal it to the world through BattleTube to receive buffs anyway. But,”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan then looked around.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll organize the story related to this and tell you.”DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jihan, if it’s a difficult story, you don’t have to tell us. I don’t want to burden you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No. You all should know why you’ll die if I’m defeated.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I-Is that so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Or would it be better to just die without knowing?”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s question,
 </p>
 <p>
  “…No.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We should know the reason.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Everyone shook their heads.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  The center of Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  There, where a huge divine throne was placed,
 </p>
 <p>
  The wandering Martial God was sitting and had summoned all his disciples.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The administrators’ interference is more persistent than I thought…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking around at his disciples, the Martial God opened his mouth,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Gilgamesh.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I already ordered Pythia. Follow her guidance and face the enemy.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Enemy… Who are you talking about?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You will face the underling of the White Administrator.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why should I do such a thing…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You haven’t forgotten our contract, have you?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Mentioning the fraudulent contract, Gilgamesh glared at the Martial God,
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  But he suppressed his anger and followed the Martial God’s order for now.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh disappeared through the portal Pythia opened.
 </p>
 <p>
  After watching the two disciples leave for a moment, the Martial God said,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dongbang Sak.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. My Lord.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Grant the Taiji to the Abyss Owner.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Abyss Owner…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ding.
 </p>
 <p>
  At Dongbang Sak’s question, the Martial God displayed North Korean territory.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing this, Dongbang Sak bowed his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood. I will go right away.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak’s form slowly disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon, the only remaining servant of the Martial God was Ashoka.
 </p>
 <p>
  […]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God silently looked down at him, and Ashoka stood with a smiling face.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You, prepare to turn the Golden Wheel as ordered.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I will do so.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Then, I’ll go again.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God’s form vanished, and
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…If Dongbang Sak grants the Taiji, this round will also be a failure.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Ashoka was judging the situation with cold eyes,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ashoka. Are you… still keeping the Forbidden Enlightenment?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The voice of Dongbang Sak, who had clearly disappeared, was heard by him.

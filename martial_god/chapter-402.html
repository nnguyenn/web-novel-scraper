  Chapter 402
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the Void Training Room.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stat “Red” increases by 1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan continued to absorb the “Red” stat from the Administrator’s hand, which was in the shape of an eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  The “Red” stat rose so easily that it felt like a waste to have invested so many residual points in it before.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It has already reached 100.’
 </p>
 <p>
  When “Red” reached 100, the flame power that had been perfectly controlled by Seong Jihan began to slowly slip away from his grasp.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stop making more now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Why don’t you absorb more?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can’t control it anymore.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have good instincts, as expected.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Administrator’s hand, which sent this message to Seong Jihan, obediently stopped creating new blood vessels.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ever since he was told to lay a golden egg, it had been cooperative.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite being the hand of the Absolute of the Universe, it obeyed Seong Jihan’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked down at the ground and spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You, you listen to my words very well, don’t you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I somehow feel like I have to.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, is that why you’re so obedient?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ah, there’s another reason too.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Another reason?
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Want to know if you can handle it?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just tell me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I’ll tell you when you reach 200 Red.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As it spoke, the red eye began creating new blood vessels again.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I told you I’m not going to absorb it right now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Are you scared? Then ask later.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the red eye of the Administrator’s hand provoked Seong Jihan subtly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching it try to provoke him again, Seong Jihan briskly floated the eye and tried to place it back into the black sealed box.
 </p>
 <p>
  [What, are you already going to seal me again? Just let me stay out for a bit longer.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A message hurriedly appeared over the eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It really doesn’t want to go back in, does it?’
 </p>
 <p>
  In any case, the conversation might be possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  Given the situation, Seong Jihan decided to ask about the “Red” stat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, how do you use the “Red” stat?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [?? You gathered so much but don’t know?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I know how to use it, but I want to understand it better.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The main body used “Red” mainly for writing code.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “A code like a destruction code?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Correct.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan remembered the types of codes he knew.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Destruction and domination were the most common. There were also seal codes.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The destruction code possessed by the Iron Blood Cross, and the seal code possessed by the Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods.
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering Gilgamesh’s Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit had a domination code, it was plausible there were two codes left.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Then what’s left is the Return of the Light and the Ice Sword Rain.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If the Ice Sword Rain is the exploration code, then what about the Return to Light?
 </p>
 <p>
  He knew it turned back time, but it’s hard to define what kind of code it is.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Destruction, sealing, domination codes—I understand those. What about the remaining two? Exploration?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do you think there are only 5 codes? The main body created thousands of codes.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Thousands?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Of course. While the Black and White constant Administrators were arrogantly slacking off, my main body was the only one working hard.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Jiing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Texts began to flood over the eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The green one was only focused on saving his treasure from the beginning, while only my main body was pitifully doing all the Administrator work……]
 </p>
 <p>
  “The green one was like that all along?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Green Administrator leading the World Tree Alliance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Was he already having ulterior motives while the red Administrator was active?
 </p>
 <p>
  [The main body worked so diligently hoping that the constant Administrators would acknowledge his efforts and make the red one a constant Administrator……]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re glorifying your main body too much. Still, the red one ran off with the Administrator seat.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [No! It was the main body that overhauled the BattleNet system and maintained it extensively. After working so hard, being asked to step down from the Administrator seat is unjust! They promised a permanent position upon finishing the work!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The hand of the Administrator refuted vehemently at Seong Jihan’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  From its standpoint, it felt like a temporary worker being promised a permanent position but then being discarded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, this view must be taken with the understanding that it was coming from the red Administrator’s perspective.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tell me, does it make sense to be asked to retire without any recognition? Being an Administrator means death upon retirement……]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that why you fled?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Correct. That’s why I ended up being cut off while on the run.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Explain in detail what happened then.”
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  [I don’t know the details either. I’m just the hand. How should a hand know everything?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ve been talking so far, but now you don’t know?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I really don’t. Truly.]
 </p>
 <p>
  For a hand that morphed into an eye and typed out messages, to now claim ignorance?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan gave it a cold stare.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you don’t know anything, just go back in.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He tried to place it back into the black storage.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Wait, wait! I know other things!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Like what?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [How to use Red. “Red” derived energy through special “combustion.”]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Combustion, huh…… if you burn it to obtain energy, that’s just thermal power generation?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Thermal power generation?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Creating electricity from fire.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The idea is similar, but Red combustion has a different energy exchange rate, and it doesn’t produce electricity.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then what does it produce?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It depends on the user.]
 </p>
 <p>
  When it came to significant issues, it spoke ambiguously again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned, repeatedly placing the eye in and out of the storage.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Properly explain the special combustion method.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Use the code “Sacred Flame.”]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sacred Flame……”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the text the red hand indicated, Seong Jihan’s eyes glowed.
 </p>
 <p>
  A code named after a holy flame.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Sophia received and then lost the Sacred Flame from Pythia…’
 </p>
 <p>
  After thoroughly reflecting on it multiple times, Seong Jihan had yet to definitively identify the white flame, the Sacred Flame.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not entirely convinced, Seong Jihan tried to write the code as the hand directed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  And then.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoomph……!
 </p>
 <p>
  A white flame ignited from his fingertip.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……What, this is really the Sacred Flame?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite various attempts, he couldn’t identify it before.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unexpectedly discovering it through the red hand made Seong Jihan feel baffled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you suggesting that gaining energy through combustion means acquiring buff effects through the Sacred Flame?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan asked this as he considered the buff effects gained through the Sacred Flame.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Buff? Who needs that?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The red hand refuted as if disregarding the notion.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Burn players with Sacred Flame to extract energy.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “……What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [By the way, Sacred Flame burns more intensely with life energy. It would be fun to burn the World Tree with Sacred Flame.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Burn the World Tree?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan remembered something upon hearing this.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Martial God intended to set the Earth ablaze and leave because of Dongbang Sak and Ashoka….’
 </p>
 <p>
  If planning to migrate elsewhere, they could just leave.
 </p>
 <p>
  Was the intent to burn the Earth with Sacred Flame to obtain energy?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should test if this works in BattleNet games.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan contemplated while observing the white flame idly.
 </p>
 <p>
  And thinking about it.
 </p>
 <p>
  The hand said the Sacred Flame burns more intensely with life energy.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s test it here in the training room.’
 </p>
 <p>
  No harm in starting a fire here.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan judged and initiated feeding the Sacred Flame with life energy.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he did so.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoomph……!
 </p>
 <p>
  The flame, gaining intensity, gradually turned red.
 </p>
 <p>
  [So much life energy being supplied……]
 </p>
 <p>
  While the red hand expressed surprise at the continuous supply of life energy.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sacred Flame that changed to red emanated one destruction code after another.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This looks similar to when I created a fake code in the Nine Palaces Eight Trigrams inner formation……’
 </p>
 <p>
  With this, could the Sacred Flame’s transformation into a world-engulfing blaze be imminent?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided this was enough and ceased supplying life energy.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why isn’t that going out?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Once ignited, the destruction code persisted.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You poured too much life energy, it’s settled now……]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really? What happens now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Combustion will start.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Whooosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Destruction code and red flame spread within the training room.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  The power of fire, shifted to a raging blaze from Sacred Flame, began expanding through the unmodeled void space of the training room.
 </p>
 <p>
  The dark space became engulfed in white flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, when will this go out….”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I don’t know. It’s too strong……]
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan and the red hand passively watched.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish……
 </p>
 <p>
  From the flaming part of the training room.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……What trouble have you stirred this time?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The owner of the Arena appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Near Pyongyang, inside the Abyss.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, you are the Master of this Abyss.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak stood before a violet giant with red eyes embedded throughout its body.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Abyss Owner made from fragments of the red ghosts, the legacy of the Blood Tribe.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having regained his memories, Dongbang Sak now roughly understood its true identity.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……Fragmented Red Ghosts, once sealed away, have conglomerated together.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He reiterated what he had speculated when his memories were sealed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Until the time came to defy the Martial God, he had to act thoroughly sealed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Twist. Twist.
 </p>
 <p>
  The red eyes embedded in the violet giant’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  Simultaneously focused on Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dong……Bang Sak……How did you……find this place……!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why, am I not supposed to be here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Not absorbed yet……already the end, it seems…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “That?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [……Whatever the case, I’ll kill you. You……die!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish……
 </p>
 <p>
  The eyes embedded in the Abyss Owner all began rotating.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each eye started to create a Taiji pattern.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mimicking the first stage of the Taiji Sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s crude.”
 </p>
 <p>
  While stroking his beard, Dongbang Sak coldly evaluated.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That is not how you utilize Taiji.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Shwoop!
 </p>
 <p>
  With a swift strike, Dongbang Sak tore through the giant’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Kr……Ugh……!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The eye’s movements depicting the Taiji stopped.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak’s figure vanished, then lightly stood on the giant’s head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Observe.”
 </p>
 <p>
  And from the top of the head, he lightly drew a Taiji pattern.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though smaller in size compared to what the Abyss Owner made.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This……This……]
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is the correct way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  That Taiji pattern persisted, revolving continuously atop the giant’s head.
 </p>
 <p>
  [What……are you scheming? Installing this……Are you seriously teaching me Taiji?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. It’s an order from the Master.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master……Did the Martial God really give such an order?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. He wishes for you to eliminate Seong Jihan thoroughly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  While surveying the Abyss Owner.
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed, a far stronger entity compared to others dispatched from the Abyss.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Only by overcoming this can Seong Jihan possibly conquer the Martial God….’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Ashoka mentioned, to defeat the Martial God, one must surpass the Abyss Owner’s level.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, do well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Shwoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  After leaving those words, Dongbang Sak’s figure disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  […….]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Abyss Owner remained focused on the revolving Taiji above its head.
 </p>
 <p>
  Time passed by unheeded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish……
 </p>
 <p>
  The red eyes embedded in the giant’s flesh began rotating again.
 </p>
 <p>
  The flow of Taiji slowly started resembling Dongbang Sak’s.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom! Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  The giant’s body began to explode from various sides.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Eliminate……Seong Jihan.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The massive head dropped to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  From within, a purple, void-drenched form of Seong Jihan appeared, pieced together from thousands of shattered parts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Peering at the continuously revolving Taiji, he twisted one side of his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……Do you think I will follow?”

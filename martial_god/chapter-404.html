  Chapter 404
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s eyes sank deeply.
 </p>
 <p>
  The entity before him, identical in appearance.
 </p>
 <p>
  He could immediately tell who it was, feeling the faint power of the void.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Taiji’s Lost Soul?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. I have something to discuss.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Taiji’s Lost Soul, who confirmed Seong Jihan’s question, sat down at the dining table with a familiar step.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But before that, shall we eat first? Let’s have a meal together.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He beckoned towards the dining chair, gesturing them to sit.
 </p>
 <p>
  As if this were his own home.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……Wow, is that a doppelgänger? What do we do, Uncle?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let him eat a meal before he dies.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, alright……”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Yoon Seah reluctantly placed the food on the table.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Go ahead.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Taiji’s Lost Soul picked up the chopsticks.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  Observing the opponent slowly savoring each bite.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan felt frustrated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Why is he eating so slowly?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah, did I eat that slowly?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No…… Uncle usually eats quickly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ignoring the comments, the Taiji’s Lost Soul savored each side dish.
 </p>
 <p>
  After taking a bite of all the side dishes, he finally looked at them.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aren’t you eating?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You… you’re not my uncle! How can you eat with us?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  At Yoon Seah’s words, the Lost Soul looked at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah, let’s eat together.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh……”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If it’s his last meal, we should let him have it properly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You don’t have to sit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pointing chopsticks at him, the Lost Soul said at Seong Jihan’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If Uncle doesn’t eat, I won’t sit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then sit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the Lost Soul put the chopsticks down again as Yoon Seah spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  Who was going to serve the last meal to himself, enough to be ground by the Taiji Sword in infinite regressions?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is getting tiresome.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Should he just flip the table and be done with it?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan pondered but.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Once we finish eating, call my sister.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sister? You mean Mom…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Alright. Let’s sit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At the Lost Soul mentioning his sister, he sat down.
 </p>
 <p>
  So began the awkward meal.
 </p>
 <p>
  The two Seong Jihans ate the food while.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh, what is this….”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah couldn’t focus on eating, worriedly looking back and forth between them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Maybe that’s why.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Lost Soul put his chopsticks down, her face brightened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You finished… didn’t you, Fake?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then I’ll clear the table!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Shwip. Shwip.
 </p>
 <p>
  She quickly removed the dishes from the table.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……She’s bright.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching Yoon Seah’s back as she busily cleared the table, the Lost Soul said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “She’ll live well if she moves to another planet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Move to another planet?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Indeed. In this world, my role. No, our role is to prepare for escape.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Escape, you say.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The undeniable fact of this world’s impending doom. Numerous deaths prove that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Taiji’s Lost Soul touched his face.
 </p>
 <p>
  From his face down his neck.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thousands upon thousands of shattered pieces of Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each one had been killed by the Taiji Sword in the infinite regressions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “And.”
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  Suuu.
 </p>
 <p>
  He turned his gaze towards Seong Jihan’s back.
 </p>
 <p>
  Where Yoon Seah, standing with astonished eyes, was.
 </p>
 <p>
  “In all these deaths, Yoon Seah has never survived even once.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Most times, she died before me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wh-what are you talking about? This fake…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing her confusion, Seong Jihan changed the subject.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How did you come out? Surely you were gathering strength to take over the body within the Taiji’s Lost Soul.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. It’s true that ‘Seong Jihan’ lacked the strength to dominate the Taiji’s Lost Soul. But.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Suuuu……
 </p>
 <p>
  A screen appeared before the Lost Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak was shown drawing Taiji on a giant’s head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is……”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Dongbang Sak granted Taiji to me to ensure your death… During the process of reconstituting the body, I seized control of the Lost Soul.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Dongbang Sak……”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This has never happened before. The Absolute, the Martial God, is wary of you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ziiiiing.
 </p>
 <p>
  The screen vanished.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a settled face, the Lost Soul continued speaking.
 </p>
 <p>
  “However, there’s no reason I have to follow the Martial God’s plans.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……What are you planning?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve gathered enough strength. Join me in escaping this world. With our family.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Escape…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your sister agreed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As he finished speaking.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swooooo……
 </p>
 <p>
  A purple portal appeared behind the Lost Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  And from within it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……Mom?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Appeared the petrified figure of Seong Jiah.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sis, is that true?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [……Yes.]
 </p>
 <p>
  In response to Seong Jihan’s question, petrified Seong Jiah nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do you remember? I said I would save you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You said you’d evacuate us to a planet with similar human species.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Right. This world is doomed. I wanted to save at least my daughter and brother. But… it wasn’t easy.]
 </p>
 <p>
  She then looked at the Lost Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Abyss Owner was restraining me.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “At that time, I hadn’t fully controlled this body, so I couldn’t communicate effectively. And the escape plan she attempted had already failed…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Suuuu……
 </p>
 <p>
  The screen displayed the scene.
 </p>
 <p>
  It showed Seong Jihan and Seong Jiah cramped in a refuge.
 </p>
 <p>
  The small sphere soaring towards the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed to be escaping Earth but exploded in the air just before leaving the atmosphere.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just before the explosion, Seong Jihan saw the Taiji pattern.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Taiji Sword had persistently driven him to death.
 </p>
 <p>
  “A total of seven times I’ve died like this. We needed a new way to escape.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What is it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Changing species and opening the Void Gate to escape.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Lost Soul twisted the corner of his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll warp to a place beyond the Taiji’s reach.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ve already found a candidate planet. A world of similar human species… There, people live are very much like humans.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That world has no BattleNet and is peaceful. Of course, there’s different races and beings like demon kings? But they’re so weak even Seah could catch them.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is this… another world?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Abandon Earth and escape to a new one?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Surprisingly, not a bad idea?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought initially.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the Taiji granted to the Lost Soul by Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed his memory hadn’t returned.
 </p>
 <p>
  So even if he defeated the Taiji’s Lost Soul, he’d have to fight Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then the Martial God awaited.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the Martial God had the power to control the Golden Wheel that could turn back time.
 </p>
 <p>
  If things didn’t go right and reset.
 </p>
 <p>
  Or if he lost to Dongbang Sak, everything would be over.

 <p>
  ‘Considering the Martial God’s nature, he’d probably start the next regression by killing me or heavily restricting me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  More fittingly comparable to a cautious snake than a Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if the situation was inevitable, it was clear he wouldn’t give Seong Jihan the same opportunities in the next regression.
 </p>
 <p>
  The fact that he possessed such strong power in this world truly made this the last one.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead of preparing for the unlikely.
 </p>
 <p>
  No, honestly improbable victory against the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  The escape plan presented by the Taiji’s Lost Soul was enticing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What about humanity? This world? If we escape, if Uncle disappears, can humanity overcome BattleNet?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah asked seriously but.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Family is more important than humanity.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s true.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The two Seong Jihans said in unison.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No…! What will I do if Uncle, too, says that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve seen you die countless times… I want to save you at least once.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Through his method, it’s promising. That’s why sister agreed, I suppose.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A fine answer… Will you join me then? If we act together, we can escape within a week.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Lost Soul extended his hand towards Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Saving family over humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  This proposition was undeniably attractive.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially to Seong Jihan, who knew how formidable his remaining adversaries were.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Yes, let’s accept.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather than challenging a highly improbable chance, focus on saving family.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking so, Seong Jihan reached out to clasp the hand, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  Stopped halfway.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hesitating?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Jihan….]
 </p>
 <p>
  “We are mere individuals. You don’t have to worry about the fate of this world. This is an unavoidable end. If so… shouldn’t you at least save your family?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Taiji’s Lost Soul persuaded Seong Jihan, who had paused mid-action.
 </p>
 <p>
  Their cooperation would make the escape much easier.
 </p>
 <p>
  Leaving a doomed world, starting anew in an isekai with human-like beings.
 </p>
 <p>
  It might weigh on his conscience.
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering that Seong Jihan held the only possible chance to stop the doom.
 </p>
 <p>
  But.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Haven’t I already failed countless times?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The proof of failure was the Lost Soul before his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though having uncovered the infinite regressions of the Martial God now.
 </p>
 <p>
  The conclusion was clear, the difference was monumental.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now was perhaps the optimal chance for escape.
 </p>
 <p>
  The cooperative stance of the Taiji’s Lost Soul should not be missed.
 </p>
 <p>
  But.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have a bad feeling.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Bad… feeling….”
 </p>
 <p>
  In the midst of the grave atmosphere.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah asked incredulously as Seong Jihan mentioned his bad feeling.
 </p>
 <p>
  He agreed with everything the mosaic Seong Jihan said, so why suddenly bring up a bad feeling?
 </p>
 <p>
  “…You doubt me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, I think you’re trustworthy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Lost Soul frowned, displeased at the ‘bad feeling’ comment, Seong Jihan shook his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  He genuinely believed in the proposal.
 </p>
 <p>
  Logically, he thought they should accept the offer.
 </p>
 <p>
  But.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If I go, it won’t work…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wh-what are you saying, Uncle! You have to come if we’re going!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah retorted, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Taiji’s Lost Soul stood silent, watching him.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve already attracted too much attention.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s……]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have the red Administrator’s hand. The Eye of Light is installed on my BattleTube. After escaping, is staying hidden really possible?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You can just hand it over to the Sun King or the Dragon Lord, who sponsored a lot! And stop watching BattleTube.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No.”
 </p>
 <p>
  To Yoon Seah’s retort, Seong Jihan, seemingly having organized his thoughts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Spoke with a clear expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It won’t play out that way. There’s already multiple Administrator powers intertwined; extricating myself alone from this chaos isn’t feasible.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So what… you’re staying behind… surely.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll stay. You’ll have to take responsibility and get everyone to safety.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “….You.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll eliminate the Martial God and call you back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan smirked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Take a temporary trip to another world.”

  Chapter 406
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon seeing Yggdrasil’s message offering experience points, Seong Jihan furrowed his brow.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Sure, I’m a bit desperate to level up, but this offer from Yggdrasil seems terribly cheap, doesn’t it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to previous offers, this time the only condition from Yggdrasil was experience points.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yggdrasil had sent the message, likely thinking that Seong Jihan, who had rejected previous proposals, would accept this one.
 </p>
 <p>
  -When did Yggdrasil start offering experience points?
 </p>
 <p>
  -This looks so lame, lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Previously, Yggdrasil offered to turn humanity into elves and remove the shackles of the race… This feels like a huge downgrade, haha.
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers also commented that the experience reward did not align with Yggdrasil’s stature.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yggdrasil, the World Tree, says he won’t ask for anything in return this time.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [He only requests that you participate in the upcoming Space League, in exchange for experience points.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just participate?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike before, this time Yggdrasil’s condition was almost non-existent.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who generally tried to participate in the Space League, even without any special demands, found it agreeable.
 </p>
 <p>
  Participation in the game with the World Tree Elves was something Seong Jihan was inclined to do anyway.
 </p>
 <p>
  “He’s offering experience points just for participation… How is he planning to deliver them?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yggdrasil, the World Tree, answers that you will find out upon participation.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Yggdrasil didn’t reveal how the experience points would be granted.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yggdrasil adds that he simply wishes to have an in-depth conversation through an avatar. The experience points are a reward for this.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan pondered the message for a moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Well, since I was planning to participate anyway.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He nodded slowly.
 </p>
 <p>
  -This sounds even more suspicious because he claims he needs nothing…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wouldn’t it be better if Seong Jihan doesn’t participate in the Space League?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Our current rank is among the top anyway, so losing one match to the elves shouldn’t be a big deal, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  -But if we dodge every match with the elves just because we’re scared, our human ranking will plummet, though, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  -True. Without Seong Jihan, no one can beat the World Tree Elves…
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan said he would participate, human viewers expressed their anxiety. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  But giving up on the match with the World Tree Elves wasn’t a realistic option either, as there were no alternatives for the representative team.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hidden Quest cleared.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The game is ending.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as the conversation with Yggdrasil ended, the game concluded simultaneously.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  Logging out, Seong Jihan contemplated in his room.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Yggdrasil… Is he trying to persuade me again with something that obviously won’t work?’
 </p>
 <p>
  While the specific content of what Yggdrasil wanted to discuss through the avatar was unknown, Seong Jihan reflected on past interactions that had ultimately resulted in gaining benefits, big and small, from dealing with World Tree Elves.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sssssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  Beyond Seong Jihan’s door, a black mist seeped through.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon, it coalesced into the shape of the Shadow Queen.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Long time no see. Have you gathered many sponsoring players?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm. Thanks to the freedom you granted, I’ve secured some decent players.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Shadow Queen, who was originally with Seong Jihan’s black sword, Eclipse, had left temporarily to recruit sponsoring players in earnest.
 </p>
 <p>
  While her absence had reduced the shadow energy contained within Eclipse, Seong Jihan had released her, considering there was plenty of void energy within the training grounds during his practice sessions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you finish your sponsoring duties already? That was quick.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, with the limited power I have, expanding my sponsoringing player base to this extent is the limit. It’ll take about 3 to 5 years to recoup what I’ve invested.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “3 to 5 years, huh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Humanity still has you, so the Space League should proceed smoothly. Retrieving the invested resources won’t take long.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon seeing her devising long-term plans to recover invested resources within 3 to 5 years and expand her sponsoring base, Seong Jihan realized something.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘She must not have been around when Ashoka turned back time and the infinite regressions of the Martial God were revealed…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Confirming the Shadow Queen hadn’t witnessed those events, Seong Jihan formulated a different perspective, seeing her optimism in long-term planning.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Why are you looking at me like that? It’s like you’re pitying me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not at all. You’re doing great. Humanity’s investment is worthwhile. After all, there’s me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, that’s true, but…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Shadow Queen, slightly dubious, got down to the business that had brought her to the room.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can I join you when you meet Yggdrasil’s avatar?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why? Do you plan to attack the avatar?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No. Attacking an avatar is meaningless. I’m just curious about how Yggdrasil operates the avatar.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sure, come along.”
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan extended his left hand, the Shadow Queen’s form turned back into a black mist, being absorbed into his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The void within the sword has deepened. Did something happen?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I destroyed the void training room while practicing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The void training room…? Huh. When you become a constellation, you’ll soon threaten the great constellations]
 </p>
 <p>
  Great constellations, huh.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I wonder if that day will ever come.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With a bitter smile, Seong Jihan checked the date for the next Space League match.
 </p>
 <p>
  The game with “World Tree Elves – 55” was now only three days away.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Three days later, the Space League match commenced.
 </p>
 <p>
  =In this Space League match, the opponent is none other than World Tree Elves – 55!
 </p>
 <p>
  =They are currently the top-ranked team in our Bronze League.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Weren’t World Tree Elves – 200 ranked first last time? Geez… The top spot always seems to go to World Tree Elves every time!
 </p>
 <p>
  Even after humanity defeated one group of World Tree Elves and took the top spot, another World Tree Elf team would claim the vacant top position.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why are elves always number one every single time?–;
 </p>
 <p>
  -Didn’t we briefly hit number one ourselves last time?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yeah, but their daily point gain is so high that we can’t keep up…
 </p>
 <p>
  -If Seong Jihan wins this time, they’ll be knocked down again.
 </p>
 <p>
  -And then another hidden second-place team will take the top spot and be revealed as World Tree Elves anyway.
 </p>
 <p>
  -They’re seriously unshakeable, LOL.
 </p>
 <p>
  As it became clear that another World Tree Elf team topped the ranks, viewers reacted with a mix of annoyance and resignation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Summoned to the representative team’s waiting room, Seong Jihan met Sophia.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jihan!”
 </p>
 <p>
  She approached, concerned.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s going on with Seah lately?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “When I asked her why she wasn’t streaming on BattleTube, she was sighing heavily the whole time, and she doesn’t look okay.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Following her gaze, he saw Yoon Seah sitting alone, looking dejected.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan approached her.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Still looking glum?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…And whose fault do you think that is?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Think of it as a trip.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What kind of trip is that…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing her mood worsen at the mention of the trip, Seong Jihan patted her shoulder.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s okay. I’ll finish everything and call you back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Then shouldn’t I stay here too if you’re going to finish everything?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Clearly, she was determined not to survive alone.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan realized he needed to frame the evacuation differently to ensure Yoon Seah’s compliance.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not about living alone. If you’re taken hostage, my actions will be restricted. This is to prevent that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh. Then what about the others?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The others…”
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  In response to her question, Seong Jihan’s eyes turned icy.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even if they become hostages, I won’t be restricted.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “R-right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, so for the sake of completing things properly, you need to ‘travel’ for a while.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Deep in thought, she mumbled.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Maybe that’s enough for today.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Deciding not to press further, Seong Jihan prepared to force her compliance if necessary.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ziiing.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Summoning the coaches of both teams.]
 </p>
 <p>
  With the message, the scene in the waiting room’ screen showed the coach’s office.
 </p>
 <p>
  Coach Davis, with a tense face from facing the top-ranking team, and.
 </p>
 <p>
  “….”
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking rather downcast, the High Elf Priestess.
 </p>
 <p>
  [TL/N: made a mistake in old chapters called her priest instead of priestess]
 </p>
 <p>
  The same face as other World Tree Elf representatives, yet she seemed gloomier than her counterparts.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Place the ban and select cards on the table.]
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  “Here they are.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon the system prompt, Coach Davis quickly presented both ban and select cards.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The high priestess only submitted a select card, which piqued Davis’ interest.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Not banning Seong Jihan, huh.’
 </p>
 <p>
  World Tree Elves had tried many tactics but always ended up handing victory to humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing no ban card, Coach Davis speculated they might finally be going the straightforward route.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No matter their reasons, this works for us.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Smiling confidently, Davis watched.
 </p>
 <p>
  The result appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘World Tree Elves – 55’ has their top three players banned from matches.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Players ranked 1, 4, and 6 are banned from the first match.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Getting the 1st ranked opponent banned was a good result.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Their number one player is banned!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Excellent start for Coach Davis.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Although it’s curious they didn’t provide a ban card though!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Could it be due to an agreement between Seong Jihan and Yggdrasil, thus no ban card?
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah… If that’s the case, Seong Jihan will definitely play! This boosts our chances!
 </p>
 <p>
  The commentary team, pleased by the start, was puzzled by the chosen map.
 </p>
 <p>
  =The selected map is… Ah, it’s chosen by the elves!
 </p>
 <p>
  =The first match will be held on the ‘Skyforest’ map!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Why does the map name have to involve a forest, of all things!
 </p>
 <p>
  Skyforest.
 </p>
 <p>
  What treachery could they have lurking there?
 </p>
 <p>
  Coach Davis worried upon seeing the map name, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The high priestess let out a regretful sigh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike previous counterparts who hid their emotions, the high priestess of World Tree Elves – 55 seemed more sorrowful than the opposing Coach about the Skyforest map.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…This is the end for us.”
 </p>
 <p>
  End? They chose the map themselves.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unable to verbalize his confusion, Coach Davis frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright… Best of luck to your number one player, enjoy the experience.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Mentioning experience, she glared back.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Could it be… Does the Skyforest map relate to Yggdrasil?’
 </p>
 <p>
  With that uncertainty, the first match on Skyforest began.
 </p>
 <p>
  =As the name suggests, it’s a forest in the sky!
 </p>
 <p>
  =The clouds seem to support the trees.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Players have no issues standing on the clouds.
 </p>
 <p>
  =It’s beautiful, but given the opponent, we have to be cautious of their tricks.
 </p>
 <p>
  Skyforest was indeed a giant forest in the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ooh, it looks like clouds but feels solid.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No need for flight magic, it seems.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s prepare just in case they’re hiding something.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Players discussed strategies while.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll scout ahead.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan stepped into the Skyforest.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Employing his light-foot technique soon sensed the elves’ presence.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They’re gathered there.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Landed in front of the congregated elves.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before long, the elves lowered their weapons.
 </p>
 <p>
  A green-haired elf walked forward with a wide smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Distinct entirely green hair shimmered with massive life energy, catching Seong Jihan’s attention until he realized–
 </p>
 <p>
  “Before we talk, first.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With an unchanging smile, the elf motioned backward.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pointing a finger at the kneeling elves.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Have some experience points first.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [PR/N: I don’t like Yggdrasil, bad move sacrificing own.]

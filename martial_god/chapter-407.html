  Chapter 407
 </p>
 <p>
  “The elves, as experience points?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The green-haired elf smiled brightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kill as many as you want. I’ll keep resurrecting them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Resurrection… Was that possible? Here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Since I’ve descended through an avatar, it’s possible in this Sky Forest map.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Are you Yggdrasil?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yggdrasil twirled her hair with her fingers.
 </p>
 <p>
  [PR/N: Just so it’s not confusing, the avatar is a girl.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I had to make quite a lot of sacrifices to incarnate in this fragile elf body.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sacrifices…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I used up almost all the life force of the World Tree installed in the 55th colony. Isn’t it great for humanity? One of the top-ranking teams will fall.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The ranking will fall?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Because the World Tree will wither.”
 </p>
 <p>
  So that’s why the elf proxy had such a gloomy face in the coach’s room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at her with darkened eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What are you scheming?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh my. This time it’s truly out of good will?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hah. You’re giving up the World Tree for my level up?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “For me, World Trees and colonies are abundant. Even if I give up one, it’s a negligible loss in my world.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Yggdrasil gestured behind her,
 </p>
 <p>
  Crunch! Crunch!
 </p>
 <p>
  The sound of elves’ bodies being shattered from the inside could be heard.
 </p>
 <p>
  And not long after,
 </p>
 <p>
  Poof!
 </p>
 <p>
  From within, violently squirming hearts popped out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  Yggdrasil floated those dripping bloody organs and neatly lined them up in front of Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Here, I specially made them easy to kill. If you swing your sword once, the hearts will burst.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Weren’t elves beings that regenerate even without hearts?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right. But if I say they should die, they must die.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yggdrasil raised the corners of her mouth and brought her finger to one of the hearts.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  Pop!
 </p>
 <p>
  The organ burst like a balloon.
 </p>
 <p>
  As blood splattered from it, Yggdrasil’s face was dyed red.
 </p>
 <p>
  And at the same time,
 </p>
 <p>
  Shhhh…
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the elves behind her suddenly turned to dust and vanished.
 </p>
 <p>
  “See. They die just by touching like this. Isn’t it convenient?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…There’s no need to go out of your way to make it easy to kill them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Since I’ve incarnated like this, you should level up sufficiently. You should kill at least 10,000, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “10,000?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Hmm… Is 10,000 too few? If we push it, I think 100,000 is possible.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Smiling brightly, Yggdrasil kept urging to execute the elves, saying she’ll keep resurrecting them.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Look at that twisted personality lol
 </p>
 <p>
  – Deserves to be called the elf boss…
 </p>
 <p>
  – The elves were annoying, but this is unpleasant to watch
 </p>
 <p>
  – No, don’t you remember they tried to execute us? Sympathy for elves is a luxury.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Yeah, and if one World Tree Elf falls, isn’t it a huge benefit for us? Lol
 </p>
 <p>
  – But can we trust what that Yggdrasil is saying…
 </p>
 <p>
  While the viewers were arguing whether it was good or not to accept that proposal,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Going that far, what do you want to tell me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Going that far… This? This is just an experience point gift.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yggdrasil counter-questioned Seong Jihan as if she found it strange.
 </p>
 <p>
  She seemed to have no understanding of what was wrong with the act of ripping out elf hearts and giving them.
 </p>
 <p>
  From her perspective, was it not a big deal for them to die like that?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, as the leader of the World Tree Elves, this much wouldn’t be significant…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought so and looked at the pulsating hearts in front of him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s one week until going to the abyss now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Elf hearts that looked like they would burst with a single touch.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bursting 10,000 of these was an extremely easy task for Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘At the current leveling speed, I definitely won’t reach 500 by the promised time, so destroying these would be the easier path.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Bursting elf hearts and killing 10,000.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t a burdensome task for Seong Jihan.
 </p>

 <p>
  Because of them, didn’t humanity get pushed to last place in the league and eventually get demoted in the previous life?
 </p>
 <p>
  If he continuously burst the hearts as Yggdrasil offered,
 </p>
 <p>
  He could easily raise his experience points and reach the target level 500 and beyond.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can’t trust the good will of the elves.’
 </p>
 <p>
  They say not to view the other party with colored glasses no matter who you interact with,
 </p>
 <p>
  But when dealing with the World Tree Elves, you definitely had to start with suspicion.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s see.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan brought a squirming heart closer.
 </p>
 <p>
  The life force felt was very faint.
 </p>
 <p>
  If this was burst, would the life force of the main body disappear and the elf die?
 </p>
 <p>
  But for that, the force was too weak.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Should I try tracking it?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan amplified his senses and closely examined the life force contained in the heart.
 </p>
 <p>
  His domain expanded in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  The life force in the heart was stretching out very faintly towards Yggdrasil.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan felt this and looked at her,
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re not going to burst that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yggdrasil asked with a smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was taught to first suspect the good will of elves.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… You’re well-informed despite not having entered BattleNet for long.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She’s not denying that statement either.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the domain of Martial Soul reached Yggdrasil,
 </p>
 <p>
  She twirled her hair.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, you’ve passed the first stage.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “First stage?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. The test of ‘not gobbling up whatever others give you’.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Slurp.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yggdrasil licked the blood on her face and continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now, investigate and see. What’s strange.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re not denying that you tampered with the hearts.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “When you clearly know, is there a need to deny it? You expanded your domain like that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She figured out the Martial Soul Domain right away.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan continued tracking the life force for now.
 </p>
 <p>
  The life force stretching towards Yggdrasil completely disappeared by the time it reached her.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is it because the force is too weak?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the heart and tried inserting a bit of his own life force into it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, the life force of the heart became clearly distinct.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike before, the force didn’t disappear as soon as it reached Yggdrasil.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was advancing towards a definite target.
 </p>
 <p>
  That was none other than,
 </p>
 <p>
  The green hair possessed by Yggdrasil’s avatar.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  “It was connected to this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  The green hair caught in the Martial Soul Domain.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Hehe.”
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Yggdrasil only watched this with a smiling face.
 </p>
 <p>
  And,
 </p>
 <p>
  Snap!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the hair was severed,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh my…! You precisely figured out which hair and where it was?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yggdrasil let out a delighted exclamation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll give you the reward for the second stage.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Shwoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The body of Yggdrasil, who said she would give a reward, began to shrink rapidly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pop! Pop!
 </p>
 <p>
  At the same time, hearts burst in all directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  And elves turned to dust and disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  The trees in the Sky Forest also withered rapidly and twisted.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The opposing team has been annihilated.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The 1st match will end soon.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A message appeared saying the game would end soon.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  – ?? What?
 </p>
 <p>
  – The game ends when you cut her hair?
 </p>
 <p>
  – So anticlimactic;;;(
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

 </div>
 <p>
  The reaction of the viewers watching the 1st match was the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  What is this?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan and Yggdrasil confronted each other, exchanged a few words,
 </p>
 <p>
  Then as soon as part of Yggdrasil’s hair was cut, her body suddenly shrank and the game ended.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the games Seong Jihan had finished so far, it wasn’t like there hadn’t been ones that ended quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  But they had never seen a game end so absurdly like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  – But why isn’t it ending?
 </p>
 <p>
  – It said it would end soon earlier.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Shouldn’t it end right away when the opposing team is annihilated??
 </p>
 <p>
  – I know…
 </p>
 <p>
  – The game progress is really strange ㅡㅡ
 </p>
 <p>
  – Is it because Yggdrasil descended… Is she up to some nonsense?
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though the opponents were annihilated, the word ‘soon’ was attached,
 </p>
 <p>
  And seeing the game not ending, the viewers felt uneasy.
 </p>
 <p>
  And,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…This was her aim from the beginning.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, the directly involved party who faced Yggdrasil, was experiencing firsthand why the word ‘soon’ was attached to the game ending.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Following the route I searched the life force, Yggdrasil’s power is coming in.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stat ‘Eternity’ increases by 5.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The life force possessed by the green-haired elf.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was entering Seong Jihan’s Eternity through the path he figured out.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stat ‘Eternity’ increases by 5.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Eternity, which was really hard to raise, had already increased by 10.
 </p>
 <p>
  While it was good that the ability increased,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hello?]
 </p>
 <p>
  From the World Tree contained within Seong Jihan,
 </p>
 <p>
  [I’m happy to become one.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Yggdrasil’s voice could be heard.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Was this your purpose?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [No. I really came to talk. Since I can’t openly talk to you who has the Eye Of Light installed. I have to enter inside.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you want to talk about that you’re doing this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Wow, this World Tree. It grew really well? Looks delicious. Seong Jihan. Why don’t you really become one with me instead of this? You raised the tree so well?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Yggdrasil prattled on cheerfully inside Eternity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned deeply upon hearing those words.
 </p>
 <p>
  When did she enter like a parasite and now she’s saying let’s become one.
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you just hand over the control of Eternity, I’ll get to work right away. The gardener of Yggdrasil. How about it? Isn’t it cool?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that your main point? I’ll kick you out right now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Geez… Why are you rejecting so much? I’m saying I’ll make you the Administrator’s companion.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Even after trying to entice Seong Jihan several times,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Eh. You won’t come over yet… I got it. I’ll bring up the main point. Don’t you want to stop the Red Administrator?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Go ahead, tell me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Is this her main point?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan said that out loud for now,
 </p>
 <p>
  But inside, he was looking for a way to clean up the foreign substance that entered his internal Eternity.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Should I burn it with Sacred Flame?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sacred Flame he had been refraining from using openly since BattleTube was on.
 </p>
 <p>
  But burning my own body wouldn’t be caught by others.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Now just send your thoughts to Eternity. The White one might hear.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Got it. So, what’s the way to stop the Administrator?’
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan was stalling for time and trying to drive Yggdrasil out from inside,
 </p>
 <p>
  [You seem to really intend to stop him?]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If you’re going to play with words, I’ll burn you right now. Get to the main point.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ah~ okay. Your fire is threatening. I’ll bring up the agenda right away.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Yggdrasil said she would get to the main point, but started with the introduction again.
 </p>
 <p>
  [But before that, first. Don’t you want to know who the ‘Red Administrator’ is?]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Red Administrator… I suspect it’s the Martial God.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Martial God… He is, of course, one of the Red candidates. However. This time, as humanity evolved, I abducted, confined, and experimented on them, and reached a new conclusion.]
 </p>
 <p>
  When did this bastard abduct people?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned and asked,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So what’s the conclusion?’
 </p>
 <p>
  [Humanity! The human race itself was the Red Administrator!]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…What nonsense is that?’
 </p>
 <p>
  He was wondering what she was going to say, but it’s absurd.
 </p>
 <p>
  Humanity is the Red Administrator?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If we were such a great race, why are we the lowest grade?’
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s certain.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What’s the basis for your conviction?’
 </p>
 <p>
  [I helped with this before. The Red Administrator.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…What?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Yggdrasil revealed to Seong Jihan in a cheerful voice that she was an accomplice.

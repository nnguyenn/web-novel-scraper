  Chapter 409
 </p>
 <p>
  – A win by default?
 </p>
 <p>
  – What is this;
 </p>
 <p>
  – We’re seeing all sorts of things in the first year of the Space League opening lol
 </p>
 <p>
  World Tree Elf 55, who was ranked 1st in the Bronze League.
 </p>
 <p>
  With Seong Jihan, they thought they would win, but a fierce battle was expected depending on the presence or absence of bans.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Yggdrasil’s avatar descended during the 1st match and the opposing species disappeared after that, the viewers were bewildered.
 </p>
 <p>
  And,
 </p>
 <p>
  = Ah… It says all opposing players have been annihilated!
 </p>
 <p>
  = Is it because of Yggdrasil who descended on the opposing team earlier? The power of World Tree Elf 55 suddenly disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  = If this happens… Will they be able to recover in the future league progression?
 </p>
 <p>
  = I don’t know. I can’t say for sure how it will turn out, but it will be difficult for them to recover for a while, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  As it was displayed that all players of World Tree Elf 55 were annihilated, humanity was forcibly given the victory.
 </p>
 <p>
  The commentators were dumbfounded by the current situation, but they were predicting what would happen in the future.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Is this the price of the Green Administrator descending??
 </p>
 <p>
  – I thought it was nothing because she was only talking nonsense in the chat, but the opposing species went extinct just from briefly showing herself lol
 </p>
 <p>
  – Really… But did she really just level him up after coming? I couldn’t see much conversation.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Yeah, even watching Seong Jihan’s channel, there wasn’t much talk.
 </p>
 <p>
  – The game did end a bit later than usual. She must have done something while disappearing?
 </p>
 <p>
  In the chat, they thought Yggdrasil, who was always proposing and getting criticized, wasn’t that great of a being.
 </p>
 <p>
  But seeing the aftermath of the Administrator descending, people realized how high Yggdrasil’s status was.
 </p>
 <p>
  And,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They ended up ruined…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing that all the players belonging to World Tree Elf 55 disappeared, Seong Jihan thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But even though I killed the Administrator’s avatar that caused such a result, it’s not considered an amazing achievement?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Probably because it was close to Yggdrasil letting herself be killed.
 </p>
 <p>
  That ‘amazing achievement’ didn’t even budge.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Then what do I have to clear?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The amazing achievement required to become a Temporary Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  But there was no detailed information about the conditions for that.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I don’t think defeating a Constellation will be enough…’
 </p>
 <p>
  If a Constellation isn’t enough, the next is a Great Constellation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Is it telling him to defeat a Great Constellation with this body before becoming a Constellation?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, I need to show at least that much for them to propose the position of Administrator, even if temporary…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Administrator position at the very top of the BattleNet pyramid.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how temporary, to jump there at once would require that much achievement.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was deep in thought while watching the Space League match that ended in an instant up to the 3rd match.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jihan, aren’t you going?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, yeah, We should go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin approached and spoke to Seong Jihan, who was like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The match ended easily today.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yggdrasil’s descent must have been that much of a blow to the World Tree Elves.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If they maintain that state, World Tree Elf 55 will definitely be last place in the league.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We still need to prepare in case they revive as if nothing happened.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right. Anyway, they’re a species backed by an Administrator.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin, who was exchanging words with Seong Jihan like that,
 </p>
 <p>
  Glanced around and lowered his voice to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “By the way, Jihan. Seah’s behavior has been strange these days… Do you know anything?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah was like that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, she keeps hesitating to tell me something…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan fell into thought for a moment while looking at Yoon Sejin, who was stroking his chin as if troubled.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It would be good to send brother-in-law to the other world too if possible.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Although his sister Seong Jiah said Yoon Seah could subjugate the Demon King even if she went to the other world,
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s when her power is maintained.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once they actually escape there, it was unknown what would happen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, the Lost Soul will go together.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed better for safety if Yoon Sejin escaped too.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Did they say it’s not possible because he’s human?’
 </p>
 <p>
  They said you have to change species to move, and you need to show evolution like Yoon Seah’s protruding ears to change species.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll tell you about Seah’s issue when we get home. But brother-in-law, do you have any changes from species evolution? Like Seah’s protruding ears.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Me? Well. I don’t feel anything except being healthier.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin, who couldn’t find any notable changes even after evolving when asked just in case.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">

 <p>
  Then he’s disqualified from the conditions for escaping to the other world from here.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…I feel like that’s because of the Lost Soul’s influence.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He said you can’t be human to cross the void gate.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking coldly, even Seong Jihan evolved but didn’t his human body not change?
 </p>
 <p>
  Since they initially decided to escape together, wouldn’t he be disqualified too with that condition?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Saying brother-in-law can’t go may be because of the accumulated ill feelings.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Taiji’s Lost Soul, who only has memories of being betrayed by Yoon Sejin, may be like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even Seong Jihan gnashed his teeth at Yoon Sejin just with memories from the previous life.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Taiji’s Lost Soul must have an enormous overlap of such memories.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if the current Yoon Sejin repents and devotes himself to Yoon Seah, it won’t be able to acknowledge him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to clearly check if it’s really not possible before escaping.’
 </p>
 <p>
  And before that,
 </p>
 <p>
  He would need to explain the situation to some extent to Yoon Sejin.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shall we go home and talk for now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay. Seah said she’s having dinner with the archer players. Let’s go first.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Let’s do that.”
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  “…This is my sister and the Lost Soul’s plan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I see. Escape…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin, who heard Seong Jihan’s explanation after returning home, fell into deep thought.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  “What does Jihan think? Does that seem safe?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m not certain, but it’ll be better than here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Is it that dangerous here? Rather, the current situation seems better than the BattleNet tutorial period.”
 </p>
 <p>
  During the tutorial period, many people died or lost their homes due to dungeon portal monsters.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather, these days after entering the main game, they’re recovering the taken land by eliminating dungeon portals.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ranking within the league has also risen, so dungeons themselves are being generated less.
 </p>
 <p>
  On top of that, humanity even experienced evolution, so it was a situation that could be called the golden age.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin couldn’t understand why they were taking refuge during this golden time.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even if it’s peaceful now, a dangerous moment will come. We just need to take refuge for a bit then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I see. Jihan’s words must be right. Jihan has never been wrong.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What about brother-in-law coming together?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Me too?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin, who was pondering deeply at Seong Jihan’s words,
 </p>
 <p>
  “What did Jiah say?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “She said you can’t go because there was no change during species evolution, but I’m going to try persuading her.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Looks like she said not to take me for now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He smiled bitterly at Seong Jihan’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I did do a lot of terrible things… Of course, even if it was because of brainwashing, the wrongs I committed in the past haven’t disappeared.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Besides, I’ve already disappointed many people.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin approached the window and looked at the night view.
 </p>
 <p>
  The splendid scenery of downtown Gangnam could be seen directly.
 </p>
 <p>
  He took in the sparkling city with his eyes and continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  “When the expectations for me were high in the motherland, I crossed the sea and went to Japan. I still feel guilty about the disappointment and despair I gave people then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “In the Sword King Family, unfortunately, there were several people who committed suicide…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sword King Family, the fan club of the Sword King.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now they’re pushed down by Seong Jihan’s popularity, but there was a time when it was said that if you’re Korean, you naturally had to join the Sword King Family.
 </p>
 <p>
  But when he suddenly went to Japan and spewed extreme remarks,
 </p>
 <p>
  There were many people who couldn’t overcome the shock of their idol’s betrayal and made extreme choices.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have no shame to escape to another world too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. If Jiah and Jihan go together, there’s no need for me to follow, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded, seeing Yoon Sejin’s will was firm.
 </p>
 <p>
  Personally, he wanted Yoon Sejin to go with Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  But with his own will like that, it couldn’t be helped.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment,
 </p>
 <p>
  Beep. Beep beep.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sound of the front door opening was heard.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, whose face was bright red, entered the house.

 <p>
  “Uncle!!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you drink?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehe. I’m an adult too, so what!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah. How much did you even drink… It’s not easy for a player to get drunk.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s why the unnies only gave me strong alcohol!”
 </p>
 <p>
  She ran to Seong Jihan,
 </p>
 <p>
  Looked at him with hazy, loose eyes, and hugged him tightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I, I. I made up my mind! I won’t go!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s the point of me running away alone! To live with aliens in another world? I won’t go. I won’t go!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, who buried her face in Seong Jihan’s arms,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looked around, found Yoon Sejin, and grinned.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Heh, Dad was here too?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was here the whole time… You only saw Uncle?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, that’s not it…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Yoon Sejin said that, feeling left out seeing Yoon Seah running to her uncle before her dad,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, who separated from Seong Jihan, hugged Yoon Sejin this time.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I won’t leave Dad and Uncle and go to another world!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…How much did they make you drink? I need to have a word with Yeonjoo.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes! How can I leave Yeonjoo unnie, the leader of our team, and go!”
 </p>
 <p>
  When the name of Ha Yeonjoo, the leader of the Archer Squad, came up, Yoon Seah rambled even more about not going.
 </p>
 <p>
  She kept saying she won’t go for a long time like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, as if coming to her senses,
 </p>
 <p>
  She looked at Seong Jihan with a startled face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, Uncle… This. Was I not supposed to say this? To Dad?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I already did. He said he’s not going either.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really? As expected of Dad! I’ll! I’ll stay too!”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Yoon Sejin said he knew, Yoon Seah was relieved and shouted several times that she would never take refuge.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Persuasion seems impossible.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Until now, she seemed to keep worrying, but after getting drunk, Yoon Seah revealed her true feelings like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  She seemed firm about not wanting to flee to another world.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then well.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Words won’t persuade her.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought so and smiled brightly on the outside.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay. I got it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You got it? Then I don’t have to go?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. How can I forcibly send you to another world when you say you won’t go?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really? Really? I really don’t have to go?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, really. I’ll tell my sister and the Lost Soul separately.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan said that, relief spread across Yoon Seah’s face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Whew… Telling me to run away alone is stressful… How can I leave my family and friends and go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I told you to think of it as a trip.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What trip! I clearly know you’re making me take refuge…! Anyway, you’re really not sending me? Really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes yes. I won’t send you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Phew…”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s confirmation, Yoon Seah let out a sigh of relief.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since she received such confirmation from her uncle,
 </p>
 <p>
  Now the escape to another world would become a nonissue.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m sleepy now that I’m relieved… I’ll go to sleep…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay. Go in and rest.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as Seong Jihan finished speaking, Yoon Seah went to wash up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin glanced at Seong Jihan while looking at his daughter like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Do you really not intend to send her?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who knows.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan just smiled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Doesn’t seem like you have such intentions.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin let out a small sigh, seeing that expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  And time passed, on the promised day with Taiji’s Lost Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You came.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, open the gate. Let’s start.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan arrived at the abyss.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  With Yoon Seah, who fell asleep with pressure points struck, in tow.

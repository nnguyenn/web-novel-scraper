  Chapter 411
 </p>
 <p>
  The experience of fighting the owner of the abyss, counting the one during the humanity annihilation scenario, was the third time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Back then, the giant was overwhelmingly strong, but Seong Jihan had also developed considerably compared to that time.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  [I won’t drag this out for long.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The opponent wasn’t passive like back then either.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hiss…
 </p>
 <p>
  The void energy thickly settled, and the space began to distort.
 </p>
 <p>
  That distortion that had completely erased humanity during the annihilation scenario,
 </p>
 <p>
  Was absorbing Seong Jihan more precisely than before.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He’s trying to absorb me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps because Dongbang Sak had bestowed Taiji, while previously the giant had the momentum to grind away Seong Jihan’s body,
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, the Lost Soul was trying to absorb Jihan into himself by sucking him into the distortion.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan already had a countermeasure for this attack.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fundamental Divine Arts,
 </p>
 <p>
  Annihilation God’s Secret
 </p>
 <p>
  Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods.
 </p>
 <p>
  The patterns of Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods began to spread around the sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  It blocked Seong Jihan’s front like a huge shield, completely blocking the fiercely unleashed attacks.
 </p>
 <p>
  [How annoying.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  As a red light flickered from the thousands of eyes embedded in the giant’s body,
 </p>
 <p>
  Chiiiing…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The patterns of Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods were cut horizontally and vertically, and the center was pierced through a single point.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is… Triad of Martial Mastery, isn’t it? You unleashed them simultaneously.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Total Annihilation., Mount Tai Suppression, and even Way of Immortals.
 </p>
 <p>
  Taiji’s Lost Soul was simultaneously unleashing the basic techniques of Triad of Martial Mastery using the void.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I’ve also inherited Nameless Divine Art.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nameless Divine Art It’s been a while since I heard that name. None of you could reveal the name?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You, you’re saying you figured it out?]
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s words, the Lost Soul’s offense momentarily stopped.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods quickly regenerated back to its original state.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I know.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [What is it? The real name of Nameless Divine Art. It was one of the things I was curious about before dying each time.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not difficult to tell you the name, but I’d like you to resolve my curiosity too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [What do you want to know?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “The method to restore Sister to her original state. If I win and you disappear, will it automatically be released?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sister couldn’t be left in that petrified state like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since it was the owner of the abyss who didn’t release her, Seong Jihan thought he also had a way to undo that state.
 </p>
 <p>
  And,
 </p>
 <p>
  […]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Taiji’s Lost Soul, who momentarily hesitated at Seong Jihan’s words,
 </p>
 <p>
  [To restore your sister to her original state, a key is needed. This one.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Pop!
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the eyes embedded in the giant’s chest burst, and a purple key took its place.
 </p>
 <p>
  Is that the key to unlock the shackles that were binding the petrified body?
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you defeat me, you can obtain it.]Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really? Then we can immediately settle this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [However, if that happens, your sister will be demoted from a constellation to a diamond supporter. Until we settle in another world, we need the power she holds as the Witch of the Void.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Another world is already a lost cause anyway? Then I need to find Sister’s human body.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That judgment is the decisive difference between you and me.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Lost Soul, who thought if he joined forces with Seong Jihan, they could escape to another world,
 </p>
 <p>
  And Seong Jihan, who was certain this matter was now impossible.
 </p>
 <p>
  The two didn’t emotionally antagonize each other, but their stances were very clear.
 </p>
 <p>
  [So, what’s the name of the martial art?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Will the name of Nameless Divine Art being revealed make his martial arts stronger too?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan momentarily thought about just extracting information and not teaching him,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Forget it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The other him had even displayed the key, so he didn’t want to lie about such a thing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s Fundamental Divine Arts.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Fundamental… Was that the name?]
 </p>
 <p>
  As if his question was resolved, the Lost Soul accelerated his offense.
 </p>
 <p>
  Chiiiing!
 </p>
 <p>
  The cracks gradually grew larger on Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods, which acted as a shield.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s body also slowly tried to enter the distortion of space.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I don’t mobilize all means, I’ll end up being absorbed…’
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how much Seong Jihan had grown, the difference in power he held with the Lost Soul was considerable.
 </p>
 <p>
  If his goal now wasn’t to absorb Seong Jihan but to annihilate him,
 </p>
 <p>
  He would have definitely taken damage from an even more intense wave of attacks.
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  ‘I need to deal a blow when he tries to absorb me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  For that, he would have to go all-out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan turned on BattleTube.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  – Oh, is the Challenger League game starting?
 </p>
 <p>
  – This is the first time, right? Haha
 </p>
 <p>
  – Huh? But… This doesn’t seem like an in-game?
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers who excitedly came in thinking Seong Jihan, who had risen to the Challenger League, was finally executing a game,
 </p>
 <p>
  – …Didn’t we see that giant somewhere before?
 </p>
 <p>
  – T-That’s the giant from the humanity annihilation scenario!
 </p>
 <p>
  – It seems a bit smaller in size compared to then…
 </p>
 <p>
  – But it looks exactly the same?? ㅡㅡ
 </p>
 <p>
  – The space is also distorting strangely like back then.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan’s opponent truly revealed his appearance, the atmosphere instantly turned serious.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because the owner of the Pyongyang Abyss, who brought about the end even though humanity won the Bronze League demotion match, was showing his immense presence on the screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  And,
 </p>
 <p>
  – Oh… I’ve seen this before.
 </p>
 <p>
  – He’s already clashing with that monster?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Seeing it move, it’s not just blankly standing there like last time… This, the outcome will be quickly decided.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ah, this is bad… I was going to bet on the human race, but what if they go extinct like this?
 </p>
 <p>
  As alien viewers also flocked in large numbers upon seeing the broadcast ON state,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Star Buff is activated.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A powerful buff that increases all abilities by 100% was activated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods, which was being cut helplessly a moment ago, quickly recovered.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the distortion of space could no longer expand and was yielding its territory to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  And,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  [You, don’t tell me you turned on BattleTube…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. I need to get some ability buffs.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […How disappointing.]
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan turning on BattleTube, the Lost Soul, who had been fighting but not antagonistic until now,
 </p>
 <p>
  For the first time, showed killing intent towards him from all his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You should know that if you livestream our battle through BattleTube, it will disrupt future plans.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The future plans the Lost Soul spoke of were of course,
 </p>
 <p>
  After absorbing Seong Jihan, using that power to take Yoon Seah and Seong Jiah and escape.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, if this battle was livestreamed through BattleTube, it might hinder this matter.
 </p>
 <p>
  But that was just their circumstance.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So you want me to give up the buff?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan had no intention of giving up the 100% amplification effect on his stats.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the first place,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Escape has become impossible.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As humanity was suspected to be the Red Administrator,
 </p>
 <p>
  And the void side also seemed to have figured this out and was imposing restrictions to prevent escape,
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if Seong Jihan obediently merged with the Lost Soul and tried to flee to another world, it would be difficult to shake off their pursuit.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If there was a possibility of escape, I might have joined forces… But now that it’s fallen through, I need to take control of the situation. Here, I have to subdue the Lost Soul even if I have to mobilize all my power.’
 </p>
 <p>
  And for that, the star buff was essential, so he had to turn on BattleTube no matter what.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  […Buff. Hah, in the end, even with your feeling or whatever.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Lost Soul, upon hearing Seong Jihan’s words, was greatly disappointed in him and,
 </p>
 <p>
  [You endured just to save yourself?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Furthermore, he showed intense killing intent.
 </p>
 <p>
  […Before things go wrong, let me make it so you can’t broadcast anymore.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Hiss…
 </p>
 <p>
  The distortion of space accelerated even more.
 </p>
 <p>
  The interior of the abyss space began to fold as if crumpling paper.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Die for now. I’ll absorb you after that.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Chiiing…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Lost Soul began to truly pressure him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan faced him like that and silently put on a half-mask.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, the void amplified.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Absorbing, you’re not the only one who can do it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Recalling the Sacred Flame, he advanced first towards the Taiji’s Lost Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  1 hour since BattleTube was turned on.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wow… Is this the real situation?
 </p>
 <p>
  – I think this is the first time I’m seeing Seong Jihan’s body explode like that…
 </p>
 <p>
  – The giant’s regenerative power is no joke either.
 </p>
 <p>
  The clash between the red-eyed giant and Seong Jihan had focused the attention of all humanity, even though only 1 hour had passed since the broadcast began.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, Seong Jihan’s broadcast usually had the highest viewership, but
 </p>
 <p>
  His current battle was drawing in far more viewers than usual.
 </p>
 <p>
  That was natural.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

 </div>
 <p>
  – If Seong Jihan loses here, is it humanity’s annihilation? Lol
 </p>
 <p>
  – No way… ㅡㅡ
 </p>
 <p>
  – Is this something to dismiss as ‘no way’? Lol This might be our last BattleTube broadcast…
 </p>
 <p>
  Because Seong Jihan’s opponent was the owner of the abyss, who was notorious as the boss of the humanity annihilation scenario,
 </p>
 <p>
  People couldn’t help but worry about the current situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a red light flashed from the giant’s eyeballs,
 </p>
 <p>
  Chiiing…!
 </p>
 <p>
  When an intense laser spewed out from there,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s arm seemed to endure it for a moment, then was cut off.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ah! S-Seong Jihan’s arm flew off again!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Phew, but it regenerates quickly…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Haa, that giant is fighting desperately unlike last time…
 </p>
 <p>
  A battle where they repeatedly exploded, regenerated, and exploded again countless times.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, because the difference in body size was so large, even if several parts of the giant burst, it wasn’t very noticeable when regenerated,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whereas if one part of Seong Jihan’s body exploded, it was very conspicuous.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kaboom!
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It exploded again.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked down at his right leg that had burst from the opponent’s explosion attack.
 </p>
 <p>
  The leg that had disappeared to the point where its shape couldn’t even be known.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  As the World Tree inside him, filled with Eternity, was activated, the disappeared body quickly regenerated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps because the ability of Eternity had improved in the meantime,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan had gained tremendous regenerative power to the point where if it disappeared, it would almost simultaneously return to its original state.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Taiji’s Lost Soul looked at this and spoke as if fed up.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You… Your regenerative power is too great, even if it’s great. Don’t tell me you converted to an elf? Going over to Yggdrasil?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Going over, my foot. I just gained their abilities, that’s all.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […Hmph.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re one to talk.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pop! Pop!
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan’s sword drew a single trajectory, the giant’s eyes and body simultaneously exploded.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, from the giant’s body that disappeared like that,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  A spiritual body came out and enveloped the disappeared parts, soon restoring the body.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your regenerative power is terrible too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. Your attacks are useless.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the intact giant and recalled the previous memory.
 </p>
 <p>
  Back then, the system said the weakness of the owner of the abyss was the head.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I aimed there countless times, but it was useless.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike the passive owner of the abyss in the mission,
 </p>
 <p>
  The giant possessed by the other Seong Jihan never allowed attacks on the head.
 </p>
 <p>
  1 hour passed with them only inflicting minor bleeding on each other, unable to deal a decisive blow.
 </p>
 <p>
  – This will be tough.
 </p>
 <p>
  – He, who even took over the Administrator’s hand, can’t defeat a single owner of the abyss?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Gosh… BattleNet is something you know but don’t know.
 </p>
 <p>
  – *&amp;*$SPACEBET134413*&amp;*$ is currently conducting private betting. Hurry and come in to bet on who will be the winner of this battle~~~!!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wow… A private betting company is dealing with it? This channel owner?
 </p>
 <p>
  – I’m betting on Seong Jihan. This guy always delivers.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Where are your eyes? Of course you should bet on the giant;
 </p>
 <p>
  – Can’t you tell just by looking?
 </p>
 <p>
  The aliens had already judged that the odds of winning were leaning towards the Taiji’s Lost Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the Taiji’s Lost Soul himself,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Was calming down the fiercely raised momentum.
 </p>
 <p>
  [At this rate, there will be no end. Until that is brought out.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you mean that…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Taiji Sword.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The giant’s eyes all rotated, drawing the Taiji.
 </p>
 <p>
  [However, if I bring this out, everything will collapse… Even you, whom I’m trying to absorb, won’t leave a trace.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Probably.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […Do you really want to see such an end? If the Taiji Sword is activated, no matter who wins, we will ultimately be the losers.]
 </p>
 <p>
  From the opponent’s perspective, if he brings out the Taiji Sword, the spoils of war disappear.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the end, it’s a situation where he only uses power and gains nothing.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan blankly stared at the Lost Soul, he continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  [What is your plan?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why, are you going to cooperate?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Depending on the situation. If I activate the Taiji Sword once, everything will be destroyed. Rather than both of us dying, it’s better for one to take it…]
 </p>
 <p>
  In the end, rather than engaging in a battle where both lose, is he saying he’ll listen to Seong Jihan’s plan?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s definitely me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan thought so and tried to have a conversation instead of maintaining the current confrontation,
 </p>
 <p>
  […No, wait.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Whirring…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Taiji being drawn in the giant’s eyes gradually began to grow larger.

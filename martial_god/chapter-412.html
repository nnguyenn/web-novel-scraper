  Chapter 412
 </p>
 <p>
  The Star of the Martial God, Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  [It has begun.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Martial God, who had somewhat sorted out the administrator’s interference and returned to Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dongbang Sak, you did well.]
 </p>
 <p>
  He said with satisfaction while looking at Dongbang Sak, who was kneeling before him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I merely carried out your orders.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The timing of Taiji’s activation was very appropriate… This time, you shall be rewarded.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak’s Taiji.
 </p>
 <p>
  The power he had implanted in the owner of the abyss was not simply to allow Taiji’s Lost Soul to take over the giant’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was more like a trap designed to activate at a crucial moment, using the giant’s body as fuel.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This time, you can make considerable progress…]
 </p>
 <p>
  When Martial God, who thought Seong Jihan was already finished upon seeing Taiji, was feeling satisfied.
 </p>
 <p>
  Step. Step.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you call for me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka politely walked to where Martial God was.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Then Dongbang Sak, you may withdraw and rest.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Martial God, who gave Dongbang Sak the order to leave as Ashoka arrived.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swooosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  As Dongbang Sak’s form was completely engulfed in darkness and disappeared, he slowly began to speak.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Now, when Seong Jihan disappears into Taiji, I will ignite the Sacred Flame on that land.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you planning to send Pythia?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. She will become the Sacred Flame and gather strength. Once that is done.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  In the darkness, two red lights flickered intensely.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Immediately activate the Golden Wheel. We must return before the administrator’s surveillance intensifies.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I will do so.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After eliminating Seong Jihan, he intends to return immediately.
 </p>
 <p>
  As expected of Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  Safety first.
 </p>
 <p>
  [From the next cycle, we must start by eliminating Seong Jihan first.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Furthermore.
 </p>
 <p>
  At his words that from now on, he will start by removing the variable called Seong Jihan itself.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka felt suffocated.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Seong Jihan was the only one who created variables in this infinite regression… If he disappears, will the next turn even come?’
 </p>
 <p>
  In a world that had been endlessly repeating, the only one who had brought the situation this far was the current Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  If such an existence disappears from now on, will humanity have no choice but to continue being sacrificed until Martial God rises as the ‘permanent administrator’?
 </p>
 <p>
  As Ashoka was inwardly lamenting like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  [And…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Martial God, who was looking at the screen, said quietly.
 </p>
 <p>
  [If, by any chance, though it’s unlikely, he survives Taiji. Immediately activate the Golden Wheel.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re not planning to retrieve the power of the Lowest?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. Even if I lose power, I will avoid this cycle.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “If Seong Jihan manages to win, the value of the power he holds will be immense…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Eliminating the possibility of my defeat comes first.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Defeat.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the numerous relics rising in Tuseong’s sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the power contained within them, he spoke of ‘defeat’ while looking at Seong Jihan, who hasn’t even become a constellation.
 </p>
 <p>
  A snake that is so cautious to the point of looking like a coward, unworthy of the name Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But… that makes it even more tricky.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If Seong Jihan wins, it’s a regression. If he loses, it’s also a regression.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka bowed his head to Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I will follow your orders.”
 </p>
 <p>
  This.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps the hidden dagger will have to be drawn out earlier than expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Unless there’s a special variable.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Then his eyes soon captured the screen Martial God was looking at.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Weren’t we supposed to hear the plan?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned as he looked at the Taiji spinning around in the giant’s thousands of eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a state of confrontation where they couldn’t break through each other’s regeneration.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was the one who first suggested talking instead of settling it with the Taiji Sword, so why is he doing this?
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Kuk… This power, I can’t control it…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The opponent was even more flustered than Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You can’t control it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes…! Somehow, Dongbang Sak didn’t simply grant Taiji. Still, I thought this power was perfectly under my control…]
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Ssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps the Lost Soul is desperately trying to suppress Taiji, the void is fiercely spewing out.
 </p>
 <p>
  And that attempt was partially successful, with Taiji disappearing and red eyes being revealed in some of the thousands of eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  One.
 </p>
 <p>
  Wiiiing…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Taiji he failed to control in time was gradually growing larger as they clustered together.
 </p>
 <p>
  It began to devour the body with eyes embedded in it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…At this rate, it will self-destruct.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The giant being consumed by its own Taiji.
 </p>
 <p>
  If such a situation unfolded in a BattleNet game, he would have kept his distance and waited for the opponent to die on their own.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But it doesn’t seem like it will die alone, that’s the problem.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan examined the abyss.
 </p>
 <p>
  This space, which had remained intact even after Seong Jihan and the Lost Soul’s bloody battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since Taiji appeared, it was rapidly collapsing.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the purple haze disappeared like that, what could be seen above was the blue sky of the real world.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ground on which Seong Jihan and the Lost Soul stood was rapidly rising, filling the cracks.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh… The cracks are being filled…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Wh-What, the abyss space itself is collapsing… This kind of thing…]
 </p>
 <p>
  And as they came out, the voices of Yoon Seah and Seong Jiah could be heard.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan quickly headed towards where the sound was heard.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some distance away from the cracks of the abyss, Yoon Seah and Seong Jiah were looking this way with surprised eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sister, go home with Seah as soon as possible.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […Okay, Jihan.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What about uncle?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have to take care of that guy first.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…It looks somewhat dangerous, wouldn’t it be better for uncle to avoid it for now too?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If we leave that alone, it will easily devour the entire Korean Peninsula?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Th-The Korean Peninsula?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, so get out of here for now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan gestured for them to leave quickly, Seong Jiah wrapped Yoon Seah around her waist and flew away at a tremendous speed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed, a constellation.
 </p>
 <p>
  She’s fast as expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile.
 </p>
 <p>
  – What??
 </p>
 <p>
  – The Korean Peninsula?
 </p>
 <p>
  – No… Isn’t that too big of a scale?
 </p>
 <p>
  – No, if you think about it, it’s the power that annihilated humanity… That thing…
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers watching Seong Jihan’s BattleTube were startled by the story that Taiji would devour the entire Korean Peninsula.
 </p>
 <p>
  They just turned on BattleTube as usual because Seong Jihan was broadcasting.
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, this might become their last broadcast in life?
 </p>
 <p>
  – I thought the Earth would be fine since they were fighting in that dark space, but suddenly it became our problem, wtf??
 </p>
 <p>
  – I’m in Seoul, can I survive if I go to Busan? Hahaha;
 </p>
 <p>
  – We’ll probably get sucked in before that -_-
 </p>
 <p>
  As human viewers fell into a panic like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  […I thought I had made the Taiji implanted in me my own, but it wasn’t at all. It was nothing more than a time bomb that could be triggered at any time…]
 </p>
 <p>
  The voice of the Lost Soul, exhausted by Taiji, flowed out.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Seong Jihan. At this rate, this body will merely become an energy source for the Taiji Sword…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems so.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan replied like that while looking at Taiji, which had already taken over more than 70 percent of the giant’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even the red eyes that he had barely managed to restore were spinning around again.
 </p>
 <p>
  At this rate, it seemed like this guy would also become the Taiji Sword itself.
 </p>
 <p>
  […We must prevent that from happening.]nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
 </p>
 <p>
  “How do we prevent it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Should I summon the Taiji Sword to block Taiji?
 </p>
 <p>
  However, looking at the opponent’s Taiji, Seong Jihan judged that it would be like a joint self-destruction.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The two Taiji Swords will resonate with each other and sweep away not just the Korean Peninsula but an even larger area…’
 </p>
 <p>
  If it was inside BattleNet or within the abyss space, he would at least try summoning the Taiji Sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  But in the real world, if something goes wrong, countless victims could emerge, so it had to be considered as a last resort.
 </p>
 <p>
  But if not the Taiji Sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  “At the moment, no way to prevent it comes to mind… Unless you willingly die by my hands.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That would be the case.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  […I was wrong. I thought I had sufficiently taken control of Taiji, but I wasn’t. At this rate, even if I escaped from here, I would have collapsed on my own along the way.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoooosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The earth split and the atmosphere distorted.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sky and the earth were slowly being sucked into the Taiji inside the giant’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  The giant’s flesh was collapsed even faster.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your sense… was correct. Indeed, the ‘me’ who always makes the optimal choice.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You believe it now?”
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  [Yes. How is it now? Does that sense still tell you not to merge with me?]
 </p>
 <p>
  When they devised the escape plan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who did not enter the giant’s body but chose to fight because of his ‘sense’.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Lost Soul asked him how that sharp sense of his was now.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the giant’s flesh collapsing into Taiji.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike an hour ago when they could have stably merged.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a precarious situation where if he tried to devour it, he himself would likely be caught up in Taiji.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Now, it’s telling me to take it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s sense was greedily telling him to devour it.
 </p>
 <p>
  As if reassured by those words.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Good. Take it.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The giant’s flesh crumbled and the wooden head fell in front of Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Break the head and dominate the Lost Soul there.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The weakness of the owner of the abyss, the head.
 </p>
 <p>
  He voluntarily gave it to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he broke this, will the Lost Soul be annihilated?
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [What are you doing? Quickly, break it. You… need to bring the key to your sister, don’t you?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s gaze turned to what used to be the giant.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although he was being consumed by Taiji.
 </p>
 <p>
  Only a small part of his chest was desperately trying not to let the eyes spin.
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside it was the key to Seong Jiah, which he had made into a ‘spoil’.
 </p>
 <p>
  The key to returning from the statue state to the original form.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even while his whole body was being consumed by Taiji.
 </p>
 <p>
  Was he enduring it somehow to protect that?
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Yes. Hold on a bit longer. I will put an end to it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan approached the giant’s head that had fallen to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  The head, which seemed like it would be sucked into Taiji at any moment, was larger than Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll write the annihilation code here and.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Chiiiik!
 </p>
 <p>
  The destruction code drawn on the wood.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then the giant’s head split open weakly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside it, a red sphere enveloped in the void was revealed.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan brought his hand closer.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoooosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The sphere instantly burned his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stat ‘Red’ increases by 1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stat ‘Red’ disappears by 1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, as the stat Red went up and down, it showed a fluctuating appearance.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘To perfectly control this, I need more Red.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking at his burning hand, Seong Jihan instinctively realized.
 </p>
 <p>
  The red sphere in front of him was the core of the owner of the abyss.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he completely dominates this, he can minimize the giant’s Taiji.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…But I lack the ability to do so.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Although he had grown a lot.
 </p>
 <p>
  To perfectly control this, more power was needed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Still, even with the current stats, I can partially manipulate it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  To the extent that Seong Jihan judged it possible was about 30 percent.
 </p>
 <p>
  But even with this level of control, which is not even half, if utilized well, the damage caused by Taiji can be minimized.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s fortunate at times like this that North Korea has been devastated.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can you make Sister’s key again? With my current abilities, it’s not easy to even block Taiji.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […It probably won’t be easy. Because it was a constraint made with the body of the owner of the abyss.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  If that guy said it’s not easy, it’s really difficult.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  To block Taiji and secure the key.
 </p>
 <p>
  Currently, the only way was to completely dominate the red sphere.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Constellation ‘Witch of the Void’ sponsored 10.21 million GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [I like it now, so don’t worry about it and break it with the key intact!]
 </p>
 <p>
  As if she had heard the conversation between Seong Jihan and the Lost Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jiah sent a sponsorship through BattleTube.
 </p>
 <p>
  A message saying not to worry about herself.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You like being in a statue state with the lock on?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan smiled at the sight of that.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You know I don’t really like to listen to you, Sister?”
 </p>
 <p>
  With the current abilities, he had no choice but to choose one or the other.
 </p>
 <p>
  But if he pushed himself a little.
 </p>
 <p>
  He could choose both options.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Inventory.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan took out the black seal box containing the red administrator’s hand.

  Chapter 413
 </p>
 <p>
  [What’s going on? Oh, this place is…]
 </p>
 <p>
  The red eyes that came out of the black seal box immediately displayed text.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This place… is the world of the main body?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The administrator’s hand, already convinced that Seong Jihan is the main body.
 </p>
 <p>
  He smiled bitterly and answered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re still saying that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I’m certain. The main body is the main body. But.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  The administrator’s hand looked at the red sphere Seong Jihan was trying to deal with.
 </p>
 <p>
  [What is that?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a troublesome thing that will devour this world.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You need power?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You know well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan stared at the red eyes while holding them.
 </p>
 <p>
  To free his Sister and block Taiji.
 </p>
 <p>
  He needed to gain the power of stat Red here.
 </p>
 <p>
  A lot, in a very short time.
 </p>
 <p>
  To do that.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll have to absorb this.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Previously, he didn’t think of absorbing it for fear of being completely swayed by the power of Red.
 </p>
 <p>
  But now it’s different.
 </p>
 <p>
  To obtain both, not just one or the other.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s okay to take some risks.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan thought so, a message popped up in his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, there.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Main body… You’re not going to eat me, are you?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The main body still lacks the power to fully dominate me. You may be caught up in the power of Red.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then wouldn’t that be good for you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s not good.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The red eyes that previously wanted to be absorbed by him were rather dissuading him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Because the grand plan the main body originally thought of may collapse. Even if I take over the main body, it won’t help the plan.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Still, I need power, and I have to absorb you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The two whose positions have completely changed compared to before.
 </p>
 <p>
  The administrator’s hand, perhaps reading Seong Jihan’s firm will, offered a compromise.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hmm. Then… Just implant me in the main body’s flesh.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Implant?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The eyes grew rapidly.
 </p>
 <p>
  It transformed into a human arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  At first glance, it was an arm the same size as Seong Jihan’s.
 </p>
 <p>
  But on the back of that hand, there were red eyes and reddish energy swirling on the skin.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Cut off your right arm and attach this.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re really cooperative. Suspiciously so.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I can also dominate the main body if eaten… However, I am certain that is not the best. Because the main body is the main body. The main body must remain as the main body, if I become the main, the grand plan will be distorted.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “For the first time, I feel like I’m benefiting from that main body talk.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan smiled as he looked at the administrator’s hand babbling about the main body.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack!
 </p>
 <p>
  He immediately ripped off his right arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Oh, uh…
 </p>
 <p>
  – No, what is Seong Jihan doing?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Don’t tell me. He’s going to attach that arm?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Isn’t that the administrator’s arm? If he attaches something like that, it seems like something bad will happen -_-;;
 </p>
 <p>
  – No, why is he doing such a dangerous thing…
 </p>
 <p>
  – To block that Taiji??
 </p>
 <p>
  – Then we don’t have to evacuate?
 </p>
 <p>
  At first, human viewers were startled to see Seong Jihan’s actions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Poof.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he implanted the administrator’s hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  And it fused as if it was nothing.
 </p>
 <p>
  – ??
 </p>
 <p>
  – What. It attached so easily?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wasn’t that the administrator’s arm…
 </p>
 <p>
  – It can be implanted like that without any problems?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Does that make sense? What the hell is this human Seong Jihan…
 </p>
 <p>
  – No, he may already be under control.
 </p>
 <p>
  – If he was under control, his body should change like the Red tribe, but it’s the same?
 </p>
 <p>
  Alien viewers were rather in an uproar.
 </p>
 <p>
  The red administrator’s arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite implanting such a tremendous thing, how is the human body still being maintained?
 </p>
 <p>
  They couldn’t understand.
 </p>
 <p>
  And.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Red Administrator’s Arm’ is implanted.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stat ‘Red’ increases by 300.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Crazy.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In front of Seong Jihan’s eyes, a stat increase he had never seen before in his life appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  300 increased at once.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he had known this guy would cooperate like this, he should have implanted it long ago.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No.’
 </p>
 <p>
  For that, the risk posed by the red administrator’s hand was not insignificant.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  If it wasn’t an emergency like now, he wouldn’t have done this no matter how much it raised his abilities.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even now, it’s only cooperative on the outside.
 </p>
 <p>
  Its inner thoughts are still unknown.
 </p>
 <p>
  But now.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Are you okay? Even with your current abilities, it will be difficult to dominate.]
 </p>
 <p>
  On top of Seong Jihan’s right hand, it was kindly sending worried messages.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s no abnormality at all?”
 </p>
 <p>
  And Seong Jihan, who pulled out his original arm and implanted the red one.
 </p>
 <p>
  He felt strange seeing his body adapting so quickly despite the new foreign substance entering.
 </p>
 <p>
  At this rate, it really seems like he’s the main body.
 </p>
 <p>
  And.
 </p>
 <p>
  [As expected, main body. You are the main body. I’m certain, certain, and certain again.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The administrator’s hand emphasized several times that Seong Jihan was the main body while looking at him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Stop saying that. I’m going to handle some work.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Understood. I’ll also look around a bit since I’m out in the world.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Ziiing…
 </p>
 <p>
  The text [Gathering Information] appeared in the eyes on the back of the hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  After that, the administrator’s hand no longer displayed any text.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Then I should do my part.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan brought his right arm to the red sphere.
 </p>
 <p>

  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  10 minutes later.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The Taiji that was ominously spreading in the giant’s body gradually ceased.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ooh…
 </p>
 <p>
  – It seems to be working?
 </p>
 <p>
  – That damn Taiji is disappearing…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Is it working because he implanted the hand?
 </p>
 <p>
  – I hope there are no side effects on Seong Jihan…
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the Taiji that appeared in the humanity annihilation scenario disappear, people were relieved, but they were also worried about what impact the administrator’s hand would have on Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…It’s too smooth.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was smoothly utilizing the stat that increased by +300.
 </p>
 <p>
  To the point where he thought he might actually be the red administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘In the first place, Yggdrasil said that humanity is the red administrator, but even within that, there can be differences in talent…’
 </p>
 <p>
  While having doubts about himself like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  For now, Seong Jihan was gathering the manifested Taiji one by one.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, perhaps because he was reversing the already spinning Taiji.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  A massive amount of void spewed out from the giant’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  Most of it was sucked into the half-mask Seong Jihan was wearing.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Something is colliding inside.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It didn’t seem to be absorbed obediently, as there seemed to be a rather intense collision inside the mask.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It can’t be helped even if it breaks. I can’t leave Taiji alone.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Since he acquired it from the High Elf, he had been using it really well.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought so and accelerated the control of the sphere.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack…!
 </p>
 <p>
  By the time the half-mask was completely cracked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Phew…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Taiji disappeared, and instead, the giant’s hollowed-out body was revealed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Taiji’s Lost Soul, whose flesh had already mostly disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  The remaining part was where the Lost Soul had desperately protected.
 </p>
 <p>
  Only where the key was.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Step. Step.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing this, Seong Jihan walked there.
 </p>
 <p>
  There.
 </p>
 <p>
  With half of his face shattered.
 </p>
 <p>
  And only his left arm remaining among his limbs.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Lost Soul was lying there, tightly holding the key in his left hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You… protected it until now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Because it was the only thing I could do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Lost Soul, who handed over the key with his crumbling arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  He smiled bitterly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I didn’t expect you to choose both Taiji and the key…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If I have the ability, there’s no need to choose only one.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Instead, you’ll be in danger.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was in danger normally anyway. I just added one more burden on my back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who referred to implanting the administrator’s hand as simply a burden.
 </p>
 <p>
  He clenched and unclenched his reddish hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “And so far, that burden has been very cooperative.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Lost Soul, who was visibly relieved when Seong Jihan received the key.
 </p>
 <p>
  He turned his gaze to Seong Jihan’s mask.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then… will you take on one more burden?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Will it be helpful? Like this arm.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It will be helpful. Although the risk is high.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then as much as you want.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Implant the core into that mask. Using the Sacred Flame.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Into this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Tap. Tap.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan tapped the half-mask he was wearing.
 </p>
 <p>
  The void processor that was already cracked enough to shatter at any moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the core is implanted here, won’t it explode properly?
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If that is the void processor of the green administrator… Our core is the way the red processes the void.”
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  “The way the red processes the void was that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right. The void is like… cancer cells to the administrators. It required proper processing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then the void processors of red and green are combining.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Correct. The side effects are unpredictable, but…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Crumble…
 </p>
 <p>
  The Lost Soul’s face was slowly turning to dust.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You will be able to gain power.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then I have to do it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I knew you would answer like that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Half of the Lost Soul’s face disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Only his mouth moved last.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please take care of those two…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The two must be Seong Jiah and Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay. Leave it to me and rest.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps hearing Seong Jihan’s answer, the Lost Soul completely disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  He looked at it with mixed feelings and turned his back.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud. Thud.
 </p>
 <p>
  He headed towards the core of the abyss owner that was slowly fading away.
 </p>
 <p>
  He grabbed it and.
 </p>
 <p>
  Poof!
 </p>
 <p>
  He pressed it directly onto the mask.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The white flames of the Sacred Flame springing up from inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The void processors are merging.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sacred Flame burning from the sphere quickly incinerated the mask.
 </p>
 <p>
  The white flames soon attached to Seong Jihan’s face.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Will you absorb the merged void processor?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The mask that was breaking apart asked if he would devour the void processor combined with the core.
 </p>
 <p>
  Following the administrator’s arm, this was another bomb.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Absorb it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who had already decided to push himself, had no hesitation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack…!
 </p>
 <p>
  A sound of something splitting came from the half of the face where the mask was worn.
 </p>
 <p>
  And.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Oh… Seong Jihan’s face…
 </p>
 <p>
  – It cracked similarly to that opponent earlier…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wh-What, is this also being dominated?
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers noticed the change.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the half of Seong Jihan’s face where he wore the half-mask.
 </p>
 <p>
  Like the Lost Soul’s, there were cracks.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, it wasn’t cracked all over like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the line rising from the end of his chin to his cheek.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a fissure that seemed to carve his face at any moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…The absorption went well.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan touched it and smiled bitterly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Following the arm, the change in the partially cracked face.
 </p>
 <p>
  His body was gradually transforming into non-human flesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the reward for absorbing this was that great.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Void increases by 300.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The limit of void stat accommodation is set to 999.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps related to the administrator’s arm, the void that increased by 300.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition, the void limit that had been hindering Seong Jihan until now was greatly raised to 999.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since the void processor has entered the body like this, it must have become like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The more you use the power of the void, the more erosion will slowly progress.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned at the subsequent message.
 </p>
 <p>
  The void limit is 999, but why is the void erosion progressing?
 </p>
 <p>
  At this rate, isn’t it no different from a time-limited power?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, it’s not just this that’s time-limited.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The incomplete half of the face.
 </p>
 <p>
  The incomplete arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition to the eternity inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  Everything is a powder keg that could explode at any moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wouldn’t be strange if it eroded him right now.
 </p>
 <p>
  But.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Don’t worry about the two.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the key he had received.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Lost Soul was willing to abandon 7 billion to save the two.
 </p>
 <p>
  But still, the best ending would be to save both the 7 billion and the two, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  “This time, I will definitely put a complete end to it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The power he gained by pushing himself a bit for that purpose.
 </p>
 <p>
  These just need to not explode until he fights Moosin.
 </p>
 <p>
  If they endure like that, they will become a solid foundation for him when he challenges them.
 </p>
 <p>
  And.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The amazing achievement Yggdrasil mentioned… I can attempt it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  His eyes sank deep.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the star of Marital God, Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  […Huh.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking at Seong Jihan’s arm, The Martial God sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was going to activate the Golden Wheel unconditionally, regardless of whether he won or lost.
 </p>
 <p>
  [To accept the arm like that.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A variable had appeared.

  Chapter 415
 </p>
 <p>
  Shortly after absorbing the power of void and red from Taiji.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Before going home, I should check myself first.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who gained a tremendous amount of power this time, decided to check his condition before returning home.
 </p>
 <p>
  Currently, not only did he have the administrator’s hand implanted, but the void processor was also completely embedded in his face.
 </p>
 <p>
  His current state was no different from a walking time bomb.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The void training room that upgraded after surpassing level 500 should be fine for testing my power.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As he entered the void training room like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You did it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The owner of the arena was already waiting there.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You came again? I guess you’re not a busy person.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I am busy, but this matter takes top priority.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He calmly answered Seong Jihan’s words and looked at his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Since you came to the training room, I suppose the hand hasn’t devoured you yet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why do you think that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Because if the administrator’s hand had dominated you, there’s no way it would come here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aha.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If the administrator’s hand dominates Seong Jihan, there’s no reason to purposely enter the void training room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded his head and looked at his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  His right hand back where red eyes flashed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I was gathering information but it got cut off coming in here… But I found out amazing results. As expected, the main body was the main body.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike before, it sent its meaning to him from the inside without displaying text on the outside.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Why am I the main body?’
 </p>
 <p>
  [I’ll tell you once that guy leaves.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though the administrator’s hand has settled as his right arm, it still seems to be mindful of the arena owner.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Got it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan answered like that and looked at the arena owner.
 </p>
 <p>
  The cosmic face wearing a hat.
 </p>
 <p>
  He looked at Seong Jihan and blinked his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The reason I came here is because of the void processor.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why, you want to rip off the face?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’d like to do that if I could, but the higher-up didn’t allow it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it’s his higher-up, it would be the Black Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it wasn’t for the administrator, his face might have really been ripped off.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, I was wondering. Would you be willing to donate your face? That person also wouldn’t stop you if you say you’ll give it yourself.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I might donate it if you cleanly deal with Martial God for me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s unfortunate. That kind of intervention against him is impossible for us.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why not?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s complicated to explain… Just think that there are restrictions for the void to directly intervene.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm. Then I can’t give you the face.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan touched his cracked chin.
 </p>
 <p>
  The void processor that not only increased his void by 300 but also changed his capacity limit to 999.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the crack that started from the end of his face, it was unknown when it would expand.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’m carrying around two bombs.’
 </p>
 <p>
  And they’re attached to the arm and face at that.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, if it’s going to explode anyway, he should detonate it in front of Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan was thinking about the things fused to his body like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I guess donating is difficult after all. Then, let’s get to the main point.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Main point?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ziiing…
 </p>
 <p>
  Light bloomed from the two stars shining within the cosmic face.
 </p>
 <p>
  The arena owner displayed a large screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This time, the arena will hold an event called the ‘Beginner’s Arena’.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Beginner’s Arena.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s an event that gathers races that haven’t reached the intermediate level and gives them evolution bonuses.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Below intermediate.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. We will also provide full participation opportunities so that players from the Diamond League can participate.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan blinked his eyes upon hearing this.
 </p>
 <p>
  The conditions the arena owner was listing out somehow.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…It perfectly aligns with humanity’s situation. Is it just my feeling?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No. This Beginner’s Arena is an event tailored for humanity. The participation conditions and rewards. It’s set up so that humanity can take the evolution bonuses.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The arena owner readily affirmed Seong Jihan’s question.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why is that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Because humanity needs to become an intermediate race as soon as possible. The higher-ups want to give them that opportunity.”
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  “The administrator…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Still, the management can’t directly give evolution bonuses to a single race, so they prepared the board.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As humanity evolved from the lowest to lower tier.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Black and White Administrators, who properly recognized this race and began monitoring Martial God entangled with them.
 </p>
 <p>
  If they go from lower to intermediate, they will be able to examine humanity more closely.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…And if what Yggdrasil said is true. It will be possible to confirm through the race’s evolution whether the human race itself is the Red Administrator’s race.’
 </p>
 <p>
  On the surface, it’s an unbeatable offer for humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the ‘Beginner’s Arena’ contained various intentions.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, it’s not like he could refuse this either.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, and Seong Jihan-nim will be excluded from this event.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re saying I can’t participate?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Only players belonging to the Diamond and Master Leagues can participate.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you’re going to push it anyway, you should have let me participate too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You are currently receiving considerable attention on BattleTube. If we host an unfair event called the Beginner’s Arena, strong protests will come in.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I thought the administrator wouldn’t care about player protests.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s bothersome to have unnecessary noise.”
 </p>
 <p>
  So, they set the conditions to exclude the high-profile Seong Jihan from participating.
 </p>
 <p>
  And have only human players participate in the Beginner’s Arena?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It doesn’t seem like that’s the only reason… This guy won’t tell me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s the arena owner who gave an absurd excuse that he excluded him because protests are bothersome.
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s no way the real reason will come out even if he probes him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So please encourage humanity to participate in this event. Tell them to take many evolution bonuses.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You really want to make humanity intermediate no matter what.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, that is the will of the higher-ups.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  The arena owner looked at Seong Jihan’s arm for a moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, I will take my leave now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The end? If you were just going to inform me about the Beginner’s Arena, you didn’t need to come in person.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Among my errands, checking on Seong Jihan-nim’s condition was also one. Since you seem fine, I’ll go now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay. Bye.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan waved his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The arena owner disappeared into the darkness.
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as he left.
 </p>
 <p>
  [As expected of rank 4, quite annoying.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Rank 4?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Back in my time, he was void rank 4.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Previously, he heard from the Shadow Queen that the arena owner was within the top 20 in the void.
 </p>
 <p>
  But he didn’t know he was such a high-ranking existence.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seeing him come all the way here, he must have been concerned about you after all.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Seems so. I have no intention of devouring the main body, but he seems to be misunderstanding.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, what’s the amazing result you found out earlier?”𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ah, that. Main body. You’ll have no choice but to be surprised by this. Your race…!!]
 </p>
 <p>
  As he was dragging it out mentioning the race, Seong Jihan responded indifferently.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Don’t tell me humanity turned out to be the Red Administrator. Is that what you’re trying to say?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [?? How did you already know?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yggdrasil told me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Green figured it out? Oh no…]
 </p>
 <p>
  The administrator’s hand was perplexed by Seong Jihan’s answer.
 </p>
 <p>
  But he wasn’t feeling too great either.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I guess what Yggdrasil said wasn’t a lie.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the Red Administrator’s hand react like this following Yggdrasil.
 </p>
 <p>
  Is it certain that the real Red Administrator has permeated the human race itself?
 </p>
 <p>
  [This won’t do. We need to quickly evolve humanity and proceed with the fusion process before Green interferes.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Fusion, huh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [If we burn this planet with the sacred flame, all of humanity will return to the main body. Then the main body can regain its former power. No, if humanity becomes intermediate, it may become even stronger.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then I will disappear too, and only the Red Administrator will remain.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [? That’s not the case. The main body possesses the most outstanding qualifications of a Red among humanity. The main body will become the new Red Administrator. Ascending from human to administrator!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The hand that said to burn all of humanity in sacred flame and become the new Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan listened silently to its words and then asked it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s think about that after evolution. Why do I have the qualifications of the main body?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [What kind of question is that? You have the ability, so you’re the main body.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m curious as to why it’s me. Is there something like a bloodline for the Red’s qualifications?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s just random.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Random, you say?”
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  [If the qualifications are inherited through bloodline, the risk is too great when that bloodline disappears. The power manifesting in the main body occurred by chance.]
 </p>
 <p>
  He thought there was something in the family, but guess not?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded his head for now upon hearing those words.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Anyway, after humanity’s evolution, I will diligently assist and spread the sacred flame across this entire planet.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. It would be better after evolution than now. That way, the administrator’s fire can be absorbed more strongly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Right. Just endure a bit.]
 </p>
 <p>
  He doesn’t need to unnecessarily say he has no intention of doing that when he hasn’t even fully dominated this arm yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan was playing along with the administrator’s hand for now.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Until then is the deadline to dominate this arm.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He stared blankly at his right arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he doesn’t ignite the sacred flame even after the race evolves, this guy will probably try to rebel.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If we don’t acquire evolution bonuses in the Beginner’s Arena. The deadline will be pushed back.’
 </p>
 <p>
  But it’s not like he can tell people not to receive evolution bonuses.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he acted like that, this arm would cause a ruckus asking why.
 </p>
 <p>
  For now, as he proceeded with the work.
 </p>
 <p>
  He’ll have to take control of the arm before humanity evolves to intermediate.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan made up his mind to play along with the guy’s tune until then.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I’m glad the main body knows to wait. The previous main body was too impatient and ruined things.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What did the previous Red do?’
 </p>
 <p>
  [Overdid it trying to achieve an achievement and became an administrator too early. Should have proceeded with the proper process…]
 </p>
 <p>
  The administrator’s hand unexpectedly talked about something.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Achievement?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Subjugated a great constellation before becoming a constellation.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s eyes flashed at those words.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ‘amazing achievement’ Yggdrasil had mentioned.
 </p>
 <p>
  Is that related to this?
 </p>
 <p>
  “The achievement needed to become an administrator… was to defeat a great constellation before becoming a constellation?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Originally, after becoming a great constellation, the proper route is to gather power and wait. But if you achieve an achievement that shakes the entire universe like the previous main body subjugating a great constellation… a new path to becoming an administrator opens up.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “How did Red do that? The difference in power must have been immense.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Simple. Was stronger than the great constellation.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, I see…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The answer was simple for once.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan responded like that and thought about the amazing achievement.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Yggdrasil said if I achieve it, it will recommend me as a temporary administrator.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Achieve an amazing achievement.
 </p>
 <p>
  Become a temporary administrator and edit humanity, as Yggdrasil said.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had no intention of fully following those words, but he still wanted to find out the method itself.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unexpectedly, he was able to find a hint about the amazing achievement from Red’s hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Can I defeat a great constellation…?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan examined his own condition.
 </p>
 <p>
  At this level, he could handle even high-level constellations.
 </p>
 <p>
  But great constellations were opponents of a different class.
 </p>
 <p>
  On top of that.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Where do I meet those guys.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The great constellations Seong Jihan was aware of right now were two.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dragon Lord and Sun King.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the Sun King’s whereabouts were unknown.
 </p>
 <p>
  And although Dragon Lord was his sponsoring constellation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I couldn’t be summoned to his lair because I’m not a constellation.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [The great constellation ‘Dragon Lord’ is trying to summon the player to his lair for full-fledged sponsorship.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Player Seong Jihan failed to obtain the ‘Constellation’ qualification and is not eligible to respond to the ‘Great Constellation’s summon.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recalled the system messages he had seen before.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the end, with this.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether it’s Dragon Lord or Sun King.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s a situation where it’s difficult to even meet and challenge them.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…For now, I should be satisfied with finding a clue to that achievement.’
 </p>
 <p>
  After organizing his thoughts like that, Seong Jihan touched his cracked face.
 </p>
 <p>
  The void processor absorbed into his face was still in a very stable state.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Still, for now, both of them won’t explode right away.’
 </p>
 <p>
  After finishing his inspection like that, Seong Jihan exited the training room again.
 </p>
 <p>
  And what he saw upon returning home was none other than.
 </p>
 <p>
  […Okay. You. Know it’s thanks to Seah. I don’t care where you live. Just don’t appear in front of me.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The divorce commotion unfolding at home.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then let’s proceed with the divorce process like that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That, that’s… the end?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan ignored Yoon Seah who wanted him to mediate this situation and.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The arena owner made a proposal to me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Brought up the story about the ‘Beginner’s Arena’.

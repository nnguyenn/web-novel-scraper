 </p>
 <p>
  A day later, in the Daegi guild office of Sword Palace.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…So now, the arena will soon invite humanity to the Beginner’s Arena.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan brought up the story about the Beginner’s Arena through the guild channel for the first time in a while.
 </p>
 <p>
  -An arena that gives evolution bonuses…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Beginner… These conditions fit us perfectly, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  -I feel like the energy of the universe is gathering towards humanity…
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon hearing the explanation about the Beginner’s Arena and that the participation conditions fit humanity perfectly.
 </p>
 <p>
  People’s reactions were generally positive.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But if only Diamond and Master can participate, Seong Jihan can’t go… Then won’t he just be a spectator there?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ah, right. If Seong Jihan can’t go, I don’t think we can get evolution bonuses lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -No no, it should still be doable among the same lower-tier races. We’re quite strong too.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, it was unfortunate that Seong Jihan, humanity’s ace card, couldn’t participate.
 </p>
 <p>
  But as the level of human players had risen significantly compared to before, it was expected that they would bring back quite a lot of evolution bonuses.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Boss, then regarding the Beginner’s Arena, have the detailed match contents not been released yet?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, that’s right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aha, I see. Then let’s wrap up the news related to the Beginner’s Arena here…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon glanced at the chat window and changed the subject.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Boss, how is your body doing? When you implanted the administrator’s arm, everyone was startled. And is it just the arm? Even your face got injured…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “My body is fine.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Tap. Tap.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan tapped his head with his finger as he said that.
 </p>
 <p>
  “My mind is the same too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing Seong Jihan’s appearance not much different from usual, people were relieved.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh, I guess he’s not being dominated…
 </p>
 <p>
  -The administrator’s hand is nothing special either, huh?
 </p>
 <p>
  -I was really shocked yesterday lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -But why did the owner of the abyss look exactly like Seong Jihan?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Who knows lol. Is it a monster like a doppelganger?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is that so? But it seemed desperate when giving the key…
 </p>
 <p>
  “The owner of the abyss… Who knows. I’ll leave it to your speculation. And.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the guild channel chat and added one more thing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “My sister was also released from the abyss this time and returned home. Although she’s not in the ‘human’ state right now, there will come a day when she can greet you once her body condition returns.”
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh?!
 </p>
 <p>
  -Seong Jiah-nim is also back… Come to think of it, she sponsored.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But why is she not in the human state? Shiver
 </p>
 <p>
  -Who cares, at least she’s back hehe
 </p>
 <p>
  -With one more supporter added, our country will dominate this championship too.
 </p>
 <p>
  -We originally dominated lol
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon the news that Saintess Seong Jiah was released from the abyss, people showed great interest.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Since Seong Jiah-nim has returned, we should reserve a spot in the waiting guild too!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, who knows when she’ll return to being human. I gave her the key, but she’s not using it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh… Why isn’t she using it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s what I’m saying.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jiah put the key in her inventory and said she still can’t return from the constellation state.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned as he recalled his stubborn sister who wouldn’t come back even when he told her to.
 </p>
 <p>
  She became even more stubborn after going to the abyss.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, everyone. I will take my leave now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After Seong Jihan finished the broadcast through the guild channel like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon lowered her voice tone and asked him a question.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Boss, Boss! That… Earlier. I met Yoon Sejin-nim, is that true?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The divorce?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, yes…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. The two of them agreed to do that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  So it’s true.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon nodded her head with a surprised face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s probably… Because of Shizuru from before…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, well. There’s that too. And because in the extinction scenarios my sister saw, the result was always brother-in-law betraying. She says she absolutely can’t live with him.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Extinction scenarios… Is it a future similar to the one Boss played before?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon hearing those words, Lee Hayeon showed interest in this.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The future… I’m curious about how I was in the future the Priestess saw.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Regarding your future. I do know a bit too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, really? Did the Priestess say something?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I didn’t hear it from my sister, but.”
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  Tap. Tap.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan tapped his cracked face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I got some information from here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Actually, it was information he obtained before the regression, but there’s no need to purposely say he regressed.
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s words, Lee Hayeon’s eyes sparkled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow, how is the future me?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The 2nd guild leader of American First. Always ruining the family due to gambling addiction, and only blabbering drunk from alcohol addiction.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I heard your nickname was Zero. Because your entire assets were always 0 won.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ahem… That’s really…. Ladylike.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lim Gayeong, who was behind, tried hard to hold back her sneer and fake coughed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What, what are you saying! It’s been ages since I quit gambling, no, match prediction!!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “In my sister’s extinction scenarios, I didn’t show this much presence. What if you hadn’t become the Daegi guild master and remained as the vice-leader of that guild like before?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, then…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then she would have betted again aiming for a big hit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon couldn’t refute Lim Gayeong’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  The reason she took her hands off betting this time was not only because she was the Daegi guild master, but also because she desperately tried not to show the image of a gambling addict to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  If she were in her old guild like before, she definitely would have recklessly betted money again saying she’s analyzing the match.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Being the Daegi guild’s master right now is the most hopeful route.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right. Please take care of me in the future too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, but.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon approached Seong Jihan and looked at his face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re really okay, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No abnormalities yet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Saying ‘yet’ bothers me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, I don’t know what will happen in the future either.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When fighting Martial God, he’ll pour out all the power he has.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that time, these bombs might all explode.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking like that, Seong Jihan got up from his seat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, I’ll go train a bit now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, Boss. Before you go, I’ll bring the guild’s performance report. Yesterday, calls from the leaders of each country flooded in asking about Boss’s well-being, shouldn’t we respond to them?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll leave all the work entirely to Hayeon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He’s already busy controlling his power, he can’t take on miscellaneous tasks too.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan disappeared in the blink of an eye, Lee Hayeon sighed looking at his empty seat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…No, does Boss have any awareness that this is his guild?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “These days, well, he hasn’t been doing any work at all. Hayeon, you should also make people work and do things comfortably.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sigh… I have to. But it’s awkward to make others respond to calls from the leaders of each country. Gayeong, do you want to talk to the US President?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I politely decline.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…In the end, I have to do it again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon held her throbbing head with her fingers.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  At the penthouse of Sword Palace.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Dad… Is that all your luggage?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, I just need clothes to change into.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Sejin, who decided to leave the house, was standing in front of the front door with just one suitcase.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then Seah. Dad will live downstairs, so let’s see each other often.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, I’ll go with you, Dad!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, who came out to see Yoon Sejin off, glanced back.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mom, I can go and come back, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jiah, who was spewing void fog because she didn’t even want to see Yoon Sejin’s face.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Sure. Go and come back.]
 </p>
 <p>
  She readily let her go.
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  Beep.
 </p>
 <p>
  The two, father and daughter, took the elevator and went down.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not long after they left like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan popped out of the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh? Brother-in-law left already?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yeah. Don’t call him brother-in-law anymore, call him Yoon Sejin from now on.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Brother-in-law is a habit… Okay. I’ll fix it gradually. I thought packing would take time, but it ended quickly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan had planned to go to the training room and check his power before Yoon Sejin went to the downstairs house.
 </p>
 <p>
  But he already finished packing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll have to greet him later.”
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  [Do that. Did you take care of your business well in the training room?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. I tested controlling my power a bit. It’s still fine for now. Both of them listen to me better than I thought.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who had taken refuge in the training room to avoid Lee Hayeon’s report after the announcement through the guild channel.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had finished power control to some extent.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘With this much, I can use it right away in the Challenger League.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Starting today, he should queue up for Challenger games too.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan thought like that and looked at his arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s a relief. But Jihan. But when you were announcing earlier, who is that guild master next to you? She was quite a beauty.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s no relationship, she’s a business partner.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’re not dating?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re not in that kind of relationship.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jiah probed the relationship between Seong Jihan and Lee Hayeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’re satisfied with just a business relationship with that kind of lady? Jihan. You should meet someone too now!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I never thought I’d hear nagging about dating from a sister who’s divorcing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s why I’m saying it even more. If you meet and marry just one person like me, you might end up divorcing like this.]
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s good that he freed his sister, but it feels like a nagger has entered the house.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan waved his hand dismissively.
 </p>
 <p>
  “When I take down Martial God, I’ll do it even if you don’t nag.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s strange. You acted like Casanova in the US…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s that now? Is that a future my sister saw?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yeah. There were cases where you settled down with that lady named Sophia, but there were also many cases where I thought you went too far even though you’re my younger brother. I saw up to 9 partners at most.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Back then, all the family members died too, and Korea was engulfed by dungeon nukes and perished.
 </p>
 <p>
  So he just lived like a ruffian in the US.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan briefly recalled his life from his previous life and frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But I didn’t go up to 9 partners.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the Seong Jihans in the abyss, were there even such cases?
 </p>
 <p>
  [So, meet them one by one later and don’t cheat when you’re older.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll do that after cutting Martial God’s head off, so don’t worry. Sister, do you have any good information? You’re still the Witch of the Void.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Information? I’m still a body belonging to the void, so I can’t speak carelessly. If I do that, you might not be able to use the key you worked hard to get.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then use the key right away and talk a bit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […I’m planning to stay like this at least until the Beginner’s Arena ends. I’m going to pour all my power into Seah.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Use the key after that. Really.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I’ll try.]
 </p>
 <p>
  If she answered like that, she wouldn’t do it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at her with a frown, then suddenly thought of something and asked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sister, do you know Pythia by any chance?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Pythia… Ah, I saw her during your constellation-related mission. Wasn’t she one of humanity’s sovereign constellations?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. She’s Martial God’s disciple, and she said when you’re freed from being the Witch of the Void, she’ll be dragged to become the Witch of the Void.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Really? She said when I’m freed, she’ll become the Witch of the Void?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, because she has the Divine Eye.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I see… I have no idea about that.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, Seong Jiah summoned the Divine Eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Owner of the Abyss… After your other self disappeared, this Divine Eye weakened too. The power to see the future is gone, and it can only see far places now.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Its role ends at being a telescope?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [A telescope, you say. The Divine Eye isn’t that low-class. If I want to see Seah now, I can immediately bring her up.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As light flashed in the Divine Eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  The scene of Yoon Sejin and Yoon Seah lightly hugging and exchanging farewells appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Like this.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s the effective range of the Divine Eye? Is outside the universe possible?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [No. Even if I use all its abilities, the entire Earth is the maximum.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Then seeing Tuseong was impossible.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…It’s not very useful, huh?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Whenever our side gains such an authority, it weakens.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan was looking at the Divine Eye with disappointment like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  Beep. Beep beep!
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, who had seen Yoon Sejin off and returned, rushed into the house.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle! Uncle! Did you see the message?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What message?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That half-elf community! I logged in with Uncle’s phone too!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, I didn’t see it. I don’t carry my phone in the first place.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When entering the void training room, the cell phone would break down.
 </p>
 <p>
  So after not carrying it around, it ended up always being plugged into the charger in Seong Jihan’s room.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I thought you’d be like that! Look, Uncle. A meaningful message came from Gilgamesh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, Yoon Seah showed Seong Jihan the message.
 </p>
 <p>
  In it.
 </p>
 <p>
  [By Martial God’s order, I came down to Earth with Pythia…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Seong Jihan, let’s eliminate her on this opportunity. How about it?]
 </p>
 <p>
  There was a message from Gilgamesh suggesting to eliminate Pythia.

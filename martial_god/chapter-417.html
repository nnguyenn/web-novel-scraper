  Chapter 417
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh requested cooperation, he asked to eliminate Pythia.
 </p>
 <p>
  This situation became strange.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Pythia’s condition did become weird after the last coronation ceremony…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia, who said she didn’t know why she was a sovereign constellation, and whose condition became somewhat strange after that.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lately, there was no contact from her either.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead, Gilgamesh did say he would cooperate after realizing he was deceived by Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He didn’t send much information until now, and suddenly says to eliminate Pythia.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia and Gilgamesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Both of them are ultimately Martial God’s disciples, and ambiguous existences to trust.
 </p>
 <p>
  This proposal, in a way, could it be a trap?
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s hard to easily believe suddenly saying to eliminate Pythia. Explain the circumstances a bit.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [So suspicious. I’ll show you what happened.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Ziiing…
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, a link rose from the message window.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, the phone’s owner, showed a cautious look as she saw that.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is it okay to click this? Isn’t there malicious code embedded?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…No matter what, would a constellation Gilgamesh embed malicious code?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle. You have to be careful and careful again with these things.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay. Then I’ll click it on my phone. I barely use it anyway.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan brought his cell phone from the room and entered the link.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then a video played.
 </p>
 <p>
  In it, Martial God was flashing two red lights in the darkness.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Why did you call me? I was diligently keeping the administrators’ watchers in check according to your orders.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [A more urgent matter has come up. Gilgamesh.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [What is it?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Humanity has received an invitation from the arena and is trying to evolve one step further.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [What’s the problem with that? Isn’t it a good thing?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [It would be good for you, the king of humans. But for Tuseong, the administrators’ surveillance will become more intense…]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Black and White Administrators, who narrowed their surveillance network as if they were waiting after humanity was upgraded to a lower race.
 </p>
 <p>
  If humanity upgraded to intermediate here, the administrators’ observation could become even sharper.
 </p>
 <p>
  But Martial God’s next words were unexpected.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I will fulfill my promise with you in advance. I will let you go down to Earth with Pythia and take back the laboratory.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Is that… really true?!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes, Pythia. Guide him to where the laboratory is.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Understood. Martial God.]
 </p>
 <p>
  […For now, I’ll gratefully accept.]
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, the screen darkened.
 </p>
 <p>
  The short video ended like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  And Yoon Seah, who watched this video together, expressed doubt as if it was absurd.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh… Uncle. Isn’t this cut off in the middle?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Strange, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. Martial God seemed to be keeping humanity’s evolution in check, why is he suddenly giving the laboratory?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can’t tell with just this. Let’s ask this guy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After finishing the video playback and returning to the half-elf community screen, Seong Jihan sent a message again.
 </p>
 <p>
  [What’s the laboratory? Why does that come up while talking about humanity?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The current humanity was constructed with me as the starting point.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’re denying the theory of evolution that monkeys became humans.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [No. Evolution is also true. I was also… Right. One of the Homo sapiens.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Even Homo sapiens is coming out now.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was dumbfounded seeing the message, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  [But among the countless humans, I was the only one who survived in the laboratory. And I sowed my sacred seed, and my descendants flourished and developed humanity.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon seeing the additional message Gilgamesh sent, the experiment scene he had seen before came to mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  The experiment where the Blood clan put humanity in test tubes and burned them, and saved only Gilgamesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Did he, the sole survivor, spread his bloodline after that?
 </p>
 <p>
  [Well, most of them were useless ones… But there were outstanding talents like you too. Yes. I will acknowledge you. As Gilgamesh’s blood relative.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [I don’t need such a thing.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Huhu. Being acknowledged as a descendant of the king of humans. Be grateful.]
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  [Enough. Let’s talk about the laboratory. Why do you need that?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [I can’t see my descendants without going through the laboratory.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Is that so?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. In the beginning, it’s a side effect of sowing so many seeds there.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  So he needs the laboratory now to see his children?
 </p>
 <p>
  [You said humanity is your descendants. But why are you trying to see children again?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [If there were only outstanding ones like you, it would be fine. But most of them are useless, aren’t they? I need to see new descendants and complete Gilgamesh’s blood relatives again.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A truly noble reason beyond comparison.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided not to probe further about the laboratory.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead, he focused on the original purpose.
 </p>
 <p>
  [What’s the reason for trying to eliminate Pythia?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [What are you saying? Of course, it’s because she’s Martial God’s faithful disciple.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Really? But she used to bring me quite a lot of information before.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hmph. She did such things? I noticed from before that she was rolling her eyes recklessly and having useless thoughts… But. She changed after becoming aware that she’s a Sovereign constellation.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [After the coronation ceremony?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. A mere prophet being Sovereign constellation level 8… Does that make any sense? At first, it seemed like she couldn’t believe it herself. She changed quickly. And…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh paused for a moment, then sent a message again.
 </p>
 <p>
  [She became strong. Tremendously.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Became strong…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [I had a chance to perform a mission together recently. It was incomparable to before. She handled the power of a sovereign constellation too easily.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Even you feel threatened?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Threatened, my ass! How can a king lose to a mere prophet? It’s just that Martial God’s right hand is sufficient with Dongbang Sak. This woman is completely unexpected.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh flared up at Seong Jihan’s words but showed wariness about Pythia’s strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  If this prideful guy talked like this, she definitely became strong…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If Pythia transformed to be that loyal to Martial God, it would be right to eliminate her on this opportunity.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Seong Jihan didn’t find Gilgamesh very trustworthy.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It seems like things fail whenever this guy lays his hands on them.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Until now, Gilgamesh was hostile to Seong Jihan, so his failure was Seong Jihan’s success.
 </p>
 <p>
  But if they cooperate this time, they would be in the same boat, so the story was different.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The plan?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Come to the laboratory. I can control that place. Let’s trap Pythia there and attack her together.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Attack together… You intend to fully rebel against Martial God?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  [I won’t do it openly yet. I’ll just say the laboratory’s devices went out of control. While blocking external communication, I will detain Pythia. You just need to fight her at the right timing.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Somehow I feel like I’m doing all the fighting.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [If I reveal my true colors to Martial God, won’t the one who informs you about Tuseong disappear? Still, I will bind her legs with chains, so it will be of great help in battle.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is he saying he’ll help to the maximum extent without getting caught by Martial God?’
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan looked at the message like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Jihan… Isn’t this too risky? If Gilgamesh betrays, you might have to fight two constellations.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s true.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mom is right! Even if he doesn’t betray, the plan seems too flimsy. He talks as if he can perfectly control the laboratory that hasn’t even been found yet… Is detaining a constellation named Pythia as easy as he says…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jiah and Yoon Seah, who were looking at the messages together, expressed their unease about Gilgamesh’s plan like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I think so too. That guy’s plans always failed whenever I used them. This time too, it doesn’t seem like it will go as he says.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really? Then it’s better not to go after all…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But if they get block me to that extent, I won’t be able to beat Martial God either.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s ultimate goal was the wandering Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  After all those two weren’t Dongbang Sak but merely slightly strong constellations.
 </p>
 <p>
  How would he fight Martial God if he couldn’t even overcome them?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Rather, it’s better to eliminate them now when the void processor and arm are listening to me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan made up his mind to go like that and sent a message.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Okay. I’ll go. Where is the laboratory located?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The location is…]
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  2 days later.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan set foot on an island in the Pacific.
 </p>
 <p>
  A tiny island located north of the Australian continent.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was clearly the location of the laboratory Gilgamesh informed, but.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  ‘Is this really the right place…?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked around the island.
 </p>
 <p>
  The island densely packed with palm trees looked completely unrelated to the laboratory Gilgamesh mentioned.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The roots of the trees rose from the ground and touched Seong Jihan’s feet.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’re here. You found it well.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh’s voice was heard through the roots.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The laboratory will open soon. Pythia is releasing the seal, so come in right away when I send the signal.]
 </p>
 <p>
  He was already excited at the thought of a surprise attack, his voice slightly agitated.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He didn’t know if things will go as he intended, but for now, he should hide his presence as much as possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan was waiting with that thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ziiing…
 </p>
 <p>
  The red eyes on his right hand flashed and sent a voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Oh, main body…! This place, it’s not ordinary.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Do you feel something?’
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s sealed now, but it’s quite an interesting place… Can I analyze this place in my own way? Perhaps, I might be able to take over this space.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Really? Then try it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  After telling the cooperative Red’s hand to investigate, Seong Jihan waited for Gilgamesh’s signal.
 </p>
 <p>
  And after waiting for a while.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rumble…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The entire island began to shake greatly.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Get ready. Soon, the laboratory will open.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as those words ended.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ziiing…!
 </p>
 <p>
  From the center of the island, a huge red light burst out and shot up into the sky all at once.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clearly, it was a tremendous authority of Red.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Oh, main body! We have to go there! If we go, we can make this facility ours!]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But it’s Gilgamesh’s.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [What are you saying? The main body is the owner of everything imbued with the Red’s authority! He can’t claim ownership.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Hey.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘For once, you’re saying something I like.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Okay. Let’s take it and return it if it’s useless.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan heard those words and tried to depart.
 </p>
 <p>
  [S-Seong Jihan! Come here quickly!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Just in time, Gilgamesh also sent a voice to him through the roots to come quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  His voice sounded much more urgent than before.
 </p>
 <p>
  Somehow it felt ominous.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Did he fail again, this guy.’
 </p>
 <p>
  he had a feeling, but as expected, he ruined things.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought he should prepare thoroughly and raised his power tightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I shouldn’t turn on BattleTube and observe the situation for now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  After all, the goal of this plan was to eliminate Martial God’s disciple Pythia with a surprise attack.
 </p>
 <p>
  But there’s no need to advertise ‘I’m killing her’ to the whole world through BattleTube.
 </p>
 <p>
  With that thought, Seong Jihan approached the center of the island without turning on the channel.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the middle of the red light.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hello~ Seong Jihan. Long time no see?”
 </p>
 <p>
  A woman was waving her hand with a bright face.
 </p>
 <p>
  She had red hair and blue eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike the smile on her face, her eyes were coldly sunk.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You already knew I was coming.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, to some extent. I’m a prophet, you know?”𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, she stomped the ground with her foot.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kwajik!
 </p>
 <p>
  And what was revealed under her feet was.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh, urgh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Hey. You didn’t say you weren’t threatened.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The face of Gilgamesh, crushed beyond recognition.

  Chapter 418
 </p>
 <p>
  The king of humans, trampled by a prophet.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if Pythia awakened herself as a Sovereign constellation, their levels should be equal, how did he get defeated so quickly?
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan looked at Gilgamesh with a cold gaze, he raised his face and made excuses.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This, this is…! Definitely not because I lack power.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re saying that well while being trampled on.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh…! The laboratory was already under her control! Pythia, what the hell did you do!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Gilgamesh gnashed his teeth and looked up at Pythia.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pfft.
 </p>
 <p>
  She smiled and brought her face close to him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Gilgamesh, don’t you remember me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Tap tap.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia pointed at her face with her finger while saying that.
 </p>
 <p>
  The smile on the outside looked bright, but the atmosphere she gave off was ominous beyond compare.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…What? Were they acquainted from before?’
 </p>
 <p>
  When Pythia talked about Gilgamesh before, it didn’t seem like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  After awakening herself as a Sovereign constellation, she definitely seemed to have changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  And.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What are you talking about? You’re just a prophet flunky.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Gilgamesh’s answer, the corners of Pythia’s mouth rose.
 </p>
 <p>
  “As expected, you’re stupid.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bam!
 </p>
 <p>
  As she kicked Gilgamesh’s head with her foot, his head exploded like a watermelon.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you doing!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps because he had the power of the World Tree, his head regenerated quickly, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your head explodes but grows back quickly? Wow, your regeneration is really good.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…To dare show such disrespect to the king. You will regret it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Regret… You dare utter that word?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps irked by the word regret, Pythia squatted down and slapped Gilgamesh’s cheek.
 </p>
 <p>
  Slap! Slap!CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh’s head exploding and regenerating repeatedly with each slap.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘She’s strong.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan gauged the opponent’s strength while looking at her hand movements.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia, who easily exploded Gilgamesh’s head like bursting a watermelon.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I should have done this sooner. I didn’t know blowing up your head was this fun.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How dare you…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Tremble.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh tried to move his body somehow, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  As if he was restrained by something, he could barely move his face.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing his own condition, he made a serious expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…How the hell did you control the laboratory?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You really don’t know me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How would I know a mere prophet more?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, Pythia pointed her index finger downward.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where is this place?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…The laboratory.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How could I control this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How would I know that!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, really.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia got up from her seat with a disgusted face and.
 </p>
 <p>
  Snap!
 </p>
 <p>
  As she flicked her finger, the red light spewing from the floor stopped and a new scenery was revealed.
 </p>
 <p>
  A huge dome-shaped space created from the center to the beach where Seong Jihan was.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unfocused red eyes were embedded in the walls and floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  And in the center, a withered and twisted red tree was located.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Th-The laboratory, how did you…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh, who shouted in surprise after seeing the surroundings.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan briefly looked around and moved towards Pythia.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Pythia. You were also related to this laboratory?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “As expected, you’re different from Gilgamesh who can’t take hints even when given.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Y-You’re related to the laboratory? There’s no way…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sigh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Poof!
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia pressed Gilgamesh’s head hard with her foot.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, his mouth entered the newly created laboratory floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  With his mouth blocked, he could only roll his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan blankly stared at that sight and opened his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your attitude is different from when you dealt with Gilgamesh last time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Last time, I couldn’t see much of my past and could only see the future.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you regain your memories while awakening as a Sovereign constellation?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Something like that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Before, you provided me with information… Did you newly realize loyalty to Martial God or something?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Loyalty…”
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Pythia smiled slightly and looked around the laboratory.
 </p>
 <p>
  “He demanded loyalty in exchange for taking me out of this hell. I’m just faithfully keeping my promise.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The laboratory… is hell?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right. You know the fact that the current humanity started from here, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Current humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Gilgamesh said, Homo sapiens may have existed before that, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  The current humanity, where each individual became a part of the Red Administrator, started from here.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. Gilgamesh said he sowed his sacred seed and his descendants flourished.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sacred, my ass.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bam!
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia, who kicked Gilgamesh’s head again with her foot.
 </p>
 <p>
  Grinned bitterly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then let me ask you one thing. Does a man give birth alone?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A woman… would be needed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right. It’s not like a baby will come out of his belly, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then don’t tell me. You were Gilgamesh’s mate?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mate, huh. What an unpleasant word to hear.”
 </p>
 <p>
  While saying that, Pythia touched the withered and twisted tree in the center.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But you’re right. I’m his first mate. Hmm… Right. If I compare it to a similar myth, I would be like Eve?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eve.
 </p>
 <p>
  Calling herself that, Pythia laughed hollowly.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Eve… Don’t tell me you mean Adam and Eve?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Adam and Eve, referred to as the beginning of humanity in the Bible.
 </p>
 <p>
  They lived in the paradise of the Garden of Eden, but were expelled because Eve fell for the snake’s temptation and ate the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Come to think of it, there’s a snake here too. Him.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recalled Martial God, who was called a ‘snake’, and asked Pythia.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then is this place the Garden of Eden? The scenery is too brutal for that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It was paradise for this guy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Tap!
 </p>
 <p>
  As Pythia flicked her finger, a screen popped up.
 </p>
 <p>
  In it, the laboratory wasn’t desolate like now.
 </p>
 <p>
  The eyes on the floor and walls moved properly, and the tree in the center exuded brilliant vitality.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The sole survivor of the initial experiment, Gilgamesh. He was the only one approved to sow seeds. Of course, at first they tried to just clone him because the process of human reproduction was cumbersome, but…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ziiing.
 </p>
 <p>
  The screen changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  In it, numerous Gilgameshes were standing inside test tubes.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Did the Blood clan clone him?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Since they were the Red Administrator’s clan, maybe they had that level of technology.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were a total of 500 Gilgameshes on the screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  As flames rose inside those test tubes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Except for just 1, all the Gilgamesh clones were burned and disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Like this, all the clones were burned except for the original Gilgamesh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmph… Of course! No matter how much you clone this body, you can’t surpass the real one…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “When did he raise his head again?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kwajik.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Gilgamesh purposely took out his face that was buried in the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia stomped on his head again, pushing it deep.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘She really seems to have bad feelings towards the real Gilgamesh.’
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how you look at it, those two are far from Adam and Eve.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought like that while looking at the changing screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Blood clan tried various experiments but they all failed, so in the end, they had no choice but to return to the traditional method.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The traditional method is.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia made a circular shape with her right hand and inserted and removed her left index finger from it.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the explicit gesture, Seong Jihan laughed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Eve is being vulgar.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, just call me Pythia. I shouldn’t have said Eve. Then I become an existence inseparable from this human.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia, who said she was Eve and then disliked it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Which beat should he match?
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was looking at her with a frown.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anyway, that’s why. For our Adam, no, Gilgamesh, this place became paradise.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ziiing…
 </p>
 <p>
  The screen changed again.
 </p>
 <p>
  In it, a man happily smiling while leaning against a tree and.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hundreds of naked women, without a single piece of clothing, were revering him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then Gilgamesh got up and laid one of the hundreds of women down…
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t particularly want to see that guy mating.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I agree with that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s request, the act video was skipped.
 </p>
 <p>
  After showing the paradise-like appearance for Gilgamesh like that, the screen changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then shall we take a look at the other side of paradise right away?”
 </p>
 <p>
  What appeared next was a screen of hundreds of women lying side by side.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Administer growth accelerator.]
 </p>
 <p>
  At the same time as that voice, understandable to Seong Jihan despite being an alien language, was heard.
 </p>
 <p>
  The women’s bellies swelled up.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>

 </div>
 <p>
  It grew so fast, like a balloon inflating.
 </p>
 <p>
  Giving a grotesque and sickening feeling to the human Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  And.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Extract.]
 </p>
 <p>
  When the bellies grew sufficiently.
 </p>
 <p>
  The bellies of hundreds of women were slit open at once, and fetuses were forcibly taken out and floated.
 </p>
 <p>
  The place those babies moved to was a huge test tube.
 </p>
 <p>
  There, although not as intense as the flames that burned Gilgamesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sufficient fire was burning to swallow the fetuses.
 </p>
 <p>
  The babies thrown into it, whoosh whoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  The flames burned fiercely and.
 </p>
 <p>
  [4 survivors.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Success rate 0.8 percent.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [A decent result.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [TL/N: wtf is this chapter lol]
 </p>
 <p>
  The satisfied voice of the Blood clan was heard.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is… a human factory.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right. Behind Gilgamesh’s paradise, there was a human livestock process.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…You were also one of the women lying there?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How nice would it have been if it was them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia said she was genuinely envious of the women whose bellies were forcibly slit open and had their babies taken away.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you give birth to just five babies, you can die.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Then what about you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I unfortunately had a 10 percent success rate. Perhaps because I was his wife even before becoming a human test subject. Uselessly had good compatibility.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You were his wife even before becoming a test subject?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We lived together before he was kidnapped. Back then, he was the most decent among the tribe. Turned out he was trash.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since Gilgamesh was also a test subject kidnapped to the laboratory.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wouldn’t be strange for him to have a wife before being kidnapped.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Y-You! Don’t tell me, you’re the woman who ran away… The name. That… I’m sure, you had a name…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh, who started speaking while desperately raising his head despite being stepped on by Pythia.
 </p>
 <p>
  But when he couldn’t remember the name till the end.
 </p>
 <p>
  “See. He’s this stupid, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia grinned and stomped his head into the ground again.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I also ate the fruit of life, not just him. Why is my memory so good.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You also consumed the fruit of the World Tree.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, they forcibly made me eat it saying my performance was good. So I became too healthy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Tap. Tap.
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, Pythia pointed at the women on the screen with her finger.
 </p>
 <p>
  The women with uniformly blank faces.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even when their bellies were slit open and their babies fell into the pit of fire, they showed little reaction.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hallucinogens should work on me like these friends, but it didn’t work because of the fruit of the World Tree.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Became too healthy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. So every time, my belly was slit open. I had no choice but to watch my baby fall into the pit of fire while being fully conscious. How many did I give birth to… Over 1,000. Less than 10,000? Ah. It’s 7,342. Because I gave birth in two days with growth accelerators, it turned out like that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Hee hee. Hee hee.
 </p>
 <p>
  She giggled while looking at the burning babies.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the outside, it just looked like a smile with strength drained, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  For the first time looking at her, Seong Jihan felt chills.
 </p>
 <p>
  In her flickering eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  An intense emotion was embedded, to the point that the expression madness was insufficient.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…About 10 percent of that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Quite a lot survived, right? Of course.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Pythia touched, the screen changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  There, a scene of Gilgamesh clicking his tongue next to the test tube appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ha, why is the survival rate so low? Useless things. The field is the problem.]
 </p>
 <p>
  An appearance only caring about the survival rate rather than death even as his own children burned.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Our Lord Adam wasn’t happy with that, so.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In the screen that changed again, Gilgamesh was pointing his finger at Pythia.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ha… It’s you again?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [This woman is tiresome. Why is her performance so good?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hey. You. What trick did you use? Don’t just keep the good stuff to yourself, share it. Let my concubines eat the fruit of life too… You don’t know? Ha. You think I’ll favor you for doing that?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ah, her again? Can’t you get rid of her? She really clings.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “He only said bullshit like this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan quietly watched this and said one thing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can I step on that guy too?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wh-What? W-We’re allies…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bam!
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan kicked in the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh’s head exploded again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh’s skull, exploding and destroying the space.
 </p>
 <p>
  Regenerated slower compared to when Pythia stepped on it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Having someone else step on him, I feel a bit relieved.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Clap clap.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia, who was clapping her hands happily seeing that sight.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, shall we get to the main point now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  She began emitting intense cold energy from her whole body.

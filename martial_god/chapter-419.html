  Chapter 419
 </p>
 <p>
  “Getting to the main point… What do you intend to talk about?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan watched Pythia gather her power, he adjusted himself accordingly.
 </p>
 <p>
  His fractured face and burning right arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  The combined power of the void and the red energy was strengthening him, putting him in a combat-ready state.
 </p>
 <p>
  “As expected, you are strong.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  As she activated her divine eye while observing Seong Jihan gather his power, Pythia continued speaking while trampling on Gilgamesh once again.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You can’t even compare to this guy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Comparing us itself is an insult.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Indeed. Sorry about that. Instead, would you like to hear something interesting?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What is it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you know why the Blood clan carried out such prolific breeding?”𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  The reason the Blood clan used Gilgamesh to propagate a new breed of humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was well-aware of it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wasn’t it to infiltrate humanity with the Red Administrator?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How did you know? I intended to say that!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Because I have this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan pointed to his right arm, Pythia nodded understandingly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator’s hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, it was natural to be aware of the truth surrounding human origins.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Didn’t you learn that before from Yggdrasil’s hints?]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Just go along with it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [Got it.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Hand responded immediately to Seong Jihan’s remark.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it’s this obedient, it shouldn’t have asked in the first place.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan was thinking that, Pythia continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, this should be easy to understand. If humanity is the host for the Red Administrator… In the end, who do you think will be the Administrator?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No idea.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It would naturally be Gilgamesh as the top priority. No matter how incompetent and greedy he is… He has sown the most seeds.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Him?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan pointed downward with his finger.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh lifted his head again, a mangled smile on his face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha, haha! Humans… were they truly the host of the Red Administrator? Those crazy bastards… I never knew!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh had never understood why he alone was told to sow seeds up until now.
 </p>
 <p>
  He realized it was to conceal the Red Administrator within humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nevertheless… Even so, what she says makes sense. If indeed humanity becomes the Red Administrator, I would naturally take the central role!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Modern humanity is descended from Gilgamesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even while being subjugated by Pythia, Gilgamesh was certain of this and seemed pleased.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crunch.
 </p>
 <p>
  And Pythia, glaring disdainfully, stomped Gilgamesh down again.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mm…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Yes. I can’t accept this man becoming the Red Administrator. So, I’ll shatter the game board.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hearing about shattering the game board made the red eye embedded in Seong Jihan’s right hand glimmer.
 </p>
 <p>
  From it, a voice emerged.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Incorrect.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Did your hand just speak?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Correct. I spoke. The statement you made earlier is wrong. The Red Administrator will be the main body.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “The main body? By that, do you mean… is it Seong Jihan?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Indeed. The stud has served its purpose.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “How can I believe that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [A reproductive organ can’t become the ruler of the body.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What… Did you just call me a reproductive organ!?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Flaring up, Gilgamesh raised his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  [What else is a seed-sowing organ if not a reproductive tool? You served your purpose by helping humanity flourish. you can’t even produce kids anymore.]
 </p>
 <p>
  At the words of the Red Hand, Gilgamesh flinched momentarily.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That… That may be true, but… I fathered children here. If we restore the laboratory, I can have children again…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Incorrect. You’re sterile.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, I’m not!!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Red Hand said that, Gilgamesh became more hysterical than ever.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Being called sterile hit him harder than being subdued by Pythia.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Crunch! Crunch!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Get back in there. Seriously.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia kept stomping on Gilgamesh as he crazily raised his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, his resistance was intense.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I-I’m not sterile! It functions well! I just can’t seem to conceive…! Yes, here in the laboratory, it will be possible again! I’ll have descendants, my offsprings!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Impossible.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “D-Damn it… Then, could I conceive if I became the Administrator?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The reproductive organ can’t become the brain.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so? Men do often entrust their brains to that part.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Sexist comment.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, I’m sorry. It’s just that Gilgamesh left me with too many scars.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia bowed her head briefly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike the earlier smiling expression, she looked truly delighted at the thought of Gilgamesh being sterile.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well… If Seong Jihan were to become the Red Administrator, I wouldn’t mind. He might be my offspring.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just like Gilgamesh wanted to be called ‘Father’, you want to be called ‘Mother’?”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Ugh, no. I don’t wish to speak like him. And…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash…!
 </p>
 <p>
  A bright halo formed from light shone on Pythia’s forehead.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you were my son, I wouldn’t be able to kill you, correct?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The eye formed of light, the divine eye, appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the same time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ice swords began to materialize one by one from the surrounding cold air.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  “The divine eye and ice sword rain… So, you intend to fight to the end.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I owe Martial God for saving me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whatever Martial God’s ulterior motive was.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having rescued her from the hell of giving birth to 7,342 children, she could indeed see it as grace.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘She subdued Gilgamesh, so I’ll also have to go all out.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With that thought, Seong Jihan set up his BattleTube channel to get his star buff.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh, is he finally starting his Challenger game?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Hmm… Doesn’t look like the game map again.
 </p>
 <p>
  -What’s with those red eyes everywhere lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow… That woman’s pretty.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But she seems feisty. She’s stomping on some old guy?
 </p>
 <p>
  -I get uneasy if it’s not in-game… -_-
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers quickly sensed the unusual atmosphere as soon as they logged into the broadcast, and were worried about what new trouble Seong Jihan had landed into.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, Pythia glanced at the air and smiled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You turned on the broadcast. I got a notification too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I need the buff. I can’t afford to hold back against Eve who trampled Adam.”
 </p>
 <p>
  -Huh? Adam and Eve… For real?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Eve’s too good for that middle-aged man.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But stomped or not, isn’t it too much? The old guy’s face got utterly wrecked…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Does that mean this place is Eden? lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -With all those eyes? What blasphemy.
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as Seong Jihan dropped his clue, the chat buzzed about the biblical reference to Adam and Eve, igniting the discussion regardless of the viewer’s faith.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, stop calling me Eve! I don’t want to be linked with this man.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  As Pythia extended her hand, the ice swords simultaneously fired at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  It appeared to be a light attack to probe the opponent, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Strong.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It must have been the power of a Sovereign constellation at work.
 </p>
 <p>
  Certainly, the might contained in the swords was formidable.
 </p>
 <p>
  If Seong Jihan had faced these attacks before attaining the power of both void and red.
 </p>
 <p>
  It would have been quite challenging to counter these attacks.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, flame.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Got it, main body.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s right arm blazed with red flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  The mighty authority of the red, now even more powerful after grafting a red arm, possessed the ability to evaporate the ice swords into vapor instantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  The ice swords vanished without being able to breach the wall of flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing this, Pythia nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your hand listens well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So far, yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “In this case, I am completely at a disadvantage concerning the power of fire…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia created a momentary white flame in her hand and extinguished it again.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The sacred flame, taken from Sophia?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. I retrieved it as it became necessary, but it won’t work on you, will it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why not test it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No need to test an inevitable result. Ah, this doesn’t look good… The affinity is too poor. My ice can’t penetrate your authority, and…”
 </p>
 <p>
  With just a single probing attack sequence, Pythia perfectly analyzed the gap between her and Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her power was formidable, but completely outmatched by the authority of the red.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have no choice. Even as a sovereign constellation, I’ll have to rely on this facility’s power.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Clap!
 </p>
 <p>
  As Pythia clapped her hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  The dormant red eyes within the laboratory regained vitality.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bzzz…
 </p>
 <p>
  The eyes fired red lasers in unison.
 </p>
 <p>
  The beams appeared as if they’d incinerate anything they touched.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, the space surrounding Seong Jihan was entirely under his control, causing the beams to halt midway before reaching him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘These lasers even push back the void-dominated space.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Bzzzz…
 </p>
 <p>
  The red lasers didn’t stop entirely.
 </p>
 <p>
  Slowly extending toward Seong Jihan’s domain.
 </p>
 <p>
  Simultaneously.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish! Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  Ice swords rained down upon Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike the light probing attack from earlier, this time, they came at him with full force.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How about this? It’ll be hard to block, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  With the eye’s laser beams and the ice swords working together.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Though the two did not mix, they systematically pressured Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Regardless of the poor affinity of her power against Seong Jihan’s, this level of coordinated attack…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll have to summon the void as well.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Sssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  As a violet fog began to arise from Seong Jihan’s cracked face.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Hand urgently spoke to him.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Main body! No need for that. We’ve conquered half the space already.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ”…Already?“
 </p>
 <p>
  [All Red authority belongs to the main body. This clan’s laboratory cannot defy fate.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really? Can you control those lasers too?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Naturally.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Bzz…
 </p>
 <p>
  At his words, the red lasers immediately changed direction.
 </p>
 <p>
  The beams that were piercing toward Seong Jihan instantly incinerated the ice swords and pivoted toward Pythia.
 </p>
 <p>
  She narrowly dodged them and spoke slowly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ”…An outsider seized mastery over this place in an instant. You might indeed become the Red Administrator.“
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll have to wait and see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan pressed his advantage, now turning the pressure back on Pythia.
 </p>
 <p>
  The red eyes in the lab quickly began following his commands, firing lasers at Pythia.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  Her divine eye shone, narrowly dodging each attack.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is… The odds of winning are already gone. Really hurts my pride as a constellation!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia admitted defeat, even while her divine eye evaded the attacks by a hair’s breadth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Those red lasers are good. I like them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Main body, I can do better. That’s a lower version of ultimate Red authority, Total Annihilation.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Total Annihilation? You should’ve told me sooner.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You didn’t ask.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Tch. Valuable things should be offered voluntarily.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […Got it.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s try it out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Obeying Seong Jihan’s command, the Red Hand ignited.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the red eye glimmered, channeling the stat of ‘Red.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Red:
 </p>
 <p>
  Total Annihilation.
 </p>
 <p>
  The red light filled the entire laboratory’s front.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon, the world blazed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The fire engulfed everything, even itself, consuming it all as it vanished.
 </p>
 <p>
  -…This is a different level from those other laser eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow, it scorched everything in a straight line.
 </p>
 <p>
  -So, this is the Administrator’s hand?
 </p>
 <p>
  Total Annihilation, which incinerated everything indiscriminately.
 </p>
 <p>
  This level of power was probably second only to the Taiji Sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stat Red decreased by 3.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Using Total Annihilation cost stat points.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’ll be useful against formidable opponents later.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Satisfied with the overwhelming power of Total Annihilation, Seong Jihan looked ahead.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia and Gilgamesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the tree had all completely vanished from the front.
 </p>
 <p>
  Was it too powerful?
 </p>
 <p>
  “So Adam and Eve both perished like this…”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan muttered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, we’re not dead yet?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwooosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Ice formed in mid-air, revealing a slightly scorched Pythia.
 </p>
 <p>
  And a completely charred Gilgamesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Judging by the looks of things, Gilgamesh had served as her shield.
 </p>
 <p>
  “And how many times have I told you to stop calling me Eve?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, Pythia. You dodged that, huh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wouldn’t have survived without the divine eye.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the glowing eye on Pythia’s forehead.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Divine eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  While his sister’s barely had any worthwhile functions, Pythia put it to good use.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I really can’t win against you… No matter how much I use the divine eye, I see no path to victory.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you surrendering quietly, then?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, you really intend to kill me? Don’t you feel pity?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Pity… I do feel an ounce of human empathy… But I can’t let you destroy humanity.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s words, Pythia smirked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I figured as much. I would have been disappointed if you had shown leniency. Mixing business with personal feelings is unwise.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really? Then prepare to die.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as Seong Jihan drew his sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia smiled cryptically.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But… Why do you think I have blabbered on about my tragic past to stretch for time?”
 </p>
 <p>
  ”…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It was all for this moment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack!
 </p>
 <p>
  Behind Pythia, space tore apart.
 </p>
 <p>
  A massive hand emerged.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s head to Tuseong. Martial God is waiting.”

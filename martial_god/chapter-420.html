  Chapter 420
 </p>
 <p>
  A massive black hand, large enough to grab dozens of people.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan had seen this before.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Dongbang Sak tried to explode that when he was advancing the Nine Palaces Eight Trigrams.‘
 </p>
 <p>
  That was in the game world. But now, it’s real life.
 </p>
 <p>
  Entering reality, is he directly intervening?
 </p>
 <p>
  Even so.
 </p>
 <p>
  “He dares to touch a Constellation candidate himself? the Martial God isn’t afraid of penalties, it seems.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not at all. Until now, he couldn’t move freely due to those penalties. But…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia’s gaze shifted to Seong Jihan’s right arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The moment you grafted the Red Administrator’s hand, the situation changed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This thing?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, once he secures you and absorbs that arm, my lord can achieve his goal. Enduring some penalties is a small price for that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia sidestepped.
 </p>
 <p>
  Allowing the menacing black hand to strike.
 </p>
 <p>
  The power contained was significant.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Damn… it’s bad. Using Total Annihilation again requires some cooldown. Should’ve used it sparingly.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Hand seemed flustered, but Seong Jihan’s expression remained calm.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s fine. I have another countermeasure.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  A Taiji symbol appeared behind him.
 </p>
 <p>
  The energy of the void amplified in his fractured face.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instantly, his left hand, covered in void energy, manifested a dark sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan placed it within the Taiji.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Are you seriously going to use the Taiji Sword? There’s no time for that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “My power has recently increased, you see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  The fractures starting from his chin widened.
 </p>
 <p>
  The intense void energy engulfed Seong Jihan’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  Simultaneously, the dark sword Eclipse emerged from the Taiji.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike its previous smaller size, the dark sword adopted its original longsword form.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait… how did you do that already…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even before the Martial God’s hand could touch him, the second stage of the Taiji Sword was complete.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia blinked in disbelief.
 </p>
 <p>
  Such speed typically required practice similar to Dongbang Sak’s level of expertise.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He’s just mimicking?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering the rapid emergence of the taiji sword, Pythia thought so.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sword moved gracefully, slashing the Martial God’s hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  The overpowering dark hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Effortlessly split apart.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Did it seriously slice through?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s just one hand, not the Martial God himself.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Shiiii…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The sword’s trajectory tore space.
 </p>
 <p>
  Engulfing the Martial God’s entire hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  The hand crumbled, disappearing as soon as it was summoned.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Came in grand, but got cut down in a minute, lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  -The Martial God’s name sounds scary, but he’s nothing special?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Couldn’t we just follow the hand and take down the main body?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Seeing how strong Seong Jihan has become, maybe…?
 </p>
 <p>
  -He got the Administrator’s hand; beating the Martial God should be easy, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan effortlessly destroyed the Martial God’s hand, human viewers thought the Martial God might not be as formidable.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile.
 </p>
 <p>
  -That red beam, was it Total Annihilation?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yeah, exactly. The main attack used by the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  -So, having the Administrator’s hand means you can use Total Annihilation? It’s incredibly valuable.
 </p>
 <p>
  Alien viewers focused on the Total Annihilation Seong Jihan used.
 </p>
 <p>
  The red beam, the Red Administrator’s primary attack.
 </p>
 <p>
  The overwhelming destructive power of Total Annihilation was synonymous with the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  Merely obtaining the hand and using it right away…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Great constellations will likely target Earth even more after seeing this.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Even so, Seong Jihan can’t be beaten unless you’re a great constellation.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Right. Lesser constellations would be overwhelmed by Total Annihilation.
 </p>
 <p>
  -That woman couldn’t even resist properly, and she’s level 8 sovereign constellation.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Instead of trying to possess the hand, it’s better to locate the planet and sell the info to a great constellation… could earn a good amount GP.
 </p>
 <p>
  Today’s video indicated that great constellations would now covet the Administrator’s hand even more.
 </p>
 <p>
  The appearance of Total Annihilation made a significant impact.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm… didn’t expect the Red eye laser to draw this much attention.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Though Total Annihilation is powerful, it’s inferior to the Taiji Sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  To avoid great constellations invading Earth, he needed a way to control this.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan pondered while glancing at the chat from alien viewers, then shifted his focus.
 </p>
 <p>
  There, Pythia stood, using the charred Gilgamesh as her shield.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who are you…? Why have you become so strong?”
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  “Who knows. But it seems, Tuseong is out of reach.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pointing the sword at Pythia, Seong Jihan saw her frown.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…If you can summon the Taiji Sword, couldn’t you have just gone earlier?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’d rather go on my own terms, not be dragged there.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Meticulous, aren’t you…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Only when I eliminate you too can it be called meticulous.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Before finishing his sentence, Seong Jihan dashed towards Pythia.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though Total Annihilation didn’t finish her, the Taiji Sword should.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m not ready to die just yet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  She jumped with Gilgamesh into the rift created by the Martial God’s hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  The spatial crack closed instantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you really want to kill me, come here~”
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the rift, Pythia smirked and gestured to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Challenging him to follow her to kill her.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Tsk.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Clicking his tongue, Seong Jihan threw the Taiji Sword at the rift.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the crack vanished faster than the blade could reach.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Eve slipped away… -_-
 </p>
 <p>
  -Leaving her alive means endless trouble.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But he couldn’t just follow into that rift.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But isn’t Eve humanity’s mother? Why is he so bent on killing her?
 </p>
 <p>
  -She said she wasn’t Eve herself, remember? lol
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing Pythia escape successfully, viewers regretted not being able to capture a troublesome opponent.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned, staring at the spot where Pythia vanished.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Was it the Divine eye? Her responses were quicker than normal opponents.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the Martial God’s four disciples, Dongbang Sak and Ashoka seemed to have their own agendas.
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh, despite being unhelpful, harbored intense resentment towards the Martial God due to a fraudulent contract.
 </p>
 <p>
  Only Pythia remained truly loyal to him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eliminating her was crucial this time, it’s unfortunate.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This ends today’s broadcast.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan retracted his power and turned off BattleTube.
 </p>
 <p>
  Traveling to the northern island of Australia felt somewhat lacking.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he scanned the surroundings again.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Hand made a suggestion.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Main body, should we fully control this laboratory?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is there anything valuable here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Appears to be.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well? Let’s gather whatever we can.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Since Pythia escaped, might as well collect something.
 </p>
 <p>
  With Seong Jihan’s permission, the red eye began to glow.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  On the Martial God’s star, Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I apologize, my lord. I couldn’t fulfill the command.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia, who had fled in haste, knelt before the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Not at all. Seong Jihan’s strength was beyond expectation. You carried out your mission well.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you for your grace.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Though she failed to bring Seong Jihan to Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia did what she could.
 </p>
 <p>
  Creating the rift to connect Tuseong and allowing the Martial God’s hand to intervene.
 </p>
 <p>
  The failure to drag Seong Jihan through was due to the Martial God’s hand being overpowered by the Taiji Sword, not her fault.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  the Martial God regenerated his arm, destroyed on Earth.
 </p>
 <p>
  He looked at Dongbang Sak, standing respectfully below the throne.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dongbang Sak, how could he wield the Taiji Sword so proficiently?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I’m unsure. However, his sword seemed different from mine. Given it carries void energy, it seems he realized the Taiji sword differently.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Find a way to neutralize it.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Dongbang Sak deeply bowed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God’s gaze shifted to Gilgamesh, lying sprawled by Pythia’s side.
 </p>
 <p>
  [How does it feel to realize you were merely bait, Gilgamesh?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You… you bastard… Do you mean to break our contract?!“
 </p>
 <p>
  [Contract… Do you still not realize its futility?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Grr…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gnashing his teeth, Gilgamesh asked the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, the promise that I could see my descendants in the laboratory… was a lie, wasn’t it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Does it matter?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…It matters to me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Red Hand spoke the truth.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “No… impossible! You’re lying, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Such trivial things are not worth lying about.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “No… No…”
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  The Martial God’s affirmation left Gilgamesh muttering in confusion.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He was so keen on sowing seeds, and now he talks about wanting descendants?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing Gilgamesh, Pythia looked at him with disgust.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God gestured.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dongbang Sak, remove him.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shall I kill him?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [No. Let him live. He might be of use later.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  At Dongbang Sak’s single step, Gilgamesh floated in the air and was quickly led away.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shocked by the news that he couldn’t have descendants, Gilgamesh didn’t resist and was taken away quietly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God watched them leave briefly, then.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Dark energy surged from his face, activating the Divine eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Pythia, activate your Divine eye as well. We need to foresee.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Following the Martial God’s command, Pythia activated the Divine eye on her forehead.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bzzzzz…
 </p>
 <p>
  The two eyes synchronized, generating a larger white sphere of light between them.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Will Seong Jihan become a variable that hinders my grand plan?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash! Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Martial God spoke, the white sphere began to foresee.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bzzzzz…
 </p>
 <p>
  Numerous screens appeared and disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Observing alongside the Martial God, Pythia frowned gravely.
 </p>
 <p>
  ”…He certainly becomes a variable.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, having grown enormously in strength after grafting the Administrator’s hand and merging the void processor into his face.
 </p>
 <p>
  The foresight measured his chance of victory at 5%.
 </p>
 <p>
  An outsider might see this as merely 5%.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…The lord doesn’t tolerate even a 0.1% variable. He’s never faced such a scenario before. But now, 5%… Seong Jihan has grown excessively.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The result was shocking to Pythia.
 </p>
 <p>
  […Change the question.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God’s eyes turned skyward.
 </p>
 <p>
  Above Tuseong, countless relics sparkled like stars.
 </p>
 <p>
  He pointed at them.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Would using 30% of the relic’s power eliminate the variable?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash…
 </p>
 <p>
  The white sphere dimmed slightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The frequency of screens diminished significantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Still some…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the artifacts, there were instances where Seong Jihan emerged victorious.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing this, the Martial God’s eyes glowed red.
 </p>
 <p>
  [50%…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Even at 50%.
 </p>
 <p>
  [70%…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Even at 70%.
 </p>
 <p>
  Faint as it was, the white sphere still glimmered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Indicating a future where Seong Jihan could win.
 </p>
 <p>
  the Martial God’s voice deepened ominously.
 </p>
 <p>
  […What if all the power is used?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering the ultimate scenario.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash…
 </p>
 <p>
  The white sphere showed a single screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This… still exists?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [……]
 </p>
 <p>
  Trembling, Pythia stared at the revealed scene.
 </p>
 <p>
  A scorched Tuseong with a colossal being standing alone.
 </p>
 <p>
  Covered in red eyes, its form resembled the Blood Clan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “L-Lord. But this doesn’t seem like Seong Jihan…”
 </p>
 <p>
  […No, it’s him. He has become the Red Administrator.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A future where Seong Jihan triumphs and the Martial God falls.
 </p>
 <p>
  It existed only when he transformed into the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then… isn’t this future impossible?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing this, Pythia brightened.
 </p>
 <p>
  [No, it’s inevitable.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Administrator’s hand is within him. He can burn humanity anytime.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “But… He doesn’t seem like someone who would incinerate humanity…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia hesitated.
 </p>
 <p>
  the Martial God’s red eyes glared down at her.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Have you become foolish, hanging around Gilgamesh?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, my lord…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Who would forsake the path to become the Red Administrator?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God was sure.
 </p>
 <p>
  [All he must do is burn one planet and incinerate humanity.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan would choose the “easy path.”Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

  Chapter 422
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, you came so quickly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Don’t tell me you were proceeding with the training room breaking content just to call me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded to the quick-witted arena owner and spoke to the viewers.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Everyone, as soon as I turned on the broadcast he came, now there’s no longer a need to continue the content. Let’s end it here for today.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As he abruptly turned off Battle Tube, the arena owner remarked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not proceeding with the original content just because you achieved your goal… your channel will fail at this rate.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then should I have broken the training room?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Excluding this case, I recommend diligently proceeding with it at other times.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seems like you don’t like it being broken.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Creating a training room that can withstand the Taiji Sword is no ordinary feat.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The arena owner then got to the main point.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, why did you call me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This time, I used Total Annihilation against a constellation…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I saw that too. The authority of the Red Administrator showed itself again after a long time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That video aired just 10 minutes ago… I didn’t expect the 4th in the Void to watch it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s because you’re a person of great interest.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If he watched the broadcast, there’s no need for a long explanation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Since obtaining the Red Hand, the attention has increased even more after using Total Annihilation. At this rate, extraterrestrial beings will invade Earth.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Normally, information about newcomers to the BattleNet league can’t be obtained… but it’s not entirely impossible.”
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s no such thing as perfect security in the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the arena owner said, if information leakage isn’t impossible, they had to prepare for future events assuming it would happen.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I want to avoid a situation where aliens invade Earth to seize the Administrator’s hand. So, I need a stage to fight outside, not on Earth…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You want to receive a battlefield from me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can provide as many fighting locations as you want. However.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  Under the hat, the arena owner’s eyes looked at Seong Jihan’s right arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  “To lure alien players to the battlefield, you need to put up that hand as a prize.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I guess so.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you extract the arm in the current state, it will be quite a blow… Can you handle it? If you’re unlucky, you might die.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Administrator’s Hand immediately gave a negative reaction to these words.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Main body. Don’t overdo it. Even great constellations can’t invade Earth quickly. And if they invade, can’t we just set Earth on fire? Before resources are taken away.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The hand already classified humanity on Earth as a resource to become the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan roughly went along with its perception.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Sacred flame could reclaim resources, but what if we unfortunately suffer a strong preemptive strike? Great constellations should have the ability to deal a devastating blow to a planet.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s true, but still, the penalty is too much.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘To become the Permanent Administrator, we need to take risks. Until humanity evolves, I need to draw their attention.’
 </p>
 <p>
  […Understood. I will follow your will, main body.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Permanent Administrator’, the true goal of the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  When this was mentioned, the Administrator’s Hand obediently followed Seong Jihan’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll participate in person, so provide the battlefield.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood. Then, I will prepare the stage promptly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan’s answer came out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ziiing…
 </p>
 <p>
  The arena owner began setting up a special stage in Space Arena.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The game type is a tournament. It would be best for the winner of the finals to fight against Seong Jihan…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “For the map, proceed based on Space Arena… and participant players should be at least constellations. You’re planning to have great constellations participate too, right? Seong Jihan.”Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. Rather than great constellations invading here, it’s better to fight there.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then if we have great constellations participate… Ah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The screen flashed several times and disappeared. The arena owner, who was proceeding with stage setup, suddenly stopped at one point.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan, we have a problem.”
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  “What’s the problem?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re still in Challenger League -9. To invite great constellations, you need to reach at least Challenger -5.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, it’s because I haven’t played Challenger games yet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After the battle with Taiji’s Lost Soul, while organizing the power he gained then.
 </p>
 <p>
  He hadn’t been able to proceed with Challenger game matching even once.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Raise it right away.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then only up to Level 8 constellations can participate in the 1st tournament.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “With Level 8, the participation rate would be low.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even Pythia, who became a mess with one shot of Total Annihilation, was a Level 8 constellation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Would constellations who saw this case really participate?
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if they came out, they would only be pathetically broken.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well… I’m confident it will be a big hit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They’ll think Pythia was weak, but they’re different.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Beep. Beep beep.
 </p>
 <p>
  The arena owner finished the rough settings and started negotiating the details.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The participation fee for the constellation tournament will be used primarily for battlefield construction.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re charging a participation fee too?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course. With the Red Hand as the prize, we need to receive a participation fee worthy of its value. Seong Jihan, you will also receive a fair share of the related profits. Of course, after first deducting the design cost of the battlefield.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ll be using an existing arena map, so the design cost won’t be much.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No. Maps where high-level constellations will fight need to be newly constructed each time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Then the other party explained complicated stories about why it costs so much, what the profits will be like, fees, and so on.
 </p>
 <p>
  For the 4th in the Void, why is he directly explaining even these things?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I miss Hayeon. If this were guild work, she would have handled it for me.’
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who had left complicated contracts to Lee Hayeon, missed her more and more as the arena owner’s explanation lengthened.
 </p>
 <p>
  Listening with one ear and letting it go with the other ear for unimportant things, he proceeded with the negotiation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Ah, and the tournament reward can be replaced with an evolution bonus.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You can give the reward as a species evolution bonus?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At the end, the arena owner said something he couldn’t ignore.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Main body, it’s an opportunity. Win the tournament and quickly evolve to the intermediate stage!]
 </p>
 <p>
  When they said they would give an evolution bonus, the Red Hand, which had been negative about the tournament, became excited.
 </p>
 <p>
  If humanity evolves to the intermediate stage, burn them all with sacred flame and become the Permanent Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the arena owner with calm eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well… it seems like you’re giving out a lot. Species evolution bonus.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Giving out? You’re putting up the treasure of the Administrator’s hand, you’re just receiving a proper reward. Moreover, Seong Jihan, aren’t you even risking your life?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, think of it as a proper reward.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Proper, he said.
 </p>
 <p>
  From his perspective, it seemed like he was desperate to evolve humanity somehow.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Come to think of it, this hand was also given at the arena…’
 </p>
 <p>
  What was the real purpose of the Void side?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan pondered for a moment, but this wasn’t a question that could be answered right away.
 </p>
 <p>
  For now, the negotiation had to proceed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Okay. I’ll choose the reward when the time comes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Like that, he proceeded with the tournament with his hand at stake.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  The next day.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Did you see the constellation tournament being held at the arena this time? The prize is the Red Hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  -The hand that used Total Annihilation?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Then is Seong Jihan the organizer?
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  -That’s right, he put up his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Huh. What kind of connection does he have with the arena owner? Even the last broadcast…
 </p>
 <p>
  When the notice for ‘Seong Jihan’s 1st Constellation Tournament’ went up on Space Arena.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Battle Net community was abuzz.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is he making a move before the planet’s location is discovered?
 </p>
 <p>
  -But will they stop searching for the location just because of that? They can ignore the tournament and just invade.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Finding the location of humanity’s planet might take longer than the tournament results. It’s not easy to find a beginner’s planet.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since they were all players who had rolled around Battle Net to their hearts’ content, they quickly grasped Seong Jihan’s intentions.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Even if you find the planet, if it’s far from your home planet, getting there is also a problem. The tournament is much better.
 </p>
 <p>
  -That’s right. Before reaching humanity’s planet, the hand’s owner will have changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But the 1st tournament has a Level 8 limit… Wasn’t the constellation swept away by Total Annihilation also Level 8?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Then who would participate? They’d just get beaten up for nothing if they go out.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Registration is already closed, lol. They say the 256-player bracket will be out soon.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Already?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan blinked his eyes after browsing the posts written by alien players on the BattleNet community.
 </p>
 <p>
  It hasn’t been long since the notice went up, and registration is closed?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Isn’t the human race just a lower-grade species anyway? Level 8 of such guys and Level 8 of higher-grade species constellations are different.
 </p>
 <p>
  -That’s right. And it seems easy if you just avoid one shot of Total Annihilation?
 </p>
 <p>
  -That sword he pulled out didn’t seem very powerful either.
 </p>
 <p>
  -With just that tiny thing, what can he do?
 </p>
 <p>
  -In the first place, would Level 8s be scared of Seong Jihan, who’s still just a constellation candidate? Lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Even with the same constellation level, there’s a considerable difference in standards depending on the species’ grade.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan could understand the reason why registration closed quickly by looking at the additional posts coming up on the community.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia being defeated was because of the surprise Total Annihilation and because she was from a lower-grade species, humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  They think it will be different for them.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s how they see it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, I’ll have to judge how much the difference is by watching the matches.’
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan was thinking that.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You there. The arena tournament bracket is out!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A shadow rose from a corner of the living room, and the Shadow Queen displayed a screen to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even if the bracket is out, I’m facing the winner anyway. Do I need to look?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Among the Level 8 constellations, it seems all the famous ones participated? Shouldn’t you prepare in advance?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even if I look, there won’t be any names I know anyway.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In the first place, there weren’t many he knew among the alien constellations.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought he just needed to see who would reach the finals, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  “A name you know…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Shadow Queen scanned through the tournament names.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then pointed to one slot with her finger.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This one, wasn’t he originally from humanity?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh? Who?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ashoka.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…He appeared?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan opened his eyes slightly wide.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka was participating in a tournament with the Red Hand at stake.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, he was a Level 8 constellation, but this was completely unexpected.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  Brrrr…
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s cell phone vibrated.
 </p>
 <p>
  He usually didn’t answer unknown numbers, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…This is the first time I’ve seen one starting with 777 in the front.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The unusual number that came in now seemed like one he should answer.
 </p>
 <p>
  Tap.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he pressed the call button.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Seong Jihan. I have an urgent matter to discuss with you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  From inside, Ashoka’s voice flowed out.

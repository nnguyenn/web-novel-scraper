  Chapter 423
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Ashoka from Tuseong is calling me…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the number calling him again and answered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you also come to Earth?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [No, Tuseong members are all banned from approaching Earth. We got punished with a one-month access ban for touching the constellation candidate.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “One month? That’s not a big penalty.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Normally it’s not, but at a time like this, that one month can be crucial.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, a one-month penalty is too light.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the Martial God knew this earlier, he would have eliminated Seong Jihan long ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Then in one month, an even stronger constellation may come to interfere.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Pythia and Gilgamesh weren’t much of an obstacle, it would be different if Dongbang Sak came.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking that he shouldn’t waste time during this one month, Seong Jihan continued the conversation with Ashoka.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then you’re not calling from Tuseong, are you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [No. If it was Tuseong, I wouldn’t have been able to because of the Martial God’s interference. I’m in the waiting room for players at Space Arena, so I was able to contact you like this.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aha.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It hasn’t been long since the tournament started, but they already gathered the constellations in the waiting room for the round of 256.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So what’s the urgent matter?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [When we face each other in the tournament, use Total Annihilation on me.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Total Annihilation…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I need to know how much you are controlled by the hand.]
 </p>
 <p>
  He thought Seong Jihan would use it just because he said so?
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you say it like that, I don’t feel like using it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have to use it. Otherwise, I may turn back time.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What do you mean turn back time?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It means I will fully support the Martial God’s return.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned at those words.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you threatening me now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [No. I intend to fully support you. However, I cannot support Seong Jihan who has become the Red Administrator.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Why?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Because that means the extinction of mankind.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Extinction, huh.
 </p>
 <p>
  To become the Red Administrator, humanity must be burned as sacred flame, so Ashoka’s words are correct.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I have no intention of setting the fire though.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan wanted to immediately confirm that he had no such intention.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Becoming the Red Administrator is not extinction. It is the final stage of human evolution and the proper conclusion. How is it extinction for 7 billion to become one absolute being?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Administrator’s Hand, who seemed to have heard Ashoka’s call, was sending a message to him.
 </p>
 <p>
  The hand that still couldn’t be perfectly controlled.
 </p>
 <p>
  In front of it, he couldn’t say he wouldn’t become the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  Until he found a way to control this powerful bomb, he had to act as if coveting the Administrator position.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright for now. I’ll use Total Annihilation. But… to receive it from me, you have to win the tournament first, don’t you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You don’t have to worry about that. The championship is certain.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s quite a confidence.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’ll see when the time comes.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the Level 8 constellations who decided to participate.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was only one constellation from a lower race.
 </p>
 <p>
  Most were from at least middle to upper races, with the majority from upper races.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka was calmly saying that he would naturally beat them and rise from the round of 256 to the very top.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Based on when he turned the Golden Wheel last time, he doesn’t seem easy…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Although not at Dongbang Sak’s level, he seemed to be above Pythia.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought he should also gauge his strength this time and replied.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay. If you make it up, I’ll shoot Total Annihilation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Got it. Then until then, I hope you don’t get dominated by the hand.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Beep.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka hung up after saying that.
 </p>
 <p>
  The vibe was like he would turn back time right away if Seong Jihan got dominated by the hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  [How arrogant for a mere Level 8.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, he’s a constellation with some skill.”
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan was responding to the grumbling Red Hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Shadow Queen, who heard the conversation next to him, was staring at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Could you possibly become the Administrator?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who knows.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We should get close then. Can I go back into the sword?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why now? You took off when using the Taeguk Demon Sword.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Still, connecting with the Administrator is more important.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Her intentions are transparent.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan smiled.

 <p>
  “There’s no need to specially take care of you, so just act normal.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How cold. Then I’ll have to work hard again from the bottom…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What bottom. You gathered quite a few sponsors despite that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right now, the expenses are higher than the earnings from sponsors. I think it will turn a profit in 1-2 years…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But what’s the problem?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Shadow Queen glanced at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Will it still be okay here in 1-2 years?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Like the last clash, this world seems like it could explode at any moment. The changes are too fast.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It makes sense to think that way.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the first place, they officially entered the Space League this year.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not even a year has passed, but all sorts of things happened, so she must be wondering if it’s okay to keep investing here.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But it’s not like you can invest anywhere else.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh… That’s true, but.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then just accept it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Phew… Then, can I do some broadcasts separately?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Broadcasts?”
 </p>
 <p>
  In response to Seong Jihan’s question, the Shadow Queen tapped on the tournament bracket she had brought up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Humanity still can’t broadcast this match.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So you’re going to do it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Besides this, I’m thinking of selecting BattleTube videos from space that humanity is interested in and broadcasting them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… The only ones who can broadcast space BattleTube on Earth are you and me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your sister is capable too. Of course, Seong Jiah said she won’t do that kind of thing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ah, right. Since sister is still a constellation, she’s capable too.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan slowly nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay. Do as you please. I won’t interfere.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh… Really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Before this year ends, many things will likely be settled, so there’s no need to pay attention to such a local broadcast.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan readily allowed it, the Shadow Queen’s face brightened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then I’ll go open the Queen’s channel right away!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should steadily proceed with Challenger games from now on.’
 </p>
 <p>
  After being promoted to the Challenger League, Seong Jihan matched for a regular game for the first time.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  3 days later.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Promoted to Challenger League 8.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘League promotion, I just need to win 3 times.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the system message with an indifferent face.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Challenger League.
 </p>
 <p>
  The strongest in the universe were indeed lined up in this highest league of BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s nothing much.’
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how strong the constellation candidates were.
 </p>
 <p>
  For Seong Jihan, who easily chased away even Level 8 constellations, there was no one who could rival him.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Challenger games are nothing special either.
 </p>
 <p>
  -It’s the familiar massacre scene no matter which league you go to, lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Well, he crushed even Level 8 constellations, so how much more so for other players.
 </p>
 <p>
  -I think Seong Jihan’s regular game matching will end this easily for life.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Probably, lol. It’s fun to see him one-sidedly beating them.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But it’s getting shorter, so it’s a bit disappointing… Today it ended in 1 minute.
 </p>
 <p>
  -For real, when I came in, it was already over, lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as the game started, there were flashes, and the enemies were all sliced up.
 </p>
 <p>
  The regular game matching ended at ultra-high speed like that every day.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I knew it would end this quickly, I should have turned it earlier.’
 </p>
 <p>
  After transplanting the Red Hand and the Void Processor, he had been figuring them out instead of turning regular game matching.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  If he knew he could end it in 1 minute like this, he should have matched in advance whenever he had time.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan regretted the past while coming out to the living room.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’re done already?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, sis.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jiah, who was floating in front of the sofa in a stone statue form, greeted him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing her who couldn’t even sit because she was heavy and was always levitating, Seong Jihan frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t that uncomfortable? Hurry and use the key to turn back into a human.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Wait a bit. I have my own thoughts too.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Geez. I went through so much trouble to get the key, but it’s unrewarding. Seriously.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I have to support Seah until the Beginner’s Arena ends.]
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  “It starts today, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Beginner’s Arena.
 </p>
 <p>
  This event that gathered races who haven’t reached the intermediate level and gave them evolution bonuses was rumored to have been held by the arena owner to give even more evolution bonuses to humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  -The arena owner and Seong Jihan definitely have a connection. They appeared together on Seong Jihan’s broadcast last time too, in the Void Training Room.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Sigh… What the heck is humanity that they’re pushed like that?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Humanity doesn’t seem to particularly have anything, but one person is outstandingly dominant.
 </p>
 <p>
  -No, that’s not quite it. Having three high-level sovereign constellations is one thing… I heard the Cosmic Demon is also human?
 </p>
 <p>
  -The Cosmic Demon… That monster was human too?
 </p>
 <p>
  -The race is just average or below, but exceptionally outstanding players occasionally pop out.
 </p>
 <p>
  While there was a heated debate in the BattleNet community for a while about what humanity was like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Jihan. I think it’s about to start.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Beginner’s Arena was starting on TV.
 </p>
 <p>
  =The Beginner’s Arena. It’s finally starting!
 </p>
 <p>
  =The first opening match will be played between players belonging to the Master League.
 </p>
 <p>
  =The Master League… With current humanity, 5 people can participate!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Yes. The members who played in the promotion match in September will participate in the arena as is!
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps because the evolution of humanity was at stake, the Beginner’s Arena was broadcast live on channel 0 worldwide.
 </p>
 <p>
  =The opposing race this time is… bears?
 </p>
 <p>
  =With so many huge races, bears seem like manageable opponents!
 </p>
 <p>
  The bear-like race summoned on the opposing side in the arena’s stadium.
 </p>
 <p>
  They charged at the human team while actively pressuring them.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah, player Yoon Sejin! He steps forward to block them, but he can’t block all five!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Player Yoon Seah is going in for cover. Does the undead buff work here too?!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Oh, it seems to work! As if there’s one more warrior, she’s actively dealing with them! The opponent’s charge is stopped for now!
 </p>
 <p>
  As Yoon Seah stepped forward like a warrior, Seong Jihan tilted his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh? I didn’t use the Blessing of Undead.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I did it instead.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Was it because she was maintaining the Witch of the Void form that she could give Blessing of Undead like this?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded and said to her.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is your support, sis?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. You need to get a lot of evolution bonuses, right? And Yoon Sejin isn’t fully doing his part as a warrior. I have to give buffs so our daughter doesn’t get hurt.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “There are too few warriors. It’ll be hard for brother-in-law to cover alone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [He’s not brother-in-law anymore.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, got it. Yoon Sejin.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan corrected the way he addressed him, he looked at the progress of the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  The bear race consisting of 5 warriors had their charge blocked, so they were gradually being pushed back by the human team receiving rear support.
 </p>
 <p>
  If Yoon Seah didn’t have the Blessing of Undead, the human team would have been suppressed instead.
 </p>
 <p>
  But because of the archer who threw herself like other tanks to defend the team, the game was easily resolved.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If Seah’s Blessing of Undead works here too, we can expect quite good results.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Sister’s support was definitely reliable.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan was thinking that and watching the victorious humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jihan.. Are you busy right now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Shadow Queen urgently asked Seong Jihan from the floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, I’m watching this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so? The outcome is decided. Then, for a moment… could you show your face on my channel?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Go on your channel? What broadcast are you trying to do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s the round of 256 broadcast of the tournament with your hand as the prize.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ah, that was happening at the same time today too?
 </p>
 <p>
  What schedule did Space Arena set up like this?
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan was thinking that, the Shadow Queen rambled on lamenting.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I thought the confrontation between constellations would get high attention, but the viewer count is much lower than expected. I overlooked that the Beginner’s Arena would be much more popular with humanity…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So you’re telling me to broadcast the tournament?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, no. If you could just show your face once… Right now is the perfect timing for the human constellation’s match.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ashoka? Alright. Let’s go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh… thank you. This way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If Ashoka is appearing, he should watch it once.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan agreed, the Shadow Queen quickly guided him to the floor she popped out from.
 </p>
 <p>
  Stepping on the place full of shadow energy, Seong Jihan’s body was sucked down.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  And the environment changed in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now, I brought a big guest today!”
 </p>
 <p>
  In that place full of only dark shadow energy with several screens open.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka’s appearance was shown on the biggest screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hello everyone. This is Seong Jihan, who is participating as a surprise guest commentator today.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan greeted and tried to give even one line of commentary while looking at the screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as light burst out from the screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Oh, the game ended?”𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  With Ashoka’s opponent gone.
 </p>
 <p>
  The round of 256 ended in an instant.

  Chapter 426
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  As promised, Seong Jihan reached out his right hand towards Ashoka to use Total Annihilation.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do you really have to use Total Annihilation on him?]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Why?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Administrator’s hand that had to shoot the laser didn’t immediately follow the order.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I have a bad feeling about this. I feel like he will ruin our grand endeavor.]
 </p>
 <p>
  If ‘our grand endeavor’ referred to becoming the Red Administrator, it would be good if that got ruined.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he thought like that, Seong Jihan ordered the Administrator’s hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s fine. My intuition says it’s okay. Just shoot.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [But…]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Listen to me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’ll regret it. Definitely.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Hand grumbled like that but eventually focused its power into one place.
 </p>
 <p>
  Red:
 </p>
 <p>
  Total Annihilation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Zing…!
 </p>
 <p>
  A red light burst forward, and an intense beam of light instantly enveloped Ashoka.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a powerful blow that even Pythia barely blocked using Gilgamesh as a shield.
 </p>
 <p>
  Total Annihilation was Seong Jihan’s most powerful means of attack aside from the Taiji Sword, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You condensed the red’s power well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka received the red light attack with one hand, maintaining a serene expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  -No, what is this?
 </p>
 <p>
  -They’re both Level 8 constellations, but the difference between him and Eve is like heaven and earth.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Should we search more about Siddhartha?
 </p>
 <p>
  -I already tried, but there’s not much that comes up.
 </p>
 <p>
  While people were once again raising questions about Ashoka, who blocked Total Annihilation too easily.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s take a proper look.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  Behind Ashoka, a wheel made of skulls.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Golden Wheel rose.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thousand Hands Thousand Eyes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash.
 </p>
 <p>
  Light flickered in the eyes of the skulls within the wheel.
 </p>
 <p>
  Chiiiik!
 </p>
 <p>
  From the red wheel, dark red shadows spread in all directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  The shadow branches, totaling 1,000.
 </p>
 <p>
  After expanding to a certain extent, they all poured towards Total Annihilation at once.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hand…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack!
 </p>
 <p>
  All thousand shadows transformed into hand shapes and grasped the beam of Total Annihilation at once.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is completely blocked. I feel like the power of Total Annihilation is being thoroughly decomposed.’
 </p>
 <p>
  What kind of Level 8 is this strong?
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan was thinking that, the Administrator’s hand was making more of a fuss.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Crazy…! What did I say! I said it was ominous!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “No. You haven’t used your full power yet, right? Use more. Red.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Got it. I’ll draw out more power!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Papapat!
 </p>
 <p>
  Energy surged again from Total Annihilation that was caught by the shadows.
 </p>
 <p>
  As some of the 1,000 fell off here.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You still had some leeway left. You should have used your full power.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka advised Seong Jihan and closed and opened his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  Light spheres rose from the thousand shadows at once.
 </p>
 <p>
  The light spheres that seemed to illuminate the shadows while coexisting strangely with each other.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That somehow looks similar to the Divine Eye.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It had an appearance very similar to the Divine Eye summoned by Pythia or Seong Jiah.
 </p>
 <p>
  And as those spheres rose.
 </p>
 <p>
  Psssh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The enhanced Total Annihilation was decomposing much faster than before.
 </p>
 <p>
  -How is that constellation so strong;
 </p>
 <p>
  -Thousand Hands Thousand Eyes… Doesn’t it mean Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva?
 </p>
 <p>
  -I guess it’s related to Buddhism, that person?
 </p>
 <p>
  -No, but it looks too ominous to be Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva.
 </p>
 <p>
  -For real, those shadows look like the hands of a demon.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Thousand Hands Thousand Eyes that looked too ominous to be Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva’s.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, its power was certain.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even Total Annihilation at full power couldn’t penetrate it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to find a way to deal with that authority.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Turning back time seemed like it could be dealt with by using Return of the Light on this side as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the Thousand Hands Thousand Eyes was different.
 </p>
 <p>
  The thousand arms and eyes were powerful enough to instantly decompose and analyze Total Annihilation.
 </p>
 <p>
  If a situation arose where he had to fight against him, he needed to find a way to overcome that.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Main Body! This guy knows too well about the red’s power…! A different form of power. You have to use the void, the void!]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Didn’t you warn me against the void?’
 </p>
 <p>
  [Now is not the time to be so leisurely!]
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s true.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…
 </p>

 <p>
  Seong Jihan drew out the power of the void from his face.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Ashoka wasn’t such a hostile constellation, he couldn’t be helplessly overpowered like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Cut the thousand hands with the sword of the void. So that I don’t overwhelm you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka’s voice resonated in Seong Jihan’s mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  An opponent who clearly conveyed his meaning without moving his lips at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…He definitely doesn’t seem hostile.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Shuu…
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan summoned the dark sword Eclipse and filled it with the energy of the void.
 </p>
 <p>
  And as he lightly swung a single slash.
 </p>
 <p>
  Chwaaak!
 </p>
 <p>
  The shadow of the thousand hands that easily suppressed Total Annihilation was cut in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You found a countermeasure so quickly…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Then Ashoka let out a low sigh as if it was regrettable.
 </p>
 <p>
  His acting was also top-notch despite teaching it himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  “However, I also have a move.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kurrr…
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Golden Wheel turned, soon.
 </p>
 <p>
  Time stopped.
 </p>
 <p>
  The dark sword filled with the void.
 </p>
 <p>
  The right hand emitting Total Annihilation, both stopped moving.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
 </p>
 <p>
  Step. Step.
 </p>
 <p>
  Only Ashoka was approaching with a fine face.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Don’t be flustered, stay calm. And Return of the Light…]
 </p>
 <p>
  And resonating in the mind, Ashoka’s voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  This time as well, like before, he was giving hints on how to break through this himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Like this, resistance is possible.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Before Ashoka could tell him the method, Seong Jihan resisted the time-manipulating authority first.
 </p>
 <p>
  The method was simply using Return of the Light together.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud.
 </p>
 <p>
  Due to that, the movement of the Golden Wheel stopped.
 </p>
 <p>
  Psssh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The color of one of the golden skulls faded to a reddish hue.
 </p>
 <p>
  -What? It’s not lagging, but it suddenly progressed with a whirr.
 </p>
 <p>
  -It seemed like the screen was paused for a moment…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh, could this have been using time reversal?
 </p>
 <p>
  -As expected, Seong Jihan had a countermeasure!
 </p>
 <p>
  The chat window that had stopped also instantly filled up with messages.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka was looking at Seong Jihan with a slightly surprised expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  [I apologize for saying your talent was ambiguous last time.]
 </p>
 <p>
  He nagged a lot before when he couldn’t complete the Taiji Sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  I guess his mind changed after seeing him overcome time reversal with Return of the Light before even being taught.
 </p>
 <p>
  While conveying his meaning in his mind like that, Ashoka.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Retrieving the hand has been determined to be impossible. Master, I will carry out the second order.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Outwardly showed a faithful attitude as the Martial God’s disciple.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Second order?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I will seal that hand.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as he finished speaking.
 </p>
 <p>
  Drrrk!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Golden Wheel turned two rotations.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, the time stopped.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan used Return of the Light like before, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This… I can’t respond right away like before.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps because he used more power from the Golden Wheel, Seong Jihan couldn’t immediately regain control of his body.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  While he was momentarily frozen, Ashoka, who had already approached close,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sleep for a bit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Tap.
 </p>
 <p>
  With his finger, he poked the red eye on the back of Seong Jihan’s hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  [What are you…! No. Wha, what is this? Why?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  At first, it seemed to resist, but the Red Eye quickly shrank.
 </p>
 <p>
  To the point where it looked more like a dot than an eye, only then did the shrinking end.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mmm…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  And only then did Seong Jihan, who regained control, frown while looking at the instantly sealed Red Hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  It had been a while since he was one-sidedly pushed back like this since Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, the Administrator’s Hand, why was it being sealed so easily?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…The opponent was weak to the void.’
 </p>
 <p>
  To escape from the defensive, Seong Jihan tried to draw out more void energy.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t do that. If you draw out more void energy, the time to talk will decrease.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Talk… You want to talk?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. You and I rarely have a chance to meet directly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, Ashoka put his two hands together in a prayer position.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kurrr!
 </p>
 <p>
  A huge hand rose from the arena floor and enveloped the two as if hiding them from the outside.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is…”

 <p>
  “Even if time is stopped, the Administrators may observe us. That’s why I prepared this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If they’re inside this palm, even the Administrators can’t see here?
 </p>
 <p>
  No, how was that possible…
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan looked at Ashoka as if it was absurd.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now that the preparations are complete. Let’s talk.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He sat comfortably on his own palm.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What do you want to talk about?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I analyzed Total Annihilation. You… had no desire at all for unification.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If by unification you mean.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Becoming the Red Administrator.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s eyes showed interest.
 </p>
 <p>
  Did he also know that humanity as a species itself was the Red Administrator?
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can you know even that by analyzing Total Annihilation?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can know.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re quite amazing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you for the compliment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking at the ever-leisurely Ashoka, Seong Jihan recalled the Ashoka from the seal.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was quite polite.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Come to think of it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  That Ashoka had given him an item.
 </p>
 <p>
  A piece of the Golden Wheel engraved with ‘Refraining from Enlightenment’.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan took it out from his inventory to show him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The item you from the seal gave me. You told me to tell the future you to not forget the vow of refraining from enlightenment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Refraining from enlightenment… In the endless ages, I have never forgotten that vow even once.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If I had forgotten the vow and attained enlightenment, I, Siddhartha, would have become Buddha… and taken the place of my disciple Sariputta.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan found it absurd to see Ashoka speaking seriously.
 </p>
 <p>
  No, he says if he just attains enlightenment, he’ll take Buddha’s place.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha… Be grateful that I’m not a Buddhist.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hoho. That’s a shame. There are truly many good teachings in it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon hearing those words, Ashoka laughed more joyfully than ever.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait, can you hand over that item?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What the past me did was crude. I’ll complete it a bit more.”
 </p>
 <p>
  An upgrade was always welcome.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan handed over the piece of the Golden Wheel engraved with ‘Refraining from Enlightenment’ to Ashoka.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ziiing…
 </p>
 <p>
  The piece of the Golden Wheel transformed into a small golden wheel.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now, you can turn back time once. Someone of your level should be able to go back up to a day.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…With this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. If you’re in danger, just break this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  To easily make an item that turns back time by a day just like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the amazing authority Ashoka displayed, Seong Jihan thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Could it be that it wasn’t just a bluff when he said he could take Sariputta’s place as Buddha if he just attained enlightenment…’
 </p>
 <p>
  If so, the real name of Buddha would have been Gautama Siddhartha.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan asked Ashoka, who was quietly looking at the completed Golden Wheel.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You… Don’t you regret it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Regret what?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not becoming Buddha.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not at all.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka handed over the Golden Wheel to Seong Jihan and asked with serious eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Rather, don’t you regret it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Me? I have no such regrets.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No such regrets. Isn’t there the position of the ‘Red Administrator’?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka asked why he had no desire for unification, and now he was asking about this topic again.
 </p>
 <p>
  The hand was also sealed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan revealed his true intentions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “To become the Administrator, I have to burn all 7 billion humans, who’s crazy to enough do that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even if you can revive the burned humanity after becoming the Administrator?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh… Is that so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Administrator is amazing, but even that is possible?
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s sufficiently possible with the Administrator’s authority. You can bring the body information of those who perished and replicate them identically.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Replicate… Then it’s not completely the same as the original person, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “From the perspective of others, not oneself, it’s no different.”
 </p>
 <p>
  That may be true, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If someone kills me and revives me through such a process by replicating me… Can I say that’s really me?’
 </p>
 <p>
  From others’ perspective, if the replicated human is the same as the original, they might just shrug it off.
 </p>
 <p>
  But from the perspective of the one dying, there is only one life.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether there is a spare replica of oneself or not, that’s not important.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If that’s how you revive, I won’t do it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. Others may be fine with it. But I can’t bear to see my family die and be resurrected like that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “In the end, it’s because of family? The reason for giving up on being the Administrator?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, I guess it comes down to that… Why? Is there a problem?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka laughed joyfully and shook his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No. There’s no problem at all. You are… the person I’ve been waiting for.”

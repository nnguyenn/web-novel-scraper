  Chapter 428
 </p>
 <p>
  The absolute weapon that could undo the seal on the Administrator’s hand by containing Total Annihilation.
 </p>
 <p>
  [First, you need to obtain SSS-grade equipment…]
 </p>
 <p>
  The first ingredient for this was grade SSS equipment.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You also need an artifact with high fire affinity. It won’t be easy to obtain, but…]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I happen to have one.’
 </p>
 <p>
  […You do?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded and pulled out the Phoenix Spear from his inventory.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it’s SSS-grade and fire affinity, this would be perfect.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You had a weapon like this?]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Did I not use it when you were around? It was a weapon I often used before.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a weapon he essentially used when operating the Crimson Thunder.
 </p>
 <p>
  But recently, when using the red stat, it was more direct to just use the power with the Administrator’s hand, so he hadn’t been using it much.
 </p>
 <p>
  [With this… the first condition is satisfied. You just need to infuse it with the energy of Total Annihilation.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘How do I do that?’
 </p>
 <p>
  [First write the destruction code, and write “ultimate skill” in front of it. Then it becomes Total Annihilation.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Ultimate skill? Are you kidding me?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Is he being serious?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan furrowed his brow.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I’m serious… It emphasizes the authority of destruction with special characters.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Then if I write “ultimate skill” in front of all the other codes, will they all be emphasized?’
 </p>
 <p>
  [No. It particularly emphasizes only total destruction.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  Turned out to be a silly existence when you got to know him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan smiled wryly and was about to write the code on the Phoenix Spear, but changed his mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I do as this guy says right now, then there’s no point in sealing him.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The hand’s seal that Ashoka carried out even while being stabbed.
 </p>
 <p>
  He couldn’t undo it so easily.
 </p>
 <p>
  Until he could fully utilize the red stat, it was more convenient to have the red eye closed like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hey, but if I do this, won’t my weapon disappear?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan began to seriously tackle the task.
 </p>
 <p>
  [So what if it disappears. You have me.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If you don’t get unsealed and the weapon disappears too, it’s a huge loss for me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  […Didn’t you not use this spear all this time?]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I was going to start expanding its utilization soon. Tell me honestly. If I write the ultimate skill destruction code, is there really no risk of losing the spear?’
 </p>
 <p>
  [It will 100% disappear. But I will return in exchange.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Then, the probability of losing the spear and you not getting unsealed?’
 </p>
 <p>
  [That… I can’t jump to conclusions but it’s around 50%.]
 </p>
 <p>
  This is it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What, 50%?! That’s a coin toss!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who had only been sending his thoughts to his arm, now let out a surprised voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The thing I hate most in the world is gambling. I can’t entrust my SSS-grade spear to such a probability.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Main Body! 50% is worth a shot! If it fails, you can just obtain it again, right?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “No. The Phoenix Spear has an option to upgrade guild traits. It’s too valuable to be consumed like this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It raises guild traits? That spear?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Among Seong Jihan’s words, the Administrator’s hand focused on something unexpected.
 </p>
 <p>
  […Then its performance as a complete weapon may not reach an actual SSS-grade.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Because of the additional option that raises guild performance?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s the problem. With this, the success probability may drop below 20%…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “This won’t do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Then the Phoenix Spear was out, and he needed to obtain a new SSS-grade weapon.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was slightly raising the corners of his mouth,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Oh no… If there was a code medium, it would have definitely succeeded. What a shame.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Code medium?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [A medium that can fully contain the code… That object possessed by the void can definitely contain the ultimate skill destruction code.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Administrator’s hand began to lament as it mentioned the code medium.
 </p>
 <p>
  Saying if only he had this.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Why is everything this guy needs in my inventory?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the Administrator’s hand suspiciously.
 </p>
 <p>
  Could it be that he knew and was doing this on purpose?
 </p>
 <p>
  “If I obtain this code medium thing, I just need to write the ultimate skill destruction code on it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you have that, you need to fuse it with that spear. Then you can see the ‘Spear of Total Annihilation’ that will always be activated.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… how do I fuse them?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Write the fusion code on both sides and combine them… That will give it a performance worthy of being an Administrator’s weapon.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “It can reach the level of an Administrator’s weapon? Can it really achieve such performance?”
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">

   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s eyes flashed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Phoenix Spear and the code medium.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were just sitting in his inventory recently because their utilization was ambiguous…
 </p>
 <p>
  If he fused them well, would they become an Administrator-grade weapon?
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s a spear with Total Annihilation always activated. If you add more red to it, you can further strengthen it. With this, it can become the main weapon of the Red Administrator.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hoh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  […But. Main Body, you don’t happen to have the code medium, do you?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “The void has it, you said. Would I have such a treasure?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Right. That’s true, but I have a feeling you know something…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s because I’m curious.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Indeed… There’s no way you would have it… If you did, you would have used it, not left it…]
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s right.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s a good thing he separated it from the sword and hand and didn’t use the spear after obtaining it.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was managing his expression like that,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ugh… I don’t have the leeway of power… This crazy seal… How can a mere constellation seal the Administrator’s hand?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I know, right. It was strong.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Main Body… Then find another SSS-grade fire attribute weapon separately, and just write ultimate skill on it and leave it…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then the weapon won’t fly away?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [With just the letters of ultimate skill, it won’t fly away… Rather, the weapon will be strengthened to match red.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The weapon doesn’t break and only gets strengthened.
 </p>
 <p>
  Except for the name being ‘ultimate skill’, it’s a completely good code.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, since it strengthens red, he couldn’t write it on all weapons.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay. Then I’ll steadily strengthen this weapon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Please… Main Body. You must… unseal me. Only then can we achieve the grand endeavor…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [And if you really can’t find an SSS-grade weapon, there is a final method… First, try inquiring about weapons…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  With those last words, the Administrator’s hand lost strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  Had it been sealed again?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Then.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan organized his thoughts about the absolute weapon ‘Spear of Total Annihilation’ that the Administrator’s hand had told him about.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I have all the ingredients ready, but there’s no need to combine them right now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If he completed the Spear of Total Annihilation, the Administrator’s hand would once again plead to undo the seal.
 </p>
 <p>
  Revealing his true intentions to this hand would have to wait until later.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll keep the code medium in my inventory.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He should try strengthening the Phoenix Spear first by writing ultimate skill on it.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan made that resolution,
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Uncle, did you unseal Red?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, who had been quietly listening from the side since Seong Jihan said he hated gambling, opened her mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “He was unsealed for a bit. But he told me how to undo the seal and got sealed again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, so it was possible to undo. How do you do it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He said to write ultimate skill on a weapon first.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Is he not in his right mind because he’s sealed?”
 </p>
 <p>
  This is the normal way to think.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded and looked at Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  Come to think of it,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I didn’t get to ask why he kept staring at Seah.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The red eye of the hand that kept looking at her, according to Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s no way the Administrator’s hand would look at Yoon Seah for no reason.
 </p>
 <p>
  There must be a reason.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recalled the hand’s last words.
 </p>
 <p>
  [And if you really can’t find an SSS-grade weapon, there is a final method… First, try inquiring about weapons…]
 </p>
 <p>
  The ‘final method’ that he didn’t specify.
 </p>
 <p>
  This must be the catch.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even if the hand tries to tempt you, ignore it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Haha, how could I touch Uncle’s belonging?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just do the opposite of whatever he says to you. We’re not in a fully cooperative relationship.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, is that so? There must be a reason… Okay, Uncle!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah nodded with her eyes wide open.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, I’ll go write ultimate skill for a bit and come back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…You’re really going to write that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded and disappeared into the void training room.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Ultimate skill, no matter how I think about it, it doesn’t make sense.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah looked at the spot where her uncle disappeared, tilted her head, and headed to the refrigerator.

 <p>
  Taking out an ice cream from there, she was eating it on the sofa while watching TV.
 </p>
 <p>
  Vibrate…
 </p>
 <p>
  She saw her vibrating phone.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hayeon unnie?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Beep.
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as she answered the call,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Seah! What did Boss do?!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Hayeon’s excited voice was heard from the phone.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s going on, unnie?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The guild options suddenly got strengthened! By +4 in all of them!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Re… really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yeah. I thought it wouldn’t be easy to increase further here, but how did they all rise by +4? Is the Boss at home by any chance?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, he went to the training room.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Is that so? What is he doing there…]
 </p>
 <p>
  At those words, Yoon Seah blinked.
 </p>
 <p>
  What Seong Jihan said he would do in the training room was definitely writing the ultimate skill…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Did that actually work?’
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Martial God’s star, Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You did well.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Martial God welcomed Ashoka, who had returned from the tournament, with a pleased voice for the first time in a while.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I couldn’t bring the hand, I’m ashamed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s fine. In the next tournament, Dongbang Sak can step up.]
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, only up to Level 8 constellations could participate in the tournament.
 </p>
 <p>
  But if Seong Jihan got promoted from the Challenger League, Level 9s will also be able to participate someday.
 </p>
 <p>
  If Dongbang Sak, the sole Level 9, steps up, retrieving the hand will be certain.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Before that, you’ve done your part sufficiently by sealing it so he can’t act recklessly.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Thank you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka, who had lowered his head and raised it, pointed to his pierced chest.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then… may I enter the seal site now to mend my wounds?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Entering the seal site on his own.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Seems he’s not harboring any rash intentions.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Martial God interpreted those words positively.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once inside the seal site, Ashoka wouldn’t be able to influence the outside world at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  And he would only come out at the final moment to assist the return by turning the Golden Wheel.
 </p>
 <p>
  Judging by his actions, he was the most loyal disciple to Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Is your body condition very bad?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was directly hit by the void’s sword. In this state, it will be difficult to operate the Golden Wheel even at the final moment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you were hit by the void to that extent… even if you go to the seal site, it will be hard to fully recover your body.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I will try my best.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Ashoka spoke plainly, Martial God’s eyes flashed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The attitude of trying his best was good, but if things go wrong at the final moment because of that, only he would suffer.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘His loyalty has been proven to a certain extent.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Martial God, whose mind had become more at ease after the Administrator’s hand was sealed, treated Ashoka more generously than usual.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Go to the Golden Tower. It will heal you there.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you mean Gilgamesh’s Tower of Babel?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. You can obtain a fruit that will heal your body. I will inform Pythia.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Thank you. I will follow your order.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka deeply bowed his head and soon disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Martial God looked at the spot where he disappeared for a moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, he activated Divine Eye without Pythia.
 </p>
 <p>
  Peering into the possibilities of the future through Divine Eye, he,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Indeed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  let out the most satisfied voice in recent times.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The future where I lose… is no longer visible.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who could only win by becoming the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now that the possibility had disappeared with Ashoka’s seal, Martial God’s victory was certain.
 </p>
 <p>
  [As soon as I retrieve the hand, I will wrap up this round.]
 </p>
 <p>
  This round.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was eventful, but if he just concluded it like this, it would be the time when he gained the most.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Martial God was evaluating the sealing achievement this time with satisfaction like that,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is this the place.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka set foot in the Golden Tower with sunken eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  There,
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re here? You did it today, huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  was Pythia with a full smile on her face in front of the tower.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh… ugh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  And Gilgamesh, with most of his body buried in the tower wall, barely showing his face.

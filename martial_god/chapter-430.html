  Chapter 430
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Sun King is ruthless.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you do not accept the proposal, he will burn your entire race.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But the Sun King is also merciful.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you meekly hand over the hand, he will gladly forgive you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  What nonsense were they spouting for so long?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the opponents in front of him.
 </p>
 <p>
  The total of 5 opponents were of various races, but they all had something in common.
 </p>
 <p>
  The very tip of their heads was burning fiercely.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This belongs to the Sun King.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Only he can possess it.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Those who covet it, their three generations shall perish.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Their faces and entire bodies had the brand of slavery engraved on them.
 </p>
 <p>
  And Seong Jihan had also seen these words before.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Dead Star Constellation showed me this.’
 </p>
 <p>
  However, even if the text itself was the same, there was a decisive difference between their brands and the brand stamped on the Dead Star Constellation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Power can be felt from their brands.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to the Dead Star Constellation who only had the brand remaining, the letters on them shone bright yellow and an intense energy of fire could be felt.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed to be an activated form of the enslavement text.
 </p>
 <p>
  And,
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Dead Star Constellation’ has sponsored 10 million GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [What’s with these guys, the slave text is alive? This is the Sun King exerting his power… Seong Jihan! Find out from them where they saw the Sun King!]
 </p>
 <p>
  This speculation became a fact due to the sponsorship sent by the Dead Star Constellation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “For free?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Dead Star Constellation’ has sponsored 10 million GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Of course there’s a price! I’ll help you catch the Sun King!]
 </p>
 <p>
  That just seems to align with his own goal.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan smiled wryly and asked the opponents in front of him,
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, where is that Sun King?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What would the likes of you do with that information?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If I give you my hand and you eat and run, what then? Even if I give it, I have to give it directly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A slave cannot betray his master.”
 </p>
 <p>
  While saying that, the Sun King’s slave pointed to his own brand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, I can’t trust that. Tell me where he is. Then I’ll see the Sun King’s size and give it to him or something.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan replied half-heartedly while picking his ear.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Insolent…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We do not know where he is either.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then how will you deliver it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s question, one of the slaves pointed to the flames burning above his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you present the item this way, it will reach him.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really? That’s interesting.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So quickly hand over the hand…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s all I need?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded and took out the Phoenix Spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fundamental Divine Arts,
 </p>
 <p>
  Heavenly Dragon Thunder Fire:
 </p>
 <p>
  Dragon Thunder
 </p>
 <p>
  The red current flickered momentarily at the tip of the spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  The bodies of the five players in front instantly burned and disappeared into dust.
 </p>
 <p>
  -?? What’s this?
 </p>
 <p>
  -They died as soon as he took out the spear?nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
 </p>
 <p>
  -There was a spark of electricity;
 </p>
 <p>
  -Seong Jihan is currently fighting Level 8 constellations, these small fries are one-shot lolol
 </p>
 <p>
  -Still, I thought there would be something since they’re the Sun King’s subordinates…
 </p>
 <p>
  The 5 subordinates disappeared without even a scream.
 </p>
 <p>
  All they left behind were the flames at the tips of their heads.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I had slightly miscontrolled the power, I would have burned this too.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He already knew through testing that the upgraded Red Cloud Phoenix Spear was powerful.
 </p>
 <p>
  But to think the minimally used Dragon Thunder would have such a strong output.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Dead Star Constellation’ has sponsored 10 million GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Aaaargh, My head. Why did you kill them like that!! How are we going to find out the Sun King’s location…! Do you know how hard it is to find someone with an activated slave brand…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just wait.”
 </p>

 <p>
  Seong Jihan lightly replied to the Dead Star Constellation’s message and gathered the flames they left behind.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flicker…
 </p>
 <p>
  The bright yellow burning flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps because the hosts disappeared, the size of the fire was small enough to fit in a human fist.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I put my hand in here, it will automatically be sent to the Sun King.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan stared at the flames blankly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  He put his right hand in and took it out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flicker…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The weakened flames that were about to go out became more intense.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm. I don’t particularly feel like it’s being sent.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan muttered like that and kept putting his hand in and out,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dragon Lord has sponsored 1 billion GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Seong Jihan, are you perhaps thinking of handing over your hand to the Sun King? Don’t act rashly. He is not someone to make deals with.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Sun King has sponsored 1 billion GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you want to beg for my mercy, keep the Administrator’s hand in. Don’t take it in and out like you’re doing now.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Two Great Constellations interested in the hand began to speak up while shooting 1 billion GP each.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow, the Great Constellations’ sponsorship units are different lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -For real, when the Dead Star Constellation sponsored 10 million GP, it seemed like a lot keke Is a 100 times difference for real?
 </p>
 <p>
  -How much GP does Seong Jihan have?
 </p>
 <p>
  -If converted to dollars, wouldn’t he be at the level of humanity’s richest?
 </p>
 <p>
  -The amount he earns through the guild is also not small…
 </p>
 <p>
  While the viewers were newly debating Seong Jihan’s wealth upon seeing the Great Constellations’ sponsorship amounts,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, Dragon Lord. How do I hand this over to you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan asked while waving his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dragon Lord has sponsored 1 billion GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You will give it to me? A wise decision. Since I am a constellation supporting you, you can hand it over by making a ‘special tribute’ to a constellation.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aha, is that so? It’s simple. Will it be okay even if it’s sealed?”
 </p>
 <p>
  To Seong Jihan’s question, a sponsorship message came up without delay.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dragon Lord has sponsored 1 billion GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s fine. If you hand over the hand, as promised before, I will give you the authority to command the Dragon Clan for 100 years and 1 quadrillion GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Certainly, the Dragon Lord, who was a better negotiation partner than the Sun King who threatened to kill him if he didn’t hand it over, was better.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  “The conditions are the same even if it’s sealed? You know how to make a deal.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who put his hand in and out of the Sun King’s fire, said,
 </p>
 <p>
  “But there’s something I want to obtain from the arena’s tournament. So I can’t give it to you right away.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He ultimately told the Dragon Lord that he wouldn’t hand over his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  -In the end, he’s not going to make the tribute… Isn’t this basically deceiving the Dragon Lord?
 </p>
 <p>
  -I don’t understand what nerve a mere player has to act up to a Great Constellation…
 </p>
 <p>
  -What will he do if the Dragon Clan is mobilized?
 </p>
 <p>
  The alien viewers initially evaluated Seong Jihan’s response as being reckless, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, but if the Sun King really invades Earth, I’ll give it to you right away. I don’t want to make an invader do good things.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Hearing Seong Jihan’s follow-up, they could understand why he was acting this way.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ah, he’s saying if they invade his planet, he’ll hand it over to the other side.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Showing that he can hand it over to his competitor at any time… Is that it?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Eh… but will he really hand it over?
 </p>
 <p>
  -If it’s him, it might be possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the alien viewers were discussing whether Seong Jihan would really hand it over or not,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Sun King has sponsored 1 billion GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ha, you dare to insult me? You think I won’t invade just because you do this?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Sponsorship also burst out from the Sun King’s side.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since the Great Constellations are sending messages, is today some special collection day?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then come and see. Well, if I were you, rather than taking on such a risk, I would just help me reach Challenger League 5.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan mentioned Challenger League 5 like that, the alien viewers paid attention to it.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why Challenger 5?
 </p>
 <p>
  -He’ll probably reach that soon even without help…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Then who will stop that monster?
 </p>
 <p>
  “If I become Challenger 5, even Great Constellations can participate in the tournament. You can win against me there and take it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Sun King has sponsored 1 billion GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [But you will be defeated in the tournament before that.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you don’t like that, then quickly raise me to League 5.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan lightly received the Sun King’s sponsorship message.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  -At Seong Jihan’s speed, it seems he’ll reach Challenger 5 soon…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Even if not the next tournament, maybe the one after that?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Honestly, it would be more realistic to prepare for the tournament in the time it takes to go to their planet.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But is Seong Jihan really thinking of fighting a Great Constellation in the tournament? Is he in his right mind?
 </p>
 <p>
  -If it were me, I would have handed it over to the Dragon Lord long ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  -For real, can’t resist 1 quadrillion lol
 </p>
 <p>
  Challenger League -5.
 </p>
 <p>
  Originally, it was the highest league that no one could easily see.
 </p>
 <p>
  But for a transcendent monster like Seong Jihan, this level could be reached quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  And if he becomes Challenger -5 like that, he’s saying he’ll fight a Great Constellation in the tournament.
 </p>
 <p>
  Far from trying to avoid this, he’s instead suggesting to quickly make him Challenger 5.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just what was this human thinking?
 </p>
 <p>
  The alien viewers were only left with questions, not even imagining that Seong Jihan might aim to become a temporary Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dragon Lord has sponsored 1 billion GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Alright. I will help you reach League -5. Look forward to it.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Lord was the first to accept Seong Jihan’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed, this side communicated well.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan was coordinating like that, looking at the chat window and messages for a while,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Um… our team is currently being pushed back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I think you need to participate.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Step. Step.
 </p>
 <p>
  Two one-eyed giant players approached beside him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I killed five earlier.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Still, you’re our team’s ace, but you’re not making any moves…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “At this rate, we’ll be pushed back on the battlefield. You need to advance.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Challenger’s Invade game, ‘Great Battlefield’.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this map where a chaotic fight of 100 vs 100 takes place, the team Seong Jihan belonged to was overall inferior in strength compared to the opponent.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead, the one balancing this power was the player who transcended leagues, Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  But he only killed five in the beginning and kept talking with the Great Constellations, so the scale of victory tilted to the other side.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is why Survival is comfortable.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether it’s Invade or Defense,
 </p>
 <p>
  Game formats with teammates are annoying like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just a moment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan took his gaze off the chat window and flew up to the sky to look ahead.
 </p>
 <p>
  The fierce battle of Challenger League.
 </p>
 <p>
  There, he could soon find the core power of the enemy.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Will it be manageable if those guys are dealt with?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Over there…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, that’s the core of the opposing team.”
 </p>
 <p>
  What Seong Jihan pointed to was the enemy team’s unit of about 30 people.
 </p>
 <p>
  Various races were moving organically and easily taking care of the relatively weaker allies.
 </p>
 <p>
  If only they disappeared, the losing game could regain balance.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then let’s just catch that for now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan said that and threw the Phoenix Spear into the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fundamental Divine Arts,
 </p>
 <p>
  Heavenly Dragon Thunder Fire
 </p>
 <p>
  Dragon Thunder
 </p>
 <p>
  As the spear disappeared, the sky soon turned red.
 </p>
 <p>
  When light struck down from there, not only the 30 Challenger 8 players but also the surrounding allies and enemies were all engulfed in red light and disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Previously, streams of fire would pour down from the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, the red light was annihilating everything.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Th-that… o-our team was also w-wiped out…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, sorry about this. I swept them all away.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He thought he controlled my power.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed the performance of the Red Cloud Phoenix Spear inflating the red stat was much better than expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then what’s the difference in strength between us and them now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It, it has improved a lot…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I see. Then I’ll participate in the battle again in a bit. You guys go ahead first.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, understood!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The one-eyed giants hurriedly left as Seong Jihan pointed to the battlefield with his finger.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan watched those teammates for a moment, then turned his gaze to the flames left on the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sun King’s slave flames that were almost extinguished without a host.
 </p>
 <p>
  He quietly watched them and slowly opened his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, Sun King. You sponsor me too.”

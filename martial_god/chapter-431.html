  Chapter 431
 </p>
 <p>
  -Suddenly… sponsorship?
 </p>
 <p>
  -The constellation candidate is trying to rip off a Great Constellation;
 </p>
 <p>
  -He has no fear, acting like that to the Sun King.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Isn’t he doing that because he doesn’t know his notoriety?
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s sudden sponsorship request, the viewers were all dumbfounded.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had been fiercely opposing the Sun King, burning his slaves and such.
 </p>
 <p>
  What sponsorship all of a sudden?
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Sun King has sponsored 1 billion GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Are you crazy?]
 </p>
 <p>
  And the Sun King’s reaction immediately popped up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan smiled seeing this message.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can hand over the hand to the Dragon Lord as a ‘special tribute’, but I can’t do that to you, right? If the Dragon Lord invades this side, I’ll have to hand over the hand to you, but I have no way to do that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  From Seong Jihan’s perspective, the Dragon Lord was a somewhat more friendly Great Constellation compared to the Sun King.
 </p>
 <p>
  But it was still an unchanging fact that both of them were monsters desiring the red hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather than believing the Dragon Lord’s outwardly friendlier attitude and getting backstabbed,
 </p>
 <p>
  it was better to prepare a means for them to keep each other in check.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The method of sending the hand to a Great Constellation as a special tribute should also be applicable to the Sun King.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan revealed his intention like this, the viewers finally understood his proposal.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh… he’s telling them to play the role of restraining each other.
 </p>
 <p>
  -This means the Dragon Lord can’t be fully trusted either.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Right, the Dragon Lord was also famous for being sinister, not someone to trust and go with.
 </p>
 <p>
  -He’s just telling both of them to not make reckless moves and enter the tournament.
 </p>
 <p>
  And from the Sun King’s side who understood the true meaning of this proposal, a message arrived immediately.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Great Constellation ‘Sun King’ is showing interest in you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [He wants to sponsor you. Will you accept?]
 </p>
 <p>
  He showed his pride, but he didn’t abandon practical benefits.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan stared blankly at this for a moment, then pressed yes.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Player Seong Jihan has accepted the sponsorship proposal of the Great Constellation ‘Sun King’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Received sponsorship from two Great Constellations.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The player’s attention has exceeded the threshold, raising the New Star level to 2.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Why is this rising?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The New Star level effect that was within the scope of the star buff rose, saying he received a Great Constellation’s sponsorship.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was a completely unexpected effect.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I hadn’t gotten involved with these guys, I would have never known this level up condition.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking that, Seong Jihan observed the effect of New Star level 2.
 </p>
 <p>
  [All stats are amplified by 130%.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The amplification efficiency of one designated stat can be increased by an additional 40 percent.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to New Star level 1, all stats rose by an additional 10 percent, and the designated stat also rose by an additional 10 percent.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was pretty good for an unintended reward.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan raised the corners of his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, the Sun King has also become a sponsoring constellation… Let’s end today’s game here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan raised his arm above his head, the Phoenix Spear that he had thrown into the sky a while ago entered his hand on its own.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since he had swept away even allies with Dragon Thunder, he would have to make up for that now.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was about to step forward,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Great Constellation ‘Sun King’ says he will specially bestow a gift to commemorate becoming a sponsoring constellation.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Flicker…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The dying embers of the Sun King’s slave fire intensified.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What gift all of a sudden?”
 </p>
 <p>
  He didn’t even ask for it, but he’s going out of his way to make a sponsorship item.
 </p>
 <p>
  Suspicious.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Great Constellation ‘Sun King’ says opportunities don’t come often and tells the player to take out the solar core fragment he possesses.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Solar core fragment?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Great Constellation ‘Sun King’ interrogates the player, saying didn’t he obtain something from the Mecan planet.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At those words, Seong Jihan recalled the solar core fragment.
 </p>
 <p>
  -That’s the solar core that was at the center of the Mecan planet. There were 3, but I’m using 2 to track the Sun King.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan revealed the relationship between the Mecan planet and the Sun King during the Space League match with them,
 </p>
 <p>
  the Dead Star Constellation had personally swept the Mecan planet and collected the solar core fragments.
 </p>
 <p>
  He said he would take two to pursue the Sun King and give one as a memento.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan took out the solar core fragment that had been stuffed in the corner of his inventory.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Used Solar Core Fragment]
 </p>
 <p>
  -Grade: SS
 </p>
 <p>
  -A solar core fragment imbued with the Great Constellation Sun King’s authority.

 </div>
 <p>
  -Needs to be charged.
 </p>
 <p>
  The solar core fragment that had lost its light but still had an item grade of SS.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you talking about this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Great Constellation ‘Sun King’ tells you to bring the solar core to the fire.]
 </p>
 <p>
  For the Sun King to go this far to give a gift,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He must have played a trick with it for sure.’
 </p>
 <p>
  While convinced of that, Seong Jihan tried putting the solar core into the fire for now.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Shuu…
 </p>
 <p>
  The embers were instantly absorbed into the solar core, and a yellow light flickered in the solar core fragment.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Activated Solar Core Fragment]
 </p>
 <p>
  -Grade: SS+
 </p>
 <p>
  -A solar core fragment imbued with the Great Constellation Sun King’s authority.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Has begun charging light.
 </p>
 <p>
  -If continuously exposed to sunlight, it will upgrade to a more advanced solar core.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Great Constellation ‘Sun King’ informs you that if you leave the solar core under the light, it will develop on its own.]
 </p>
 <p>
  At that message, Seong Jihan slightly raised the corners of his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since when did he become so kind?
 </p>
 <p>
  But for now, he had to pretend to go along with it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright. I’ll gladly accept it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After storing the activated solar core back in his inventory, Seong Jihan took a step forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the direction he stepped towards,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh, ugh…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The one-eyed giant who had asked Seong Jihan to participate earlier was collapsing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, you were still alive?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Y-you are…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll end the game now. If you want the victory reward, don’t die.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Hearing those words, the one-eyed giant gritted his teeth and covered his wounds with his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering the martial art Seong Jihan had shown earlier, this was a sufficiently feasible statement.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha. What’s the point of living like that…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ending the game? A race so small that they can’t even be seen properly is just full of bluffs.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That guy is smaller than my hand.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s end it quickly. We need to go to Challenger 7.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The group of opposing races on the other side of Seong Jihan unfortunately didn’t recognize him and were approaching on their own.
 </p>
 <p>
  -They don’t know Seong Jihan?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Not every player in the world knows Seong Jihan lol I also recently joined because of Total Annihilation.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But they’re in the same Challenger league.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Do you think they know all the opposing players just because they’re in Challenger…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Seems like they don’t think at all that the player who used the sky’s flames earlier is this person.
 </p>
 <p>
  Amidst the coexistence of reactions asking how they still don’t know Seong Jihan and reactions asking why players should know him when he became famous not long ago,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thanks for coming on your own, kids.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Phoenix Spear gripped by Seong Jihan moved lightly.
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  Total Annihilation Horizontal Sweep
 </p>
 <p>
  Chiiiik!
 </p>
 <p>
  A trajectory drawn in a straight line.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wha-what is this?”
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can’t regenerate…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The opposing players who had tried to trample Seong Jihan with their size were all split in half and instantly engulfed in flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  The enemies who didn’t burn for long and turned to ashes in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Well, they’ll know now… Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  -They won’t be able to forget for life lol. Because they gave up a won game.
 </p>
 <p>
  As such messages were posted in the chat window,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wha-what the…!?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why is my body suddenly…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The power of Total Annihilation Horizontal Sweep spread endlessly, cutting all the surviving players on the battlefield in half.
 </p>
 <p>
  Roll. Roll.
 </p>
 <p>
  The one-eyed giant only moved his pupils aimlessly while lying down.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s a good thing I was behind that person, if I was in front…’
 </p>
 <p>
  He would have also been split in half like that and burned.

 <p>
  And before long,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The game is ending.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The game end message popped up in front of the one-eyed giant’s eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  This Great Battlefield was clearly a huge battlefield where 100 vs 100 clashed.
 </p>
 <p>
  But that tiny player threw and swung his spear alone, and it exploded.
 </p>
 <p>
  The giant thought,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Let’s not match for a while. Until that monster goes up to a higher league.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Although he got a free win this time, next time he might face that guy as an enemy.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he became an enemy and got swept away at once like this, it seemed he would feel a sense of futility no matter how much he tried in the BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Alright. Let’s go on a vacation.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The one-eyed giant decided to take a week off while looking at Seong Jihan like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  After the game ended,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to examine this first.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan immediately entered the void training room and took out the solar core the Sun King had charged.
 </p>
 <p>
  Zing…
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps because there was no sunlight inside the training room, there was no sight of it absorbing light, only faintly emitting a yellow glow.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s see. If I change the map setting…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan tried changing the map inside the training room to the Great Battlefield map from earlier, where there was a sun.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  The solar core that seemed to momentarily absorb the sunlight of the Great Battlefield map while emitting light
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It has changed back to its original mode again.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It no longer devoured the light and had changed to the same state as before.
 </p>
 <p>
  Does this mean it doesn’t absorb artificial sunlight?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm… That Sun King bastard wouldn’t have given it for no reason. There must be something.’
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan was examining the solar core with such conviction,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Main Body… What’s that?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The sealed red hand slightly opened its eyes, perhaps stimulated by the solar core.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s something the Sun King gave me. A solar core fragment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Solar core… I think if I eat that, the probability of undoing the seal will increase by 1 percent. Give it to me as food.]
 </p>
 <p>
  This hand is asking for it as if it’s natural.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, this won’t do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Why not?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “That Sun King bastard isn’t someone who would meekly give such a thing. He must have played a trick with it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I think I know what he did with it.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh. Really? What is it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As expected of the Administrator’s hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s quick to figure it out.
 </p>
 <p>
  To Seong Jihan’s question, the red hand replied,
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you gather sunlight in reality, not this artificial sunlight, the Sun Incarnation function will activate.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sun Incarnation?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [If that activates, the Sun King will break that core and pop out. Look closely under the core. There are letters.]
 </p>
 <p>
  At those words, Seong Jihan held up the solar core.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the bottom part of the solar core, so finely that it was completely invisible without paying close attention, very minute letters were engraved.
 </p>
 <p>
  The letters read as ‘Sun Incarnation’.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You know quite a lot about the Sun King. What was your relationship with him?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Sun King was a disciple of the Red Administrator. A disciple whose talent was far inferior to his master’s, only suitable to be used as a worker.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “He was a disciple? Still better than the Dragon Lord.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He heard the Dragon Lord was the Administrator’s mount.
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s words, the hand rolled its eyeballs.
 </p>
 <p>
  [What are you saying? The mount was treated better than the disciple.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Is that so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Isn’t it obvious? A pet is cuter than a servant, no, a disciple.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is the Dragon Lord cute?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’ll know if you become the Red Administrator. Quite cute.]
 </p>
 <p>
  If he has to become the Red Administrator to know the cuteness, he’ll never know in his life.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan smiled wryly and looked at the solar core.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it receives sunlight, the Sun King will be summoned…
 </p>
 <p>
  [Then since your curiosity is satisfied, give me that as food.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey. I’ll give you something better later. I think this can be used separately.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [No. You have to eat that…! Only then can the seal be undone!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait a bit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ugh. Strength, my strength… Damn seal…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan watched the hand get sealed at a good timing, then turned his gaze back to the solar core.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Solar core. If used well, this could have tremendous destructive power.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s too wasteful to give a rock that can call the Sun King as food to the hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s eyes flashed intensely.

  Chapter 432
 </p>
 <p>
  A few days later.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have been promoted to Challenger League 7.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was cruising through the Challenger League at a rapid pace.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the first place, he was someone who fought high-level constellations.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Challenger League was too easy a stage for him.
 </p>
 <p>
  He thought about the next step.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to reach Challenger League 5 to call the Great Constellations to the tournament, and I have to defeat them there to become a temporary Administrator.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The task he faced now was to first reach Challenger League 5.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking at the performance Seong Jihan was showing in the current Challenger League, it seemed he would reach it soon, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  [To be promoted to Challenger League 6, your level must be 600 or higher.]
 </p>
 <p>
  An unexpected problem was revealed in the promotion.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘My current level is… 581, right? Actually, this growth speed is tremendously fast.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan had already surpassed level 500 and risen to the Challenger League not long ago, and he was already looking at 600.
 </p>
 <p>
  But for him, even this speed felt somewhat lacking.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had to quickly rise to Challenger 5, but this felt like it would be blocked once.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Still, with this, I won’t have to face a Great Constellation for about one tournament. It’s better to prepare thoroughly until then.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Great Constellations, beings that transcend constellations by one level.
 </p>
 <p>
  In fact, they were opponents of a different class for a constellation candidate like Seong Jihan to challenge.
 </p>
 <p>
  No wonder Yggdrasil called it an ‘amazing achievement’ that could make one a temporary Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The most suitable time to fight a Great Constellation would be right before becoming a constellation at level 700.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Once he became a constellation, he couldn’t clear the achievement of becoming an Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he defeated a Great Constellation around level 700 and became a temporary Administrator, it would be perfect.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anyway, it wasn’t bad that there was a level restriction on the promotion to Challenger League 6.
 </p>
 <p>
  He could grow as much as possible and challenge the Great Constellations.
 </p>
 <p>
  But what bothered him was,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘In the next tournament, Martial God might have Dongbang Sak participate.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak, the pinnacle of martial arts, known as the ‘Cosmic Demon’ in the BattleNet and an object of fear for constellations.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he participated and reached the finals, he might have to use the things he had prepared to fight the Great Constellations here.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘And even if I mobilize everything like that, I’m skeptical if I can easily achieve victory against him… It’s better not to face him if possible.’
 </p>
 <p>
  According to Ashoka, Dongbang Sak also seemed to be preparing to interfere with Martial God inside Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  If they met in the tournament, it would likely result in both sides just exhausting each other.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s best if Dongbang Sak can’t participate in this tournament.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking that, Seong Jihan slowly opened his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Everyone, I’ve become Challenger 7, but a problem has arisen.”
 </p>
 <p>
  -Problem?
 </p>
 <p>
  -What problem after blowing up the game by yourself again today?
 </p>
 <p>
  “It says I can’t go to Challenger 6 because my level is low. I was trying to reach Challenger 5 by the next tournament in a week.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s words, the viewers who were about to leave the chat window after today’s game ended were excited.
 </p>
 <p>
  -?? What? You can’t be promoted because your level is low?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is that possible? When you’re that strong?
 </p>
 <p>
  -What level are you exactly?
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s 581.”
 </p>
 <p>
  -What, not even 600? kekeke
 </p>
 <p>
  -I thought you were close to a constellation, but you’re still far.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Most of the people rolling in Challenger League easily surpass level 600, so I never thought there would be such a restriction.
 </p>
 <p>
  -So there was a level 600 restriction like that…
 </p>
 <p>
  Most players rolling in the Challenger League were above level 600.
 </p>
 <p>
  And most players aiming for Challenger 6 or higher had surpassed level 700, so the viewers had no way of knowing there would be such a level restriction on league promotion.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then the Great Constellations won’t be able to participate in the next tournament. Because the level is nowhere near enough.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan said that and shrugged his shoulders, a chat came up.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Isn’t that good then? You don’t need to face Great Constellations in the tournament lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -But if there’s a restriction on League 6, wouldn’t there also be one on League 5? Around 650.
 </p>
 <p>
  -If there’s a level restriction there too, the Great Constellations might not be able to participate not only in this tournament but also the next one, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  -If the current level is 581, reaching 650 by the tournament after next seems impossible.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Right lol Originally, rising by 1 at such a high level is slow, Seong Jihan’s speed is just crazy.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the viewers said, if there was a level restriction on Challenger League 6, there was likely one on 5 as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, wouldn’t the Great Constellations be unable to participate until the tournament after next, which was fighting over the red hand?
 </p>
 <p>
  “For now, I’ll work hard on leveling up. Although there’s a limit since I can only participate in the game once a day.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan said that and was about to turn off BattleTube.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Great Constellation ‘Dragon Lord’ says if you want to level up, make sure to participate in the match against the Dragon Clan in the Space League.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Lord’s message popped up.
 </p>
 <p>
  This,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I think I had a similar experience before against Yggdrasil.’
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  “Why? To let me use the Dragon Clan as experience points?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Great Constellation ‘Dragon Lord’ says he will push you more certainly than during Yggdrasil.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Pushing more than that time?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan blinked.
 </p>
 <p>
  How can he confidently push more than the elves?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘At that time, the World Tree Elf 55 was exterminated by Yggdrasil’s descent.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The level up effect Seong Jihan received in exchange for the extermination was only 20.
 </p>
 <p>
  Is it possible to level up much more than that?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan had these doubts, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Well, alright. I’ll participate in the Space League.”
 </p>
 <p>
  For now, he accepted the proposal and turned off BattleTube.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, when he came out to the living room,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, Uncle! You ended the game at just the right timing?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, who was fiddling with a bow, waved her hand at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What timing?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, did you forget? Today is the finals!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Finals… of the Beginner’s Arena?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yep.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Beginner’s Arena, which started around the same time as Seong Jihan’s tournament but hadn’t ended yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  Humanity had occasional crises but ultimately reached the finals while continuing a winning streak.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I wonder what evolution bonus they’ll give if we win this time? We’ve only benefited from Uncle all this time, but this time we’ll be helpful for the first time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, not exactly for the first time…”
 </p>
 <p>
  No. Wasn’t it the first time?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan smiled wryly, recalling the times he had earned humanity’s evolution bonuses.
 </p>
 <p>
  He really earned all the evolution bonuses himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  [Seah. It’s over. Be careful and surrender right away if you sense something wrong with the void. Okay?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jiah, who was floating next to Yoon Seah, earnestly advised her while granting her the void.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is this similar to the effect of the Blessing of Undead?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the members of the human representative team in the Beginner’s Arena, Yoon Seah, despite being an archer, was in charge of the front.
 </p>
 <p>
  The reason she stepped forward was to fully utilize the undead effect that allowed her to perform the role of a warrior 100%.
 </p>
 <p>
  If she couldn’t activate the undead effect, even if the Beginner’s Arena was tailored for humanity, it was the consensus of experts that she would have been eliminated in the semifinals or quarterfinals.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at Yoon Seah, who was holding the energy of the void.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wouldn’t it be too much to give her the Blessing of Undead here too?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Uh, Jihan. There’s no need to go that far.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right. Go and come back safely. Let me also get the race bonus.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll bring back something good. Look forward to it~”
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, equipped with the void buff, disappeared like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her figure soon appeared on the TV screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Finally, the finals of the Beginner’s Arena begin today!
 </p>
 <p>
  =There have been many twists and turns, but the human representative team has sailed smoothly so far!
 </p>
 <p>
  =It was a game that player Seong Jihan couldn’t participate in, but reaching the finals is still…
 </p>
 <p>
  =Player Yoon Seah played the biggest role!
 </p>
 <p>
  And Yoon Seah was zoomed in on the screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the purple energy of the void faintly rising from her, she took a position at the very front alongside Yoon Sejin.
 </p>
 <p>
  =In the human representative team lacking front power, player Yoon Seah perfectly covered it despite it not being her position.
 </p>
 <p>
  =If humanity wins in this final, the MVP of this arena will undoubtedly be player Yoon Seah to the point of no disagreement!
 </p>
 <p>
  =The opposing race in the finals also showed quite a powerful appearance… but objectively, the power of the human representative team looks better!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah. The match is starting!
 </p>
 <p>
  The finals of the Beginner’s Arena that began like that, the battle between the two races that broke through fierce competition for the race bonus,
 </p>
 <p>
  “…We have too much of an advantage compared to what I thought?”
 </p>
 <p>
  When the lid was opened, humanity was overwhelmingly in the lead.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah. An opposing player is already critically wounded!
 </p>
 <p>
  =The red lizardman opens its mouth and shoots flames, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  =The flames easily disappear with player Yoon Sejin’s sword energy!
 </p>
 <p>
  =This race. Are they really the race that reached the finals? They’re not showing the powerful performance they displayed in the semifinals and quarterfinals at all!
 </p>
 <p>
  Humanity’s opponent in the finals was the red-skinned lizardmen.
 </p>
 <p>
  These bipedal lizard humans, whose characteristic was breathing out intense flames from their mouths like dragons, had won until the finals by surprisingly opening their mouths and shooting breaths in each battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Those lizardmen have a bad matchup against us.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Against humanity, who had greatly increased fire attribute in the race evolution bonuses, those flames didn’t exert much power.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ugh. The, the fire breath is…!
 </p>
 <p>
  -Being blocked so futilely…
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  -Weren’t they just an ordinary race? Why is their fire resistance so strong…
 </p>
 <p>
  The opposing team was flustered as their sure-kill attack was easily blocked.
 </p>
 <p>
  The human representative team launched fierce attacks against them, and,
 </p>
 <p>
  =Another player from the opposing team falls!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Uh. At this rate, it might end faster than the semifinals!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Today, there’s no need for even player Yoon Seah to step up and block! Player Yoon Sejin alone is enough to handle it, the enemy’s attacks are not threatening at all!
 </p>
 <p>
  =We’ve seized the upper hand!
 </p>
 <p>
  The arena finals, which all of humanity watched in anticipation of the evolution bonus, were quickly coming to an end.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The fire attribute you’ve earned so far has shone, Jihan.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, it’s not like I chose it because I liked it. I just received what was given.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Is that so? But will the fire attribute rise this time too?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Who knows.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who was conversing with Seong Jiah, frowned at that question.
 </p>
 <p>
  Recalling the fire attribute received so far, it was too continuous to call it a coincidence.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If it comes out again this time, we’ll have to see it as completely intentional.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking that, Seong Jihan waited for the game to end.
 </p>
 <p>
  The one-sided battle progressing on the screen,
 </p>
 <p>
  =Ah. Player Yoon Seah!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Pierces the head of the last lizardman player with an arrow!
 </p>
 <p>
  =Victory, it’s victory!
 </p>
 <p>
  =The human representative team wins the Beginner’s Arena!
 </p>
 <p>
  ended with Yoon Seah’s finishing blow piercing the opponent’s head.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Achieving such a feat even without player Seong Jihan…!
 </p>
 <p>
  =At first, there was a lot of worry when player Seong Jihan couldn’t participate. The representative team is achieving results beyond expectations!
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan’s name, who didn’t even participate, kept being mentioned by the commentators, Seong Jiah said,
 </p>
 <p>
  [They seem happy that they won without you. The commentators keep talking about you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “They rarely win without me. This is quite a memorable occasion.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan replied like that and waited for the victory bonus.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ve always been the one riding, but now I get to see someone else giving me a ride.’
 </p>
 <p>
  What will come out? After a brief wait,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ding!
 </p>
 <p>
  A message window popped up in front of his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The special reward, ‘Race Evolution Bonus’ will be given.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Fire Attribute has increased by +5.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Strength has increased by +3.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Agility has increased by +3.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Humanity received evolution bonuses in a total of three categories.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among them, the increase in strength and agility was welcome as it hadn’t happened much recently, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Fire attribute again?”
 </p>
 <p>
  […Is there really something? Why is only this being caught?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The fire attribute given this time made even those who didn’t know the circumstances feel the strangeness.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just how many fire attribute bonuses have been received so far?
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ma, Main Body… what did you do? The seal has weakened.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A more vigorous voice than before was heard from the red hand that had its eyes closed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘As a reward for the Beginner’s Arena, the fire attribute of all humanity has risen.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [Again? What the. Wasn’t that a game hosted by the void?]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Right.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [The void wouldn’t help the red… strange.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The red hand, which was suspicious of this even though it directly benefited from the fire attribute bonus, perhaps because it was given by the void,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Anyway, can’t miss this chance. I’ll recover a bit more and try to undo the seal. Main Body, you should also quickly find a weapon.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Okay.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Saying it would seriously try to undo the seal, it went into hiding again.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This reward from the void only helps the Red Administrator…’
 </p>
 <p>
  What are they thinking?
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan was harboring doubts about the void’s intention,
 </p>
 <p>
  Vibrate…
 </p>
 <p>
  His phone was vibrating like crazy at the right timing.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Who is it?’
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan touched the screen,nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
 </p>
 <p>
  [Seong Jihan!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [I, I have come!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Will I die like this… I will take revenge. And I will sow my seed!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hey. What are you doing?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Answer me. Answer me! Seong Jihan. Don’t tell me you can’t see my messages…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  There, Gilgamesh, who had said he would contact him through the half-elf community,
 </p>
 <p>
  was pouring out messages with that ID.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What. You were alive?”

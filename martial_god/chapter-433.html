 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the message on his phone and thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Gilgamesh must have been used as a shield by Pythia and became gravely injured.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In that state, if Pythia had wanted to eliminate him, she could have done so at any time.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the fact that she didn’t, and he’s still alive like this……
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Does that mean they still have some use for Gilgamesh?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if he can’t reproduce, they must still have some use for him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan coldly stared at Gilgamesh’s message saying he would spread his seed, then responded to him for now.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You didn’t die?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Oh, you responded! Looks like the message went through well……!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh immediately replied to Seong Jihan’s response.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Answer my question first.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ah, right. You asked if I didn’t die? I almost died by your damn flames, but these guys saved me……]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Why would they bother? When you can’t even reproduce?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [What do you mean I can’t reproduce…! I can’t believe that! Pythia’s words must be lies. There’s no way I, the king of humans, won’t be able to have offspring? If I test it again in a lab, I’ll be able to see my children!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh had a fit when the topic of reproducing came up.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed he still couldn’t believe it even after hearing the truth from Pythia.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, he must have really looked forward to having descendants…… He’d want to deny reality.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If it’s confirmed that he’s sterile, he might lose the will to live.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no need to shove more facts in this guy’s face.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought so and changed the subject.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Whatever. You can figure out the descendant issue yourself…… How are you able to contact me?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s……]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Pythia wouldn’t just leave you alone, so how is she letting you send messages like this? Isn’t this a trap?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [……No, the reason I gained some freedom to send messages like this is thanks to Ashoka. After he hit me, the restrictions loosened a bit. I’m not sure why though……]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ashoka did?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [And as humanity gained evolution bonuses, I found a bit more freedom. The evolution of humanity is directly tied to my growth, you see.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [I see……]
 </p>
 <p>
  Gosh, what a strange coincidence.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan suspiciously watched the messages,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Of course, I also think it’s suspicious that I’m able to send messages in this situation…… I can hardly believe it myself, so you must find it even more so.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh readily admitted that Seong Jihan had reason to be suspicious.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Good thing you know.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [So listen assuming this might be a trap too.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [What is it?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Remember my Golden Tower?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tower of Babel?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. Its original name is Etemenanki though.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tower of Babel is easier, so let’s go with that.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recalled the time he had entered Tower of Babel in-game before and sent a simple reply message.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Anyway, I do remember that tower. Why?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tower of Babel is actually a collection of my authority. I tried to realize the domination codes that even I can’t perfectly handle yet through this tower.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [……How did you try to realize it?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Once Tower of Babel is completed on Earth, humanity will naturally follow the king they should follow.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned upon seeing that message.
 </p>
 <p>
  Trying to spread domination codes through the Tower of Babel.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was trying to commit quite an evil act.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Originally, I tried to move the one in Tuseong to Earth. Then, starting with the humans in the Babylonian region, they would follow my orders, and with these loyal subjects, I planned to expand my dominion.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Good thing you were ruined.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Kuk…… Humanity should naturally follow me, Gilgamesh, the progenitor of the species and the first king. Why do you rebel so much?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you’re going to keep spouting nonsense, I’m ending this conversation.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [……Ha, it can’t be helped. A parent must endure a child’s rebellion.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [I’m leaving.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ah, alright. For now, I’ll make you realize your true position later.]
 </p>
 <p>
  His true position?
 </p>
 <p>
  Is Gilgamesh planning to keep involving him later, saying he’s his child?
 </p>
 <p>
  He didn’t say such things when they first met.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s more annoying that he keeps trying to involve me after seeing my abilities.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Why did this jerk become humanity’s progenitor?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan sighed at this world again and sent a message.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stop the nonsense and get to the point quickly.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [……Okay, got it. I’ll talk about the main point. Tower of Babel will be summoned to Earth.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [What?]
 </p>

 <p>
  [Martial God and Pythia fused me with the tower. They’re going to summon it to Earth. Seems like the preparations are already complete.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan blinked at Gilgamesh’s message.
 </p>
 <p>
  What are these guys trying to pull again?
 </p>
 <p>
  [Why are they summoning it? To control humanity as the Tower of Babel was originally intended for?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [……Who knows. I don’t know how they’ll use it either. The current me is at my limit just sending messages like this.]
 </p>
 <p>
  At those words, Seong Jihan recalled when he met Ashoka at the previous tournament.
 </p>
 <p>
  -In the end, the source of Martial God’s power is the Constellation relics and the Golden Tower.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Dongbang Sak will take care of the Constellation relics, and I will topple the Golden Tower.
 </p>
 <p>
  Tower of Babel, which Ashoka noted as the source of Martial God’s power besides the Constellation relics.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed clear that the tower didn’t just possess the authority of domination.
 </p>
 <p>
  If such a thing was summoned to Earth, it felt unsettling just thinking about it.
 </p>
 <p>
  [……If the preparations are complete, will it be summoned right away?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [No. They said I’m grounded for a month for touching a Constellation Candidate. It will be summoned once that’s over.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Grounded for a month.
 </p>
 <p>
  Was that the penalty for touching a Constellation Candidate?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A month…… The punishment isn’t that severe, surprisingly.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Wasn’t the reason Martial God didn’t eliminate Seong Jihan right away because he was a Constellation Candidate?
 </p>
 <p>
  If they knew the punishment would only be a month of grounding, it seems they would have sent Dongbang Sak or Pythia long ago to try to kill him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan kept this fact in mind and asked Gilgamesh about the location Tower of Babel would be summoned to.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Where will it be summoned?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The original place I tried to summon Tower of Babel was Uruk…… But since the ownership was taken, I’m not sure if it will be there. If I find out the location, I’ll message you right away.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’re being quite cooperative.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s the only way for me to survive now.]
 </p>
 <p>
  After living that long, his will to live is still tenacious.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at Gilgamesh’s message, then asked him something he was curious about.
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you want to live that badly, why don’t you spill everything? Like your contract with Martial God or his identity. If I win, wouldn’t your survival chances be higher?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. Now that the contract is broken anyway, there’s no need to keep secrets. Right now-]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as it seemed he would spill everything, the message cut off at ‘right now’.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Pythia came. Later.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  It cuts off at the crucial moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  No.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘In this case, I should consider the possibility of it being a trap.’
 </p>
 <p>
  When he asked for information on Martial God, the chat conveniently ended saying Pythia came.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh may not have loosened his own restrictions, but was being used by them.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If that’s the goal, it might be to lure me to where Tower of Babel is summoned.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If that was their intention, their plan had succeeded to some extent.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if it was a trap, he couldn’t just ignore the suspicious Tower of Babel being summoned.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…… Still, even if it’s a trap, there are ways to make use of it on our side.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought so and recalled the solar core he had received from the Sun King.
 </p>
 <p>
  If they were to summon the Tower of Babel in Tuseong to Earth, a connection pathway to Tuseong would definitely open.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he threw the solar core into the pathway then, he could make the troublesome enemies fight each other.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘For now, I should keep receiving information…… Even to use it against them.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought that way and looked at the phone screen where the messages had stopped with sunken eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  [Humanity wins the Beginner’s Arena without Seong Jihan!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yoon Seah, who was named the MVP of the Beginner’s Arena. Evaluated as the undisputed world rank 2 in name and reality.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Another fire attribute bonus? At this point, it’s hard to see it as a coincidence in the evolution bonuses.]
 </p>
 <p>
  After the Beginner’s Arena ended, articles covering it began to pour out.
 </p>
 <p>
  The spotlight was focused on the players who won the arena.
 </p>
 <p>
  And among them, Yoon Seah, who performed the role of a warrior excellently, was highly rated as being world rank 2 now.
 </p>
 <p>
  But what brought about even more buzz was the fire attribute bonus given this time as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  – What, they keep giving only fire attribute??
 </p>
 <p>
  – Just give us +5 vitality ㅡㅡ Honestly, ordinary people don’t feel much difference.
 </p>
 <p>
  – ㄴㄴ We get burned a bit less
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wow….. Only the magicians focusing on fire attribute are blessed lol
 </p>
 <p>
  – At this rate; Yoon Seah might have her rank 2 taken by magicians.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Eh, how is Yoon Seah rank 2? She got the MVP this time as a special case.
 </p>
 <p>
  – What are you saying; Excluding Seong Jihan, she’s the undisputed rank 2; Didn’t you see her 100% fulfilling the warrior role?
 </p>
 <p>
  – I still think Yoon Sejin is better.
 </p>
 <p>
  – For now, it’s still Oliver from the US.
 </p>
 <p>
  – ?? Did we watch the same match? Where were your eyes?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Even if I can’t beat uncle, I can aim for rank 2 now!”
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, who was smiling as she looked at the comment window where debates were unfolding over the world rank 2 spot,
 </p>
 <p>
  “But why do only fire attribute bonuses keep coming out? Isn’t it a bit strange?”
 </p>
 <p>
  raised a question about the consecutive fire attribute bonuses.
 </p>
 <p>
  […… Is humanity’s deep connection with the Red Administrator manifesting here too?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, I knew there was some connection…… But to that deep of a degree?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yeah. I think the reason you couldn’t do the race change last time is probably due to that influence, Seah.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You mean when I got the acupuncture point?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah recalled the moment she almost unknowingly underwent a race change with the acupuncture point and frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Was that not possible because of the deep ties with the Red Administrator?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yeah.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jiah answered like that and looked at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Back then, her brother had clearly said that humanity itself was the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…… There’s no need to tell Seah about this in detail.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jiah stopped talking there.
 </p>
 <p>
  She didn’t want to tell her daughter, who was happy about essentially being humanity’s rank 2, unpleasant things for no reason.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, Seong Jihan also read his sister’s mood and changed the subject.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This evolution bonus…… They must have selectively given it in the arena, right? Then we can say the Void’s side was involved.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yeah, that’s probably the case.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The race change kit Seong Jiah originally tried to use to transform Yoon Seah was also an item from the Void’s laboratory.
 </p>
 <p>
  It could be seen that the fact that humanity was related to the Red Administrator had already been updated on their side.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan thought about this, a sudden thought occurred to him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sis, there’s one thing I’m curious about.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [What?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you touch a Constellation Candidate, you get penalized. Who judges the severity of that offense, and who gives out the punishment?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That? Well……]
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps Seong Jihan’s question was unexpected, as Seong Jiah pondered and said.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hmm…… The penalties are set, as far as I know. I heard they punish it quite severely. Blocking the path of a player who can develop into a constellation is seen as interfering with the proper growth cycle of the BattleNet.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, they said it’s a month of grounding.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [What? Just that? That can’t be right. Then everyone would try to cut them down before they become a constellation. The frequency of constellations emerging in the BattleNet would decrease significantly.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right? The punishment is too light?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [A month is practically nothing. As far as I know, it’s definitely not that light.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I also thought so.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh……
 </p>
 <p>
  The shadows deepened on the floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Shadow Queen popped out from within.
 </p>
 <p>
  “A month of grounding is just a vacation. What kind of punishment is that? I heard rumors that a constellation who attacked a Constellation Candidate had their constellation level greatly reduced. It’s a fatal penalty for constellations.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Now that two constellations said so, it sounded believable.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who would have to intervene to reduce such a powerful punishment to a month of grounding?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “For that……”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It would have to be Administrator-class, right? To reduce the punishment related to constellations……]
 </p>
 <p>
  The two carefully speculated in response to Seong Jihan’s question.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Administrator-class, there aren’t many candidates for that.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Just White, Black, and Green.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among them, the one always doing suspicious things was clearly Green.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But this time, it doesn’t seem to be them.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Wasn’t it Green who told Seong Jihan how to become a temporary Administrator because they wanted to somehow prevent the Red Administrator from becoming a permanent Administrator over them?
 </p>
 <p>
  Martial God also had no reason to help them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather than that,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Void side that keeps giving fire attribute bonuses to humanity is suspicious……’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan crossed his arms, carefully considered it, then suddenly thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm…… But do I really need to rack my brain over this?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I can just ask the person directly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m going to the training room for a bit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Training room?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, to ask the owner of the arena. Well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the 4th in the Void, he should know something.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No…… If you go to the training room, can you always meet the arena’s owner?”
 </p>
 <p>
  To the Shadow Queen’s question, Seong Jihan lightly replied.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If I say I’ll destroy the place, he shows up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, it’s fastest to ask the person directly. I’ll be back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  And so, in the training room he entered,
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ve come.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…… Wow, you were here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The arena’s owner was already there waiting before he even called.

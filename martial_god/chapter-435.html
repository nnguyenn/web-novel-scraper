  Chapter 435
 </p>
 <p>
  The World Tree Ignition Device and the Black Seal Box.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan examined and experimented with the two EX-grade items in the training hall.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the various attempts, the most meaningful was attaching them together.
 </p>
 <p>
  The closer the two items got to each other, the thicker the void energy they emitted.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The quality of the void was quite high.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan touched his left face.
 </p>
 <p>
  The crack on his face, which had grown larger than when he first entered here.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the past, it could still be seen as a wound somehow, but now there was a clear violet gap firmly in place between the faces.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Just absorbing what was emitted from there did this much……’
 </p>
 <p>
  Just by absorbing the energy emitted by the EX-grade items, the void on his face clearly developed compared to before.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps it was because the Black Administrator directly created the items.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had dealt with a lot of void energy so far, but the precision was on a different level.
 </p>
 <p>
  So even just absorbing this from the side, the void on his face increased.
 </p>
 <p>
  Furthermore,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I haven’t grasped it clearly yet, but the precise void seems to transcend spatial constraints……’
 </p>
 <p>
  The World Tree Ignition Device that could burn the World Tree on Earth and retrieve the power no matter where he was.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the Black Seal Box that completely cut off exchanges with the outside.
 </p>
 <p>
  Both items, although in different directions, were related to the control of space.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But it’s still only at the speculation stage. To clearly produce results, I need to absorb more void……’
 </p>
 <p>
  However, there was a limit to development.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Now, just absorbing from the side is not enough.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh swoosh……
 </p>
 <p>
  The violet energy emitted from the two attached items, like before.
 </p>
 <p>
  But this could no longer strengthen Seong Jihan’s power.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, it was time to take one more step forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Should I just absorb this into my face’s void processor?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought so while looking at the World Tree Ignition Device.
 </p>
 <p>
  He wasn’t going to press it anyway, contrary to their wishes.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he put it in the void processor and absorbed it, the void would develop much more than now.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If the power becomes too strong, the current balance might be broken.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The void processor and the Red Administrator’s hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  The two powers transplanted into Seong Jihan’s body originally had the Administrator’s hand in the upper hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  But as he was sealed and the void processor developed this time, the power relationship was becoming similar.
 </p>
 <p>
  But if he put the two EX items into the void processor and strengthened it here,
 </p>
 <p>
  The power could drastically shift towards the void processor.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘For now, I don’t need such excessive void, so let’s not put the items in.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If he recklessly upgraded the void processor, a situation he couldn’t handle might arise.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to put them into the crack on his face not now, but when he needed more power.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Inventory.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan put the two EX-grade items into his inventory and left the training hall.
 </p>
 <p>
  In fact, there were many other things to train here besides this.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘For now, I need to reach level 600 first.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Because the most important thing right now was to reach level 600 and go up to Challenger 6.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  A Challenger game matching no different from usual.
 </p>
 <p>
  [All opposing players die.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The game ends.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who lightly swept away the enemies, frowned when no level-up message appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The level really isn’t rising. At this rate, I won’t even reach 600 in this tournament.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s second tournament, less than a week away.
 </p>
 <p>
  In fact, since he had to go to Challenger 5 for the Great Constellations to participate, the chance for them to participate this time was practically gone.
 </p>
 <p>
  But since Seong Jihan’s leveling speed couldn’t get any faster, it seemed he had to set the standard to Challenger 7 instead of 6 now.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Hey, it’s not easy to level up at that level originally……
 </p>
 <p>
  – But if it’s Challenger 7, up to what constellation level can participate? Can someone interpret the participation guidelines?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Up to constellation level 9 can participate, but the number of spots is limited. 20 percent?
 </p>
 <p>
  – If it’s 20 percent, the competition will be fierce;
 </p>
 <p>
  The arena tournament with the Red Hand as the prize.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Ashoka sealed the hand in the last tournament, it was rather good for the participants.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it was Seong Jihan who couldn’t use Total Annihilation due to the sealed hand, even constellation level 8 would be a good match.
 </p>
 <p>
  And level 9 was expected to be able to win sufficiently.
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  – If level 9 participates, will the Cosmic Demon win after all?
 </p>
 <p>
  – There are so many strong ones at level 9, I don’t know why only that name comes up;
 </p>
 <p>
  – No, that guy is that much of a monster……
 </p>
 <p>
  – Has he ever been defeated? The Cosmic Demon.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the person picked as the winning candidate among constellation level 9 was none other than Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Cosmic Demon who, together with the Wandering Martial God, drove the constellations of the universe into fear.
 </p>
 <p>
  His notoriety of landing on a planet with a single sword and sweeping everything away was so well-known.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the level 9 constellations, he was one of the most famous.
 </p>
 <p>
  – But there’s no guarantee that he will show up. There are only 20 percent of spots, so won’t the level 9 constellations also apply in droves this time? If you lose in the competition, you’re out.
 </p>
 <p>
  – But what criteria do they use to select the tournament participants?
 </p>
 <p>
  – I heard it’s first-come, first-served?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Oh…… If it’s first-come, first-served, he really might not show up?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Even if the skills differ among level 9, the speed of submitting the application will be fair lol
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan fell into thought while looking at the content of the alien chat window.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘First-come, first-served…… It’s tricky to face Dongbang Sak now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Dongbang Sak’s current identity was Martial God’s disciple,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought he possessed martial arts far superior to Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meeting that transcendent martial artist in the tournament already would be a loss.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I will end the broadcast here today.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked around the chat that was actively coming up related to the tournament, then turned off BattleTube for now.
 </p>
 <p>
  The tournament, which was less than a few days away.
 </p>
 <p>
  If Dongbang Sak participated in this, he had to thoroughly prepare.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan came out of the room thinking about this match like that,
 </p>
 <p>
  [……Jihan. You. What’s wrong with your face?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jiah, who was floating in the living room, looked at Seong Jihan’s face with a stiff voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The void has become too strong…… The cracks have grown too.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, this is the result of training. I gained some power.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [……To say you gained some power, it looks like it will break at any moment.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “This?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Tap. Tap.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan pointed to his cracked face and replied nonchalantly.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
 </p>
 <p>
  “Break soon? It will last a year?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [A year isn’t soon?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “A year is plenty of time. Everything will be over before then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The conflict with Martial God and dealing with the fire of the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was convinced that all of this would end within a year.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  So even if the power of the void processor became stronger and his body couldn’t last a full year, it didn’t really matter.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Everything will be over…… Then, will that face and void disappear too? What will happen to your body?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, that. If I grow like now and control this void, it will be fine, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [……What if the growth fails?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Growth failing, don’t make such an impossible assumption. Rather than that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He smiled and changed the subject.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  His finger pointed to Seong Jiah’s lock.
 </p>
 <p>
  “When are you going to unlock that lock, sis? The Beginner’s Arena is over too. Why don’t you return to being human now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [……I was going to, but I still have some things to do with this body.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What things? Seah is also world rank 2 now. Is there a need to support her more?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s not related to Seah.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Then Seong Jiah stared at Seong Jihan blankly.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it’s not related to Seah……
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t tell me it’s me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yeah.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you see some prophecy with your divine eye?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s not the divine eye, but I did see something.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [……You collapsed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jiah continued in a gloomy voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your face was engulfed by the void, and your body was burned by fire. You tried to suppress the power you couldn’t handle, but it eventually exploded…… You couldn’t surpass the limit.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm. Where did that happen?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I’m not sure either. But, above your face, various weapons were twinkling in the air……]
 </p>
 <p>
  Was she talking about the Constellation relics?
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, it would be Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If I exploded there, it’s fine.”
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  [What…… What’s fine? You disappeared!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “That star is where Martial God lives. It’s enough if I poured out all my power there.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [……Then what will you do next? Your face was engulfed by the void, and your body burned and disappeared!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well…… There are ways.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan said with a calm face.
 </p>
 <p>
  In fact, he had never thought about that ‘way’ even once so far.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You think I’m crazy enough to self-destruct there? I can’t die until I use up all the GP I’ve earned so far.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I see……]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. I have to live arrogantly as the world’s number 1 before I go…… There are ways to revive, so don’t worry.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [What are the ways then?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have something called Stat Eternity, so I can recover with that. You’ll know the details later when you see it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan deflected Seong Jiah’s interrogation like that and pointed to her lock again.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So don’t worry about me and use the key.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [……I’ll use that a bit later.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, really. If you can’t unlock it later……”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hey, I have my ways too, just like you?]
 </p>
 <p>
  His sister countered with the same words.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was at a loss for words for a moment,
 </p>
 <p>
  [So stop talking about the key. I’m going.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where are you going?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Bathroom.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re a rock, sis.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [……Just roughly know and let it slide!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jiah’s stone statue floated up and quickly entered the bedroom.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘……Phew, when will she really use the key?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Isn’t it more comfortable to live as a rock at this point?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought so and frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was grateful for her intention to stay as the Witch of the Void to help him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But honestly, it won’t be of much help in terms of power…… I wish she would just become human quickly and put her mind at ease.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking at the opponents he was currently facing, Seong Jiah’s constellation authority couldn’t have a big impact on the overall situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather than trying to help with that power, he wished she would quickly become human and be at peace……
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well…… If our positions were reversed, I would have done the same.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought so and watched the spot where Seong Jiah had left for a moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  Without realizing it, a small sigh escaped.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Martial God’s Star, Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dongbang Sak. Apply for the tournament. Bring back Seong Jihan’s hand from there.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood. Oh Martial God.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak, kneeling before Martial God, received the order and, took out a smartphone from his bosom.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm……”
 </p>
 <p>
  Beep. Beep.
 </p>
 <p>
  The old man narrowed his eyes and carefully moved his fingers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia, watching from the side, smirked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Dongbang Sak. You know how to apply, right? If you don’t know, should I help you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……Do you take me for a fool? Who can’t submit an application to the arena!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, it’s just that you look like an elder struggling to adapt to IT devices. I, as a young one, am trying to help.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Young? Pythia, you must be much older than me, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak stroked his beard and leisurely retorted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey. Not by much, okay?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Compared to Eve, the progenitor of humanity, I’m too young.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, my face is younger!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Haha. Can you judge by the outer skin?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Dongbang Sak waved his right hand once, his robe fluttered, and his body instantly shrank.
 </p>
 <p>
  Along with that, his beard disappeared, his wrinkles smoothed out, and,
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak’s appearance transformed from a robust old man to a young child in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can become a child like this with a single gesture.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh…… It changes in an instant. But you’re kind of cute?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was good-looking since I was young.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, as he habitually tried to stroke his chin with his hand,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah……”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak unknowingly dropped his smartphone.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kwajik!
 </p>
 <p>
  The smartphone, shattered on the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the cracked screen, the arena application screen was displayed.

  Chapter 439
 </p>
 <p>
  Hearing the topic shift in this direction, the Shadow Queen looked at Seong Jiah with an expression of incomprehension.
 </p>
 <p>
  “When you live life, there are times when you have to part ways, so why are you making such a fuss?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [This is originally one of the topics people find most entertaining. It’s perfect for nitpicking and gossiping.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, is that so? I invited you because you’re a constellation, so I’m sorry. I’ll designate divorce as a forbidden word in the chat window.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Forget it. Even if you make it a forbidden word, everyone will find a way around it. Just let them chatter.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I guess. Then let’s just watch the game.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jiah answered nonchalantly, the Shadow Queen quickly enlarged the game screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  There, the dragon clan members who each had two heads were in a standoff.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I will carry out the Lord’s order.]DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  Once again, one side was exploding.
 </p>
 <p>
  And towards the surviving dragon, once again flew bits of blood and flesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  They gathered next to the 2 heads and began wriggling to create something again.
 </p>
 <p>
  -2 heads exploded, so does it become 2+2?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Later on, it’ll just have a crazy number of heads lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -But if the number of heads increases, how much stronger will it get?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh… This time it only increased by 1.
 </p>
 <p>
  Splat!
 </p>
 <p>
  After the fusion ended, the dragon’s head.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Shadow Queen narrowed her eyes seeing that.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s fortunate that it didn’t increase to 4 heads, but I don’t know how much stronger it got with just 1 more.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [How much stronger, you ask? It became about 30% more powerful than when it had 2 heads.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You can figure that out?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I can discern it to a certain extent.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Saying that, Seong Jiah pointed to the brightly shining Divine Eye on her forehead.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh… Then when it originally went from 1 head to 2, it also got 30% stronger?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [At that time, it was around 40-50%. There were differences in mana increase rate between individuals.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then even with 3 heads, the power of a level 9 constellation hasn’t doubled.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [If an individual that got 50% stronger gained another 30%, it’s close to doubling.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Shadow Queen’s eyes sparkled as she looked at the Divine Eye calculating the increase in power.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jiah, would you be willing to appear as a fixed guest only for this tournament?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Fixed? You want me to keep appearing on this?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I told your brother I would analyze the constellations’ powers and let him know, and I think it would be more accurate seeing it through your Divine Eye.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ah… If that’s the case, alright.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The opponent Seong Jihan would have to fight after the finals was, no matter how you look at it, that fused dragon clan.
 </p>
 <p>
  In order to analyze the enemy’s combat power for her younger brother, Seong Jiah accepted the Queen’s suggestion.
 </p>
 <p>
  And like that, the tournament’s round of 64 proceeded.
 </p>
 <p>
  [4 heads… It’s 20%. The rate of increase is gradually weakening.]
 </p>
 <p>
  -Phew, that’s a relief since it’s 4 heads.
 </p>
 <p>
  -I thought the heads might increase exponentially lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -Still, since it became way stronger than a level 9 constellation, we can’t let our guard down.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yeah, even if the rate of power increase is lower, by the time it reaches the finals it’ll probably be a monstrous dragon.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the tournament rounds went up, the heads of the dragon clan members were increasing exactly by 1 each time.
 </p>
 <p>
  People were relieved seeing this number, saying the worst-case scenario had been avoided.
 </p>
 <p>
  And as the matches progressed rapidly, the tournament soon entered the round of 16.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow, they’re all dragon clan??
 </p>
 <p>
  -Not a single other constellation.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yeah, the other constellations couldn’t win against the dragons with increased heads.
 </p>
 <p>
  -They couldn’t handle level 9 constellations getting stronger;
 </p>
 <p>
  By the round of 16, besides the dragon clan, all the other constellations had been annihilated.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Shadow Queen frowned seeing this.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Looks like it’ll reach the finals within today.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Today’s not the issue, won’t it take just a few hours? Since it ends quickly when it’s between dragons who self-destruct.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right. Setting up the arena takes more time…”
 </p>
 <p>
  With the dragon clan dominating the tournament, the Shadow Queen’s broadcast had already become a wreck.
 </p>
 <p>
  When dragons met each other, they would talk about the Lord and self-destruct in less than 3 minutes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even when a dragon met another constellation, the dragon clan members who had gotten stronger with more heads easily overwhelmed their opponents.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Even if I get an investment, I don’t know if I can pay back the loans…’
 </p>
 <p>
  While the Shadow Queen was foreseeing her own overwhelming deficit like that,
 </p>
 <p>
  -Now it’ll be 6 heads, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Round of 16 is 6, quarterfinals 7, semifinals 8, finals 9…
 </p>
 <p>
  -So in the end, Seong Jihan fights against 9 heads? Lol
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers, instead of being interested in the battles, were counting how many heads there would be.
 </p>
 <p>
  The fights would end in an instant anyway with one side self-destructing.
 </p>
 <p>
  They decided to at least gauge what kind of opponent Seong Jihan would fight against in the end.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan hasn’t shown up yet?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yeah. He’s staying in the training room for a long time this round.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… He might get forcibly summoned before I can even hand over the analysis data. Today’s matches will end in an instant.”
 </p>
 <p>
  What a waste after preparing it.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the Shadow Queen was lamenting,
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">

 </div>
 <p>
  On the game screen, heads were exploding like before.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’ll be 6 now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Since all of them increased by 1 head so far, it would be the same this time too.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Shadow Queen spoke indifferently while watching the blood and flesh fly towards the living dragon, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  […Huh? No, something’s strange?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The scene that unfolded next was a bit different from before.
 </p>
 <p>
  The remains of the exploded opposing dragon wrapped around the 5 heads.
 </p>
 <p>
  These also all began to fuse together.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This fusion is taking quite some time?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “It is. It bought time for Seong Jihan to return.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Why isn’t he coming, I don’t know.]
 </p>
 <p>
  About an hour had passed since the heads were disassembled and lumped together like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  In the place where the dragon clan’s heads were.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was a head that felt completely different from the original settled in.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Rather than a dragon’s head…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The appearance seems closer to a serpent?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike the previous dragons, the elongated dark red head resembled a snake in shape.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The match has ended.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The winner is ‘Seven-Horned Blue Dragon’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  With that message popping up as the fusion finished completely.
 </p>
 <p>
  -This time it didn’t become 6 heads?
 </p>
 <p>
  -The appearance really doesn’t match;
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yeah, it doesn’t seem to fit with the dragon body.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But dragons are actually a type of lizard, so I thought the difference wouldn’t be that big… It looks quite unbalanced.
 </p>
 <p>
  -First of all, the color is weird lol. A blackish-red head with a blue dragon’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  While people were criticizing the new head for a long time saying it didn’t match,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  From the ceiling of the Shadow Queen’s broadcast studio.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So this is where you were.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan poked his head in.
 </p>
 <p>
  The golden tower located in Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching the tournament match, Pythia frowned seeing the changing appearance of the dragon clan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…That head is similar to the one My lord took out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The dragon whose heads kept increasing one by one, then evolved into a serpent’s head on the 6th one.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the serpentine shape that appeared there was familiar to Pythia as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because the serpent head Martial God had created back when he said he would look through her memories and swallowed her looked just like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why is that head there… Is what My lord used the Dragon Lord’s authority… Or…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What the, why is that damn snake head there?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Gilgamesh, who was merged with the tower and only had his head sticking out, shouted like that,
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia raised her hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, are you secretly peeking at my BattleTube again? I told you not to look!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Urk…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Smack!
 </p>
 <p>
  After smashing Gilgamesh’s head, Pythia tried to turn off the screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  But before she could end the BattleTube, Gilgamesh hurriedly shouted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wa-wait! Isn’t it strange? That the Dragon Lord and the snake have the same head!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…My lord can merely also summon a snake’s head, that’s not his real head.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you saying? I’m the first human he made a contract with. His original form was a serpent!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “When he saved me, he had the form of the Blood Clan!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That was him disguising himself in that form! When he revealed his true colors at the time of the primordial contract, his original form was a serpent!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Gilgamesh passionately argued, Pythia scoffed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, that fraudulent contract? Saying it like that makes it sound even more fake. In order to make a false contract with you, he must have proceeded with the contract in a false form!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Guh…! That’s not it. That’s the truth!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Smack!
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia hit Gilgamesh once more.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stop rolling your eyes and hurry up and fully merge with the tower. There aren’t many days left until we go to Earth now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you trying to do…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You don’t need to know.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia said that and turned off the BattleTube screen before disappearing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Left alone in the tower like that, Gilgamesh pondered deeply.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The head the dragon clan fused into is exactly the same as Martial God’s head. Martial God, could he have had a connection with the dragon clan or the Lord…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh tried to recall his memories.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Martial God always hid his face in darkness,
 </p>
 <p>
  The form revealed at the time of the primordial contract was a blackish-red serpent’s head.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was definitely that shape.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should let that descendant brat know…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh, who had arbitrarily decided Seong Jihan was his descendant,
 </p>
 <p>
  rolled his eyes this way and that.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  Since Pythia had left her spot, now was the best opportunity to send a message.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whirr…
 </p>
 <p>
  From the right hand part of his body merged with the golden tower, a cell phone popped out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  He swiftly grabbed the cell phone with his right hand and brought it inside the tower.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Seong Jihan. The serpent head that formed from the dragon clan fusing is identical to Martial God’s.]
 </p>
 <p>
  […You kept calling Martial God a snake, so that’s what his face hidden in darkness looked like?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. I made a contract with that face. Martial God’s origin may be related to the dragon clan. Be careful.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Got it.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [And Pythia said there aren’t many days left until she goes to Earth… You’ll have to prepare for that too.]
 </p>
 <p>
  While Gilgamesh was diligently conveying all the information he knew,
 </p>
 <p>
  Tap. Tap.
 </p>
 <p>
  The disappeared Pythia returned.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Gilgamesh. What… did you do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What can I even do in this state? I’m completely tied up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm…”
 </p>
 <p>
  She looked at Gilgamesh with suspicious eyes and sat down.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t mess around. I know everything.”
 </p>
 <p>
  What do you even know?
 </p>
 <p>
  He only sent a few texts.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Gilgamesh thought that, he acted calm on the outside.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How can I mess around in this state? Stop mocking me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Something’s fishy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She sat in her spot and turned the BattleTube back on.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even if I show you this, I’ll have to keep an eye on you next to me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmph, I’m grateful. It’ll relieve my boredom.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Like that, the two began watching Seong Jihan’s tournament together in an uncomfortable atmosphere.
 </p>
 <p>
  And.
 </p>
 <p>
  Splat. Splat…!
 </p>
 <p>
  On the tournament screen, dragon heads were exploding like usual.
 </p>
 <p>
  And.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Martial God’s head appeared again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s not My lord’s head, you know?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Smack!
 </p>
 <p>
  While Gilgamesh was getting beaten several times for calling the serpent head Martial God’s,
 </p>
 <p>
  The game had already progressed to the finals at super speed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The dragon clan, who stopped having their heads multiply into 2 or 3 even when they exploded each other’s heads after turning into serpent heads,
 </p>
 <p>
  In the finals, two dragon clans with the same blackish-red serpent heads were facing each other.
 </p>
 <p>
  And.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Lord shall descend.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The dragon clans who always said they would carry out the Lord’s order every time,
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally spoke of the true purpose ‘Descent’ after reaching the finals.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whirrrr…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, instead of exploding, the bodies of the two dragons that made it to the finals combined.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  The serpent heads that had a definite entity,
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead began to blur and become semi-transparent.
 </p>
 <p>
  -What the heck is this…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is the Dragon Lord descending??
 </p>
 <p>
  -Did they push in 128 dragons to do this ;;
 </p>
 <p>
  -No, isn’t this against the rules? Shouldn’t the arena regulate this?
 </p>
 <p>
  -If they were going to regulate it, wouldn’t they have done so from the start when 128 dragon clans entered. They’re in cahoots, aren’t they?
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers who heard about the Dragon Lord’s descent were outraged, asking if this made sense.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the arena showed no signs of stopping the tournament.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The tournament final match will begin.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as the final match ended, they were already summoning Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash! Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  The two beings summoned to the stage of the final match.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Blue Dragon ‘Seven-Horned Blue Dragon’ with the elongated serpent head.
 </p>
 <p>
  And Seong Jihan with the sealed red hand faced each other.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, a tiny human compared to the dragon.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looked up at it intently.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you the Dragon Lord?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s right. Although I couldn’t fully draw out my power, this body is more than enough to become an avatar.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… Is that head your original head?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Lord easily affirmed Seong Jihan’s question, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s right.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s your relationship with Martial God?”
 </p>
 <p>
  […Martial God? Why is he being brought up?]
 </p>
 <p>
  It couldn’t immediately understand Seong Jihan’s next question.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That guy’s head looked like that too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [What…]

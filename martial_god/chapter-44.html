   Chapter 44

 <p>
  “Uncle~ I saw you finished the game… You’re back?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, I’m here. Come in.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a gentle push, Yoon Seah entered. She looked much more relaxed than when she was hounded by reporters outside Sword Palace.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How’s the search for the Shadow Queen going? Got any leads?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m fairly certain that the dark elf with the black eyes you mentioned is suspicious. Actually, I’m convinced it’s her.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really? I couldn’t tell from the screen.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What I saw was different.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan narrated what he saw through the hole, and Yoon Seah’s eyes sparkled with intrigue.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So the view beyond the barrier was entirely different… Did you complete the quest then?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, I couldn’t provoke her. I’m planning to be more prepared before I do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, that’s a shame then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Hearing the quest wasn’t completed, Yoon Seah seemed a bit disappointed. She was about to leave when Seong Jihan stopped her.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah, wait.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hm?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You helped me find the Shadow Queen. So, tell me what favor you wanted to ask of me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well… It’s still not confirmed yet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s okay, I’m curious.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She hesitated for a moment, then finally said, “I was thinking… about moving.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Moving? Out of here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. I don’t want to live here anymore.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She glanced out of the room.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even if I don’t want to think about it, memories resurface, especially on days like today.”
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  It was evident who she was talking about. Even though Yoon Seah usually maintained a cheerful demeanor, now, looking at the house, she seemed melancholic.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded silently.
 </p>
 <p>
  The penthouse of Sword Palace, unnecessarily vast, with remnants of the Sword King’s presence everywhere, had always been a sore point.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the last interview of Sword King, it was clear that he won’t be returning to Korea.
 </p>
 <p>
  That meant, it was time to think about moving.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright, let’s move! I’ve earned some money recently, so it should be enough.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What? No need! You barely have money!”
 </p>
 <p>
  She was startled, and Seong Jihan looked amused.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah… I’m not that broke.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Haha! Never mind! Uncle, you’re broke. What’s there for me to take advantage of?”
 </p>
 <p>
  He chuckled, wondering how she thought he was so destitute.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Listen… I made some money at the auction. It’s better to invest in real estate than leaving it in the bank, right? Right! Real estate! Gangnam! Gangnam is always profitable!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah saying this made Seong Jihan remember his past life.
 </p>
 <p>
  Destruction took place everywhere and after Korea kept finishing last in the East Asian League and was driven to the brink, the land in Gangnam became worthless.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, Korea won’t fail this time.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Since he’d regressed, Korea wouldn’t keep finishing last like it did before.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But if you’re using your money, why ask me? Just buy it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, I’m still a minor, and I need a representative. Plus, I’d have to check out houses. You’ve been so busy lately; I felt bad asking.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He ruffled her hair gently.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s there to feel bad about? We’re family.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Still, being family doesn’t mean taking everything for granted.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “….”
 </p>
 <p>
  Mentioning ‘family,’ a shadow momentarily crossed her bright face. It was clear whom she was thinking of.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘We need to move as soon as possible.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, too, didn’t want to stay here any longer, even more so now.
 </p>
 <p>
  He playfully flexed his arms and said, “Anything you need, just let me know.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh, so showy… Uncle, you’re just going to live off me again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your house? It’s our house. Ahem… I’ll contact the administration office tomorrow. Should we start looking at some options?”
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah was quick to act.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before he knew it, she had already contacted a real estate agent and they were on their way to view a house.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I think it’s better to invest in a house than to keep money lying around,” she reasoned.
 </p>
 <p>
  She was introduced to luxury homes, looking to invest part of the 50 billion she received from the Sword King.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first one was a high-end apartment located by the Han River in Gangnam.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is… this place really 80 billion won?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, it’s a great place. Newly built, with a fantastic view of the Han River. The total area is around 80 pyeong.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [TL/N: A pyeong is a Korean unit of area and floorspace, equal to a 36 square Korean feet.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The apartment, located on the 30th floor, indeed seemed worth the hefty price tag. The luxurious interior, the expansive area, and the perfect view of the Han River added to its appeal.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Many famous players, as well as celebrities, live here. It’s a place that ensures privacy. The price is lower than the market rate since the owner wants to sell it quickly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  While it was a good house from a common perspective, Yoon Seah, accustomed to the vastness of Sword Palace, felt the apartment was too cramped. The living room, which was supposed to have a great view of the Han River, was barely half the size of her current room at the penthouse.
 </p>
 <p>
  She whispered, “This… is 80 billion?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The agent, sensing a potential sale, eagerly asked, “How do you find it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow! It’s. Really. Nice,” Seah replied, but her tone wasn’t convincing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan sensed her dissatisfaction. ‘She seems to be experiencing a culture shock.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Remembering their spacious penthouse, he agreed that they needed a bigger place.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Although it’s nice, we would like to see other options,” Jihan said, shifting his gaze from the Han River.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  “Space is more important to us than the view. If Seah becomes a player, we’ll need room for the BattleNet connector.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The agent, intrigued, asked, “Is Ms. Yoon Seah going to receive a Gift soon?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Probably,” she replied.
 </p>
 <p>
  The agent, clearly a fan, said, “Your entire family has impressive gifts. And with your uncle being so remarkable!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You know me too?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course! I’m a huge BattleNet fan. I even subscribed to Mr. Seong Jihan’s channel. I watched you break the barrier yesterday.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He was genuinely surprised to meet a subscriber. Although he was popular in his past life, it was mostly in the U.S. This was his first encounter with a fan in Korea.
 </p>
 <p>
  The agent continued, “There are spacious houses in Ilwon-dong preferred by players. Would you be open to those?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright, I’d like that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then I’ll guide you there.”
 </p>
 <p>
  While they were on the move in the real estate agent’s car, a phone ring echoed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan received a call. It was from Park Yoonsik, the BattleNet Department Manager.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He responded quickly, considering I messaged him this morning.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Jihan had messaged Park Yoonsik earlier, expecting to notify him before going on their house hunt. The reply came sooner than expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mr. Seong Jihan, this is Park Yoonsik from BattleNet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, Maager. How did your report go?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well… The administration has decided not to delay the ‘donation’ of Sword Palace any longer.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Public opinion hasn’t been favorable since the match with Japan, has it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Indeed. Though some still support the Sword King, after the devastating defeat, many have turned away.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The delay in the donation of the high-value Sword Palace was because of public sentiment.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the government accepted the donation, people would see it as giving up on persuading the Sword King. Until yesterday, the Sword King was incredibly popular in Korea. But now…
 </p>
 <p>
  “And… the sense of betrayal is immense.”ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels
 </p>
 <p>
  “I hope their anger doesn’t turn towards us.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Most people see you and Yoon Seah as victims. Of course, some criticize you, but they’re a minority.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s expected.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoonsik asked, “So, may we announce the donation of Sword Palace?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, Seah, is that alright?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. That’s why we’re moving.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it. We’ll proceed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After ending the call with Yoonsik, the real estate agent who was driving asked, “You’re donating Sword Palace?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, that’s also why we’re moving.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow, that’s remarkable. I would have held onto such a property no matter what.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jihan gave a wry smile. To many, donating a top-tier building in Gangnam, especially not selling but donating it to the government, would seem insane. But for Jihan, who knew the future, it was a necessary action.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Still, with your abilities and Miss Seah soon getting a Gift, you can buy a building like that again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who knows if I’ll get a gift? It’s all random.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The agent laughed, “Given the lineage of Miss Yoon Seah, she’s bound to get one. With the Priestess, the Sword King, and even Mr. Seong, everyone possesses incredible abilities.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s purely random,” Seah tried to dismiss it, but Jihan could see the hope and expectation in her eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘She’s hoping too much.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Jihan’s face hardened slightly.

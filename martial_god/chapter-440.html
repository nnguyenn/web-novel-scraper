  Chapter 440
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’re referring to the Wandering Martial God, is that correct?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Lord questioned Seong Jihan as if he couldn’t understand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’re saying he looked exactly like me? Impossible.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Lord moved his serpentine head.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This form is unique to me among the Dragon Clan. The appearance of Martial God you saw must be some inferior imitation.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Lord asserted that there’s no way Martial God’s head could resemble his own.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Since I haven’t actually seen Martial God’s head myself, it’s ambiguous to refute that claim.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The information Gilgamesh provided in the community about the connection between Martial God and the Dragon Lord was all Seong Jihan had.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the Dragon Lord denied it, there wasn’t much more Seong Jihan, who hadn’t actually seen it, could say.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  “Still, it’s strange. It looked exactly the same as what I saw?”
 </p>
 <p>
  For now, Seong Jihan tried insisting as if he had truly seen it himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed unlikely Gilgamesh would say they were identical if the resemblance was only slight.
 </p>
 <p>
  Furthermore.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I don’t say I saw it directly, Gilgamesh who provided the information might get interrogated.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t that Seong Jihan particularly trusted Gilgamesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  But it also felt wrong to just abandon him like this when he was providing information in his own way.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here, it would be better to pretend he saw it himself and keep Gilgamesh out of suspicion for now.
 </p>
 <p>
  So Seong Jihan took it a step further.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. Could it be that you were cloned or something back in your pet days?”
 </p>
 <p>
  […What did you just say?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Cloned? It’s possible, isn’t it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [No, before that. What… days did you say?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, pet? I heard you were the pet of the Red Administrator. The Sun King was Red’s disciple.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […]
 </p>
 <p>
  Hiss…
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s blunt use of the term ‘pet’, the Dragon Lord was at a loss for words.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow, he’s saying that to the Dragon Lord;;
 </p>
 <p>
  -But was the Dragon Lord really the Red Administrator’s pet?
 </p>
 <p>
  -There were rumors the Administrator rode him around but everyone thought no way, who would ride a Great Constellation;;
 </p>
 <p>
  -I’m also hearing for the first time that the Sun King was his disciple.
 </p>
 <p>
  The alien viewers watching the final match seemed unaware of the details Seong Jihan revealed and were rapidly sharing this information.
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers had already gathered in droves to see the final match and how the sealed Red hand would turn out.
 </p>
 <p>
  At this rate, it seemed the theory ‘Dragon Lord = Administrator’s Pet’ would become established fact in the BattleNet community.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan glanced at the heated chat window reactions with one eye,
 </p>
 <p>
  [I was going to just cut off your arms and let you live. But you’re bringing death upon yourself.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The body of the Blue Dragon the Lord had descended into began to burn.
 </p>
 <p>
  The flames that instantly engulfed the body of the level 9 constellation left only the serpent’s neck.
 </p>
 <p>
  And spread in all directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  [No… Your sin is too great to be paid for with just your death. Your race will have to take responsibility as well.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re going to hold humanity responsible just because I mentioned you were a pet in the past? How narrow-minded are you for a Lord?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Saying that, Seong Jihan smirked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, I guess. Since you lived a long life as a pet, you might be narrow-minded. I’ll acknowledge that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Hearing those words, the flames grew more intense.
 </p>
 <p>
  Being called the Administrator’s pet seemed to definitely strike a nerve with the Dragon Lord.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He’s getting angry, but not hastily unleashing his power.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though he got upset at Seong Jihan’s provocation, the Dragon Lord didn’t emotionally lash out at him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather, while burning up the Blue Dragon’s body,
 </p>
 <p>
  He was steadily taking over the inside of the arena with his flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now the opponent was just a long serpent’s neck amidst the flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the mana emanating from there was much more powerful than when it had a body.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I don’t think I can shake him up more with pet remarks… I should take the initiative.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan thought that and took out the Phoenix Spear from his inventory,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Great Constellation ‘Sun King’ asks if the Wandering Martial God’s head is really identical to the Dragon Lord’s.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sun King, who had become his sponsoring constellation, suddenly sent a message.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, completely identical. That blackish-red serpent head, Martial God had it too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the fact that all he actually saw was a single line of text from Gilgamesh, Seong Jihan affirmed it with a calm face.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sun King immediately responded to this.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Great Constellation ‘Sun King’ promises to grant you immense rewards if you find out the location of the Wandering Martial God.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [He also promises that if you leave the ‘Solar Core’ where Martial God is, he will absolutely never touch the player or humanity.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sun King, no longer having any intention of hiding the purpose of the Solar Core, told him to leave it where Martial God was.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, the Dragon Lord, whose head shape was identical, was certain his head was unique and that Martial God’s was an inferior imitation.
 </p>
 <p>
  The third party, the Sun King, seemed to know something about Martial God’s true identity instead.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Could this guy really have been cloned or something?’
 </p>
 <p>
  When he asked the Dragon Lord earlier if he was cloned during his pet days, it was just to provoke him.
 </p>

 <p>
  But the Sun King was reacting strangely.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan quietly looked at the message the Sun King sent,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Great Constellation ‘Sun King’ tells you to survive until then and bestows the ‘Blessing of the Sun’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Intense light poured out from the sun brightly illuminating the arena.
 </p>
 <p>
  That sunlight began to gather directly towards Seong Jihan standing in the arena.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, the firepower gathered in the Phoenix Spear became even more powerful.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This has quite a buff effect. Considering various factors, it should show an efficiency of about 20%.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sun King, who previously seemed like he would capture and kill Seong Jihan at any moment, suddenly became an ally.
 </p>
 <p>
  Was it because the Dragon Lord stole the spotlight from him?
 </p>
 <p>
  Or was it because of the fact that the Wandering Martial God’s true appearance resembled the Dragon Lord?
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sun King’s true intentions couldn’t be clearly discerned yet, but Seong Jihan decided to make good use of the buff he gave for now.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Phoenix Spear burned even more powerfully, the Dragon Lord’s gaze turned towards the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  More precisely, towards the sun.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Sun King… Are you trying to intervene in the Space Arena? The price will be hefty.]
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how much of a Great Constellation he was, giving a buff in the arena’s final match wasn’t an easy thing to do.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Lord pointed this out, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Rather than watching the beast raised covet its master’s possession, it would be right for the disciple to carry on the master’s accomplishments.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sun King’s voice was heard from the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  At those words clearly referring to the Dragon Lord as a beast,
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Lord’s flames grew even fiercer.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hah… Disciple? The one who was no different from a slave is beautifying his memories.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Look who’s talking. The sight of the snake groveling on the ground, fawning over its master is still vivid in my eyes.]
 </p>
 <p>
  […When I become the Administrator, I will steal your light first.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, the Dragon Lord glared at Seong Jihan’s right arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Give me your arm and die, Seong Jihan.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as those words ended,
 </p>
 <p>
  The arena was instantly engulfed in enormous flames.
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  The golden tower located in Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia was frowning as she watched the final match of the tournament.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘How does Seong Jihan know that?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Just a moment ago, Pythia had argued with Gilgamesh about Martial God’s head.
 </p>
 <p>
  So when Seong Jihan revealed it right away in the final match, she felt suspicious.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Gilgamesh. Don’t tell me… you’re in contact with Seong Jihan?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia looked at Gilgamesh’s head with doubtful eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her hand was already raised above Gilgamesh’s head.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That damn descendant brat, why would he reveal it right away…!!’
 </p>
 <p>
  No, it hasn’t even been that long since I sent the text and he’s already spilling the beans?
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh gnashed his teeth inwardly, but for now decided to feign ignorance as much as possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [It looked exactly the same as what I saw?]
 </p>
 <p>
  On the BattleTube screen, Seong Jihan was also calmly claiming he saw it himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How can I, with only a head left, be in contact with him! Look at that! Isn’t he saying he saw it directly!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “When would that guy have a chance to see My lord’s face?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How would I know that! Stop making absurd accusations and just hit me if you want to hit me!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia looked down at Gilgamesh with cold eyes, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yeah, completely identical. That blackish-red serpent head, Martial God had it too.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan on the screen kept talking as if he really saw it, her suspicion subsided slightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I’ll let it slide for now. But until we go to Earth, I’ll have to keep watching you right next to me from now on.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmph. Staying with me all the time… Do you like me that much? You’re worthy of being my first companion.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Companion? This crazy bastard, seriously… I’ll make that mouth disappear.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bam! Bam!
 </p>
 <p>
  While Pythia, whose eyes rolled back at the word companion, was determinedly beating Gilgamesh’s head,
 </p>
 <p>
  Hiss…
 </p>
 <p>
  [Wait a moment.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Behind Pythia’s back, Martial God’s figure appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  The red eyes in the darkness were always shining ominously,
 </p>
 <p>
  But today, the power it exuded was even more baleful.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah. Understood, My lord.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia stopped her punches and quickly knelt down.
 </p>
 <p>
  Martial God looked down at the two with haunting eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Who divulged information about my head.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Th-that’s…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [No, there’s no need to ask. I can just look and find out.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Hiss…
 </p>
 <p>
  From the darkness, a serpent’s head popped out.
 </p>
 <p>
  It swallowed Pythia first.
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Watching Martial God examine Pythia’s memories inside the serpent’s head,
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…They really look exactly the same.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Lord in the BattleTube screen Pythia had pulled up, and the serpent head Martial God summoned.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clearly their sizes were different, but their appearances were completely identical.
 </p>
 <p>
  To this extent, it wasn’t something the Dragon Lord should dismiss as an imitation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile,
 </p>
 <p>
  […You two, definitely had a conversation related to this.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Bam!
 </p>
 <p>
  After reading Pythia’s memories, Martial God spat her back out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then his two gazes turned towards Gilgamesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Gilgamesh. Was it you who informed him?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Hah! With only a head left, how could I have informed him?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lying to someone who reads memories,
 </p>
 <p>
  Would be quickly exposed anyway,
 </p>
 <p>
  But Gilgamesh tried to resist as much as possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  He wasn’t someone who would go easy on him even if he told the truth.
 </p>
 <p>
  So he decided to be stubborn to the end.
 </p>
 <p>
  Furthermore,
 </p>
 <p>
  [That… I will know once I look…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. Swallow me up then. Let me get out of here for a bit!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh, who had become one with the tower,
 </p>
 <p>
  Wanted to be swallowed by that guy and escape from here even for a moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  Martial God’s serpent wouldn’t be able to devour the entire tower, so even if it ate him, it would only take out Gilgamesh’s body to examine.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, it might just eat his head,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Anyway, I want to separate from this damn tower.’
 </p>
 <p>
  From Gilgamesh’s perspective, having become one with the Babel Tower, he just wanted to get out of here for now.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment,
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia, who had fallen to the ground, struggled to get up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “M-My lord. But if his fusion with the tower breaks… It will take time to combine them again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [How much longer will it take?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “It will likely take at least two more months…”
 </p>
 <p>
  […]
 </p>
 <p>
  If he examined Gilgamesh’s memories, it would delay the achievement of his grand scheme by two more months.
 </p>
 <p>
  Two months.
 </p>
 <p>
  A short period, if it could be called short.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Dragon Lord and Sun King… Now that the two Great Constellations have begun to intervene in earnest, time is of the essence.’
 </p>
 <p>
  For Martial God, he couldn’t afford to wait even that long.
 </p>
 <p>
  [We can’t delay it that much.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Th-then…”
 </p>
 <p>
  […Let’s leave Gilgamesh alone for now. But he is definitely the culprit. Pythia. Keep watching him.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes… I will make sure such an unfortunate incident never happens again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Still, letting it slide is too much for the sin he committed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a wave of Martial God’s hand,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Wrinkles instantly appeared on Gilgamesh’s face.
 </p>
 <p>
  And his hair began to fall to the floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I strip you of a portion of your immortality. Gilgamesh. Experience the aging you so desperately tried to avoid.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wha…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Pythia. Then keep watching him.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Hiss…
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, Martial God disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia stared at the spot where he vanished for a moment, then turned her gaze towards Gilgamesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this brief moment,
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh, who had the appearance of a middle-aged man, had already become an old man.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ve shriveled up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Th-this can’t be. I have the authority of life…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait, you were bald? No wonder your hair was thinning.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wh-what… Me? That’s absurd!”
 </p>
 <p>
  To Gilgamesh who denied reality,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia conjured up a mirror.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ll know if you look. Your hair all fell out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Th-this is… because of the curse of aging!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you saying? Do all old people go bald? Dongbang Sak had lots of hair.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Th-that guy is different! If I wasn’t tied up, I would have hair!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “From now on, only sponsor bald people. They seem to be your descendants.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Guhhh…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  At those words, the face of the old man Gilgamesh crumpled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, gross. I feel a bit bad hitting an old man?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia scoffed at him and pulled up the BattleTube screen again.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the battlefield of the arena filled with only flames,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… He’s still alive.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was holding his own against the Dragon Lord.

  Chapter 441
 </p>
 <p>
  From the round of 256, the Dragon Lord descended by fusing the level 9 dragon clan members.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before the descent, when Seong Jiah estimated the power of the Seven-Horned Blue Dragon that participated in the finals,
 </p>
 <p>
  She had calculated it to be about 3-4 times stronger than the previous level 9 constellations.
 </p>
 <p>
  “And now that the Dragon Lord has descended on top of that, it must be much stronger…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s right. After the Dragon Lord’s descent, even my eyes can no longer judge how much stronger the mana has become. It’s definitely much stronger than when it was the Blue Dragon, but…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “But why is your younger brother enduring so well?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Shadow Queen looked at the screen with uncomprehending eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  The inside of the arena, where only the Dragon Lord’s neck was floating, was already engulfed in bright red flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Space Arena’s arena had already melted away.
 </p>
 <p>
  The spectator seats were also completely swallowed by the flames, and all that could be seen on the screen was fire.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside there, Seong Jihan was standing calmly without even a scorch on his clothes.
 </p>
 <p>
  [After going through the trouble of descending, is this all?]
 </p>
 <p>
  […That hand is annoying.]
 </p>
 <p>
  At the Dragon Lord’s words, the Shadow Queen enlarged the screen to focus on Seong Jihan’s hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  There, all of the Dragon Lord’s flames were being sucked into the back of his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah. Even though the Administrator’s hand is sealed, it seems to be controlling the dragon flames.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yeah. And the sealed red hand that had its eyes closed is wriggling a bit.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is the Dragon Lord’s fire instead becoming a medium to release the seal on the Administrator’s hand?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It might be.]
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how much of a Great Constellation the Dragon Lord was,
 </p>
 <p>
  As long as he used fire as his main weapon, he couldn’t deal effective damage to Seong Jihan who possessed the Administrator’s hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  A Great Constellation who failed to become the Administrator couldn’t surpass the Administrator’s authority after all.
 </p>
 <p>
  -When the Dragon Lord descended I thought the game was over…
 </p>
 <p>
  -This guy is nothing special?
 </p>
 <p>
  -I guess the Administrator is definitely above Great Constellations. It’s even providing firepower to the sealed hand lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -But how did Ashoka seal that? Even the Dragon Lord can’t do anything about it;
 </p>
 <p>
  -Right, come to think of it, isn’t Ashoka the strongest? ;;)
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers who had been worried that Seong Jihan might be in danger when the Dragon Lord descended,
 </p>
 <p>
  Were now watching the match with relief as the Dragon Lord’s flames couldn’t constrain Seong Jihan at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But the dragons that appeared in the round of 256 look cooler than the Lord… The Lord just has a snake head floating in the air and looks really lame.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Honestly, the other dragons look like they would be a better ride too lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -Lol the Administrator’s taste is really unique.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why is such a creepy snake a pet?
 </p>
 <p>
  -If you raise a snake, it’s kind of cute in its own way. Please respect people’s preferences.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Then would you raise a dragon or a snake?
 </p>
 <p>
  -A dragon, of course.
 </p>
 <p>
  The giant serpent head floating in the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to the other dragon clan members that participated in the tournament, its appearance itself was quite heterogeneous.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was certainly reasonable for the Dragon Lord to say that only he possessed this head.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the viewers were criticizing the snake’s appearance for a while like that,
 </p>
 <p>
  -But why is Seong Jihan still there?
 </p>
 <p>
  -He looks relaxed on the outside, but maybe he doesn’t have the power to attack.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Come to think of it, the spectator seats are all melted now and the black space outside is exposed; The firepower itself is crazy. Just enduring there might be impressive…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is he waiting for the seal to be released?
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan kept standing still in the flames, they began to worry if the situation was actually difficult for him.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your Stat Red increases by 1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is sweet.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In reality, it was the opposite.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking at his burning right hand, Seong Jihan thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Dragon flame is definitely an inferior version of Stat Red, but maybe because it’s the Dragon Lord’s, absorbing a lot of it increases my abilities.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Devouring the Dragon Lord’s flames, the stats that increased were already at 5.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was the result obtained just by standing still and extending his right hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to raise my stats as much as possible before the seal on the Administrator’s hand is released.’
 </p>
 <p>
  On top of the back of his hand, the red hand tried to wriggle and open its eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  But in Seong Jihan’s view, this level of firepower was still far from releasing the seal.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unless the Dragon Lord kept shooting flames at him for several days and nights.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You handle the Administrator’s abilities better than I expected.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The opponent wasn’t a fool either.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I admit that I cannot annihilate you with flames.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Gulp!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the serpent opened its mouth,
 </p>
 <p>
  The flames filling the arena were instantly sucked into it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, where are you going?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan hurriedly reached out his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, instead of entering the Dragon Lord’s mouth, the surrounding flames gathered towards Seong Jihan’s hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though they were the Dragon Lord’s, the flames followed Seong Jihan’s control more.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your Stat Red increases by 3.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So a total of 8 increased. In that case.’
 </p>

 <p>
  He wanted to fill it up to 10, what a shame.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was clicking his tongue,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Lord’s red eyes flashed as he saw the dragon flames not following his control.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You bastard… Were you devouring my flames?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. Thanks to that, my stats went up a bit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Why don’t you spit out what you ate.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so? I’m curious as to how you’ll make me do that. More importantly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who hadn’t attacked until now as he was absorbing the dragon flame, pointed the tip of his spear at the Dragon Lord.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, white flames, the sacred flame, began to rise from the tip of the spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m more curious if my Red authority will work on the Dragon Lord.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do you really think you can fully handle the Administrator’s authority?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “No. I’m still very lacking. But it should be enough to use on you, right? Your flames were eaten by me too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You still seem to have a lot left, give me more.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hah. You’ve gone mad!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Around the time the serpent’s eyes flashed at those words,
 </p>
 <p>
  Electricity rose in Seong Jihan’s white flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fundamental Divine Arts,
 </p>
 <p>
  Heavenly Dragon Thunder Fire
 </p>
 <p>
  Dragon Thunder
 </p>
 <p>
  Bzzt!
 </p>
 <p>
  The white lightning extending towards the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Thunder imbued with sacred flame instantly approached the serpent’s head.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Attacking me, the Dragon Lord, with fire…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Gulp!
 </p>
 <p>
  Just like a moment ago when he retracted the dragon flame,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Lord opened his mouth wide.
 </p>
 <p>
  As if he would just devour Seong Jihan’s flames right away.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Lord didn’t use any defensive magic.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This is…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Sizzle…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike when he retrieved his own dragon flames,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Thunder imbued with sacred flame wasn’t absorbed into the Dragon Lord’s mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bzzt…
 </p>
 <p>
  It was instantly releasing white electricity on his long head.
 </p>
 <p>
  [My power is being absorbed in reverse…]
 </p>
 <p>
  The sacred flame that had the effect of absorbing power.
 </p>
 <p>
  It sucked in the dragon flames, which were no different from an inferior ability of Red, the best.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The white flames held in its mouth gradually grew bigger.
 </p>
 <p>
  And soon spread all over the Dragon Lord’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Overwhelming a Great Constellation with fire…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is this a fake video?
 </p>
 <p>
  -I knew Seong Jihan controlled the red hand well, but this was clearly in a sealed state…
 </p>
 <p>
  -How can the Dragon Lord be inversely engulfed by those white flames?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Th-that is a descended state. A Great Constellation can’t exert his full power, that’s why this result is happening!
 </p>
 <p>
  -Then Seong Jihan isn’t even a constellation…
 </p>
 <p>
  The alien viewers doubted their eyes as they watched a constellation candidate overwhelm a Great Constellation with fire.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how much he had obtained some of the Administrator’s abilities,
 </p>
 <p>
  To overwhelm the ruler of the Dragon Clan, the Dragon Lord who was evaluated as the closest to the Administrator among the Great Constellations,
 </p>
 <p>
  And to do so with the Lord’s main weapon, fire, did that even make sense?
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Dragon Lord was burning in the white flames like that,
 </p>
 <p>
  […I shall shed a skin.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A voice that sounded like it was holding back anger flowed out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hiss…
 </p>
 <p>
  The burning serpent head and a part of the body shed a layer.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s sacred flame was separated along with it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What the heck is that? Why is the sacred flame being transferred too?’
 </p>
 <p>
  No, the Dragon Thunder went into its mouth, but it took it out with shedding?
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Lord.
 </p>
 <p>
  As expected of a Great Constellation, he didn’t just die.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The constellation ‘Three-Winged Black Dragon’ has fallen in battle.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have subdued a highest-grade constellation.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your level increases by 5.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A level up message appeared in front of Seong Jihan’s eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Usually, even if you subdued a powerful being in-game, the level wouldn’t increase much.
 </p>
 <p>
  Maybe because the opponent was a level 9 constellation, it soared by a whopping 5.
 </p>
 <p>
  And.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  As the Dragon Lord’s shed skin fell to the ground,
 </p>
 <p>
  It soon transformed from the shape of a serpent into the form of a black dragon with three wings.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This dragon self-destructed in the round of 256.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Black Dragon that had definitely self-destructed and gave him an extra head.
 </p>
 <p>
  Did he die in place of the Dragon Lord’s shedding?
 </p>
 <p>
  After looking at the Black Dragon’s corpse, Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The sacred flame still remains.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Approached the sacred flame that was still maintaining its flames there.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’m sure I can absorb abilities with the sacred flame.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan reached out his hand towards the white flames,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your Stat Red increases by 2.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your Stat Martial Soul increases by 1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Not only Red, but Martial Soul also grew.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Compared to directly devouring the Lord’s dragon flames, the growth rate is lower, but…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, it’s better than nothing.
 </p>
 <p>
  After meticulously gathering stats like that, Seong Jihan looked upwards.
 </p>
 <p>
  The serpent head that had shed its skin looked as healthy as before.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey. You said you would help me level up last time, is this what you meant?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [What? Don’t tell me… you leveled up?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, it went up by a whopping 5. So, want to shed some more skins?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh. Whoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan spun his spear around and grinned,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Lord looked down at Seong Jihan and slowly opened his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  [That won’t happen.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You and I have a bad compatibility, you know?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That… I admit. In terms of the authority of fire, I am clearly inferior. However.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  The serpent’s eyes sparkled.
 </p>
 <p>
  [A constellation candidate cannot defy the Dragon Lord’s Dragon Speech.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Dragon Speech?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I command the player Seong Jihan.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Then.
 </p>
 <p>
  Another layer of the Dragon Lord’s skin shed once more.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Cut off your right arm and bring it to me.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  At those words, Seong Jihan’s body, which had been relaxed, flinched and stiffened.
 </p>
 <p>
  The dragon’s authority to infuse power into language.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although he had easily overcome the Dragon Speech of the Red Dragon Altkaizen,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Lord’s was clearly on a different level.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, holding the sword with his left hand and placing it on his arm, hesitated.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  As he stopped moving like that and endured,
 </p>
 <p>
  Hiss…𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Lord’s head slowly descended to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I command you once more. Cut off your right arm and bring it to me.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Dragon Speech was repeated once more, another skin was shed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The two skins that fell to the ground had already transformed into the corpses of giant dragons.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Lord’s Dragon Speech, which used up the bodies of level 9 dragon clan constellations to the point of giving it strength,
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally made Seong Jihan take action.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Slice!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who had cut off his own right arm,
 </p>
 <p>
  Dropped the dark sword to the ground and lifted this right hand instead.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, he began to walk step by step towards the serpent’s head that had descended to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  [To try to defy even the Lord’s words… If you had grown more, it would have been big trouble.]
 </p>
 <p>
  While saying that, the Dragon Lord began to approach Seong Jihan first.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since it was unknown when the Dragon Speech would be released, he had to quickly receive and retrieve the right hand Seong Jihan was offering.
 </p>
 <p>
  So he approached Seong Jihan and opened his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Throw your arm.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who raised his right arm high according to the Lord’s command.
 </p>
 <p>
  His eyes were still hazy until then.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You want my arm, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As he got closer to the Lord, his eyes quickly found light.
 </p>
 <p>
  […You?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “But I can’t bear to give you my right arm or left arm.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Plop.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan inserted the right arm he had cut into the severed end.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then the arm that quickly reattached and regenerated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s right hand holding the spear moved cleanly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Instead, I’ll stab the spear I cherish like my own arm into you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bzzt!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Phoenix Spear imbued with lightning directly pierced through the wide-open mouth of the serpent head.

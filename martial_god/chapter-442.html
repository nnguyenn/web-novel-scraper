  Chapter 442
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  White flame erupted from the Dragon Lord’s head pierced by the spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  His elongated vertical pupils wriggled wildly.
 </p>
 <p>
  [How did you… overcome my Dragon Speech?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even if it’s Dragon Speech, it’s inferior to the Domination Code.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recalled when the Dragon Lord used Dragon Speech a little while ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Speech of the Lord, which had paid the price of shedding one skin.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the corpse of the Level 9 Dragon Constellation fell to the ground,
 </p>
 <p>
  Letters similar to the Domination Code were transparently engraved in the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘At a glance, that was clearly an inferior version of the Domination Code.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He was said to be the Red Administrator’s pet, so did he imitate his master’s code?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who discovered the Domination Code, could have immediately canceled the Dragon Speech.
 </p>
 <p>
  But he decided to take advantage of it and pretended to be under its influence.
 </p>
 <p>
  After all, his right arm had reached the level where he could reattach it even if it was cut off.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, when Seong Jihan brought up the Domination Code,
 </p>
 <p>
  […Domination Code? Don’t tell me you can perfectly operate that too?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Lord opened his eyes wide in disbelief.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not to the point of perfection. But I can easily overcome your Dragon Speech. You should have imitated your master’s better.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […You bastard.]
 </p>
 <p>
  When his master was mentioned, the Dragon Lord’s face contorted.
 </p>
 <p>
  But Seong Jihan didn’t care.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stat Red increases by 5.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stat Martial Soul increases by 3.]
 </p>
 <p>
  He was burning the Dragon Lord’s head with sacred flame and absorbing stats.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I wish it would burn a little longer.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He thought only Red would increase, but it also raised Martial Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  Is it because mana previously belonged to the category of Martial Soul?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan smiled at the message showing his stats growing rapidly due to the sacred flame.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dragon Lord.
 </p>
 <p>
  He thought he would possess overwhelming strength befitting a Great Constellation.
 </p>
 <p>
  But after actually fighting him, he was an opponent that could be handled entirely with the Red authority.
 </p>
 <p>
  All the abilities he possessed were inferior versions of Stat Red.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan continued to stab with his spear and raise the sacred flame,
 </p>
 <p>
  […I will shed two skins.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Lord attempted to shed his skin.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack…!
 </p>
 <p>
  A layer of dark red serpent’s skin was shed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Immediately, another one was shed from inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  The skins that fell to the sides quickly turned into two dragon corpses.
 </p>
 <p>
  The flame that had been attached to the Dragon Lord’s body immediately moved to them.
 </p>
 <p>
  The impact that the Lord’s head had received was all transferred to the shed skins.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Phoenix Spear that Seong Jihan had stabbed also smoothly came out during the process of the Dragon Lord shedding his skin.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This wasn’t in the Red authority. The Dragon Lord seems to have the best skin shedding ability.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If Martial God’s head was also like that, could he also shed his skin?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought so and stabbed the pushed spear back in.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kang!
 </p>
 <p>
  [There won’t be a second time.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike before, the mouth of the serpent’s head that closed was quite solid.
 </p>
 <p>
  After bouncing off the spear, the Dragon Lord quickly flew into the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  His movement was the most nimble among what had been seen so far.
 </p>
 <p>
  -When Seong Jihan was being Dominationled, I thought it was over…
 </p>
 <p>
  -He pretended to be under the influence of Dragon Speech lol. He made him shed two skins.
 </p>
 <p>
  -When the Dragon Lord descended, he came down leisurely, but when he’s running away, he’s fast as hell lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -If he stays still, he’ll shed his skin again, so of course he has to run away with all his might.
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers mocked the fleeing Dragon Lord.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But does he have unlimited skins? How many times will he keep shedding? ㅡㅡ
 </p>
 <p>
  -He has shed a total of 5 so far. Originally, he should have 10 heads, so there should be 5 skins left, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Then there are 5 dragons left.
 </p>
 <p>
  -He might have eaten not only Level 9 constellations but also Level 8 ones, so there might be fewer dragons.
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  -Anyway, half of his power has been stripped away lol
 </p>
 <p>
  People tried to estimate how long the Dragon Lord would last based on the skins he had shed so far.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile,
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have subdued two of the highest-level constellations.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your level increases by 10.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Due to the Dragon Lord’s skin shedding, Seong Jihan’s level rose significantly again.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stat Red increases by 4.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stat Martial Soul increases by 2.]
 </p>
 <p>
  He didn’t forget to collect stats from the burning dragon corpses.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The skin used earlier with Dragon Speech doesn’t count as one I killed.’
 </p>
 <p>
  What a pity.
 </p>
 <p>
  If that was included, the level would have risen by 25.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Still, he’s the one who has made me grow the most recently. This guy.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the Dragon Lord floating in the sky with satisfied eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  A snake that looked creepy at first, but looked prettier the more levels rose.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, I understand now. Why the Red chose you as a pet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […What nonsense are you talking about?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now that my level has risen by 15, even a snake looks a bit cute. If you raise my level a little more, I might also take a snake as a pet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You bastard…! If it was my main body, I would have torn you to death right away!]
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan emphasized him being a pet, the Dragon Lord shook his head furiously.
 </p>
 <p>
  But,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, sure. If it was your main body, maybe Dragon Speech might have worked. But… you’re not the main body, are you?”DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh. Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  He twirled the spear and showed composure.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your attacks, not a single one is working.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […I admit that my power has not yet reached the Administrator’s authority with an avatar. But do you think that’s all the power I have?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Zing…!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Dragon Lord released mana,
 </p>
 <p>
  A huge magic circle began to overlap and be drawn in the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Lord, who tried to suppress Seong Jihan with grand magic as the Dragon Flame and Dragon Speech didn’t work.
 </p>
 <p>
  But,
 </p>
 <p>
  “If that was so powerful, you would have used it from the beginning.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In Seong Jihan’s eyes, the magic circle filling the sky only looked like the Dragon Lord’s struggle.
 </p>
 <p>
  After all, compared to the Dragon Flame and Dragon Speech, the efficiency of power in grand magic was relatively poor.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I didn’t use it because I had to leave the hand intact. Now I will grind you to dust and take the Red Administrator’s remains from there.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so? But what you said earlier. The same goes for me.”
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  […]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I haven’t used all my power.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Hiss…
 </p>
 <p>
  With those words, the energy of the void rose from Seong Jihan’s face.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The void… Didn’t you use it earlier?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, until now you were too easy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan lightly replied to the Dragon Lord who was shocked to see this.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now, it’s a bit worth fighting.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Holding a sword and spear, he charged into the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  The final match of the arena.
 </p>
 <p>
  The battle between the Dragon Lord, who descended through the Level 9 constellations, and Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  The end was slowly coming into view.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Dragon Lord is no longer shedding his skin. He’s trying to endure somehow.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Rather than enduring, it seems he gave up.]
 </p>
 <p>
  From the commentator’s seat, Seong Jiah pointed at the screen with her petrified finger.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Lord, who had been fighting with Seong Jihan in the sky and was eventually pierced by his spear again,
 </p>
 <p>
  Was being engulfed by white flame without using the skin shedding he had used several times before.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Earlier, when he was stabbed by the spear, he tried to somehow suppress it with mana. But now he’s just leaving it alone.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so? Then is it the end… What a pity.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [What a pity? For what?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you’re going to fight, fill up the 8 hours. It ended in 7 hours and 21 minutes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Shadow Queen’s voice was filled with regret.
 </p>
 <p>
  -The Queen is really greedy, seriously lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -Fighting for 7 hours should be enough lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -But the Dragon Lord really isn’t shedding his skin anymore.
 </p>

 <p>
  -Seong Jiah sees well, better than the Queen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed, Seong Jiah, who possessed the Divine Eye, had a higher hit rate that was easier for ordinary viewers to understand compared to the Shadow Queen.
 </p>
 <p>
  As people were anticipating whether Seong Jiah’s prediction would be correct this time while looking at the game screen,
 </p>
 <p>
  […I admit it. With an avatar, I cannot subdue you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Lord, who was burning in white flame, spoke in a rather calm voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  [But the main body will be different. When that time comes, I will surely wash away this humiliation…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  With those last words, the serpent’s head was completely engulfed in flame and disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then the last Level 9 constellation, the Seven-Horned Blue Dragon, fell to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why does this guy only admit things? lol He’s been admitting and admitting since earlier…
 </p>
 <p>
  -He’s not really admitting it, did you see him talking about his main body at the end? lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -Seriously pathetic.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Guys like that will get 100% beaten even if they come with their main body lol
 </p>
 <p>
  The human viewers laughed at the Dragon Lord and rejoiced at Seong Jihan’s victory.
 </p>
 <p>
  But,
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow… Does this make sense?
 </p>
 <p>
  -The Dragon Lord lost? Even after fusing Level 9 constellations like that?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Even if it’s the worst matchup due to the Red authority… Still, that Dragon Lord lost?
 </p>
 <p>
  -They’re Level 9 constellations. Level 9!!
 </p>
 <p>
  -That guy isn’t even a constellation!
 </p>
 <p>
  The alien viewers were shocked to see the result of the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the Dragon Lord’s authority was not favorable to Seong Jihan due to the matchup,
 </p>
 <p>
  They never imagined that a Great Constellation would be pushed back like this without ever gaining the upper hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is Seong Jihan still a constellation candidate? Even still?
 </p>
 <p>
  -There was a player like this so far?
 </p>
 <p>
  -What? Really? Is it a racial buff? I heard humans also won the beginner’s arena this time?
 </p>
 <p>
  -I was curious so I tried to change my race with a conversion kit but I couldn’t select Human. Seems like a cheat race.
 </p>
 <p>
  -No… If it’s a cheat race, it can’t remain at a low rank;
 </p>
 <p>
  To the point where theories of humanity being a cheat race emerged, the alien races were shocked by this result.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Dragon Lord. I love you.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who finished the final match, smiled broadly as he saw the levels and stats that rose significantly from a single battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Lord, who shed his skin several times and raised his level by a total of 40,
 </p>
 <p>
  Had also upgraded his Red and Martial Soul stats nicely.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I didn’t even turn on constellation traits, but it was so easy to deal with him. He’s really a nice Great Constellation…’
 </p>
 <p>
  With this mood, he could raise a hundred snakes in his penthouse.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recalled the serpent’s head that had given generously once more, and saw a new message pop up.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Special reward, ‘Racial Evolution Bonus’ is given.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Strength increases by +4.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Agility increases by +4.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Mana increases by +3.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The owner of the arena kept his promise, and this time it was a racial evolution bonus without fire affinity.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  Wriggle. Wriggle.
 </p>
 <p>
  After receiving the evolution bonus, red eyes were moving little by little on the back of Seong Jihan’s hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I gained too much Stat Red this time, and mana also stimulated the Red’s hand, so that is why… The seal will probably be released soon.’
 </p>
 <p>
  When this guy wakes up, he’ll likely cause a fuss saying to burn humanity right away.
 </p>
 <p>
  Growing so much this time also has its downsides.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought so and looked around his room.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Come to think of it, that Gilgamesh… Wasn’t he caught?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Martial God’s head that was said to be the same as the Dragon Lord’s.
 </p>
 <p>
  Only after finishing the battle did Seong Jihan become curious about the whereabouts of the information provider.
 </p>
 <p>
  Did he perhaps send a message?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan opened the cell phone placed on one side of his room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  […Seong Jihan. Because you moved your mouth recklessly, my youth has disappeared.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [I gave you the information for nothing. Trusting you…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [No, you won?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You won against the Dragon Lord…]
 </p>
 <p>
  […]
 </p>
 <p>
  Looks like Martial God found out.
 </p>
 <p>
  But why are there so many dots in the message?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was frowning while looking at Gilgamesh’s nutrient-deficient messages.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ding.
 </p>
 <p>
  A message arrived in real time.
 </p>
 <p>
  […Fine. Try calling me father. Then I shall forgive you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Has he gone mad?”
 </p>

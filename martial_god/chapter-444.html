  Chapter 444
 </p>
 <p>
  The previous tournament where the Dragon Lord’s avatar was defeated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Seong Jihan didn’t feel it much as he was busy talking with Gilgamesh afterwards,
 </p>
 <p>
  -Even after trampling the Dragon Lord’s avatar like that…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Who would dare to challenge him?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Seems like even Level 9s won’t apply to participate;
 </p>
 <p>
  Currently, this was the biggest topic drawing attention on BattleTube.
 </p>
 <p>
  -The Dragon Lord’s avatar was on a different level from Level 9 constellations.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yeah, all the other participants were trampled by the dragon constellations.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But Seong Jihan easily suppressed that…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Honestly, tell me. You’re an administrator, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Aren’t you really the Red Administrator?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Because he freely uses the Red authority too.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Lord’s avatar, which had grown by devouring Level 9 constellations, was overwhelmingly strong to anyone’s eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was to the point where there were talks of Space Arena colluding with the dragon race.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the appearance Seong Jihan showed in the finals completely overwhelmed the Lord’s avatar.
 </p>
 <p>
  Furthermore, even though the Red’s hand was sealed, he freely used the Red authority and showed who the owner of the flames was.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Then wouldn’t it be difficult even if the Dragon Lord fights in his Great Constellation state?
 </p>
 <p>
  -That’s possible. Since both fire and Dragon Speech were blocked.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But he put up a good fight when using grand magic…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Still, Seong Jihan won in the end.
 </p>
 <p>
  -You know what’s amazing? Seong Jihan is still not a constellation… He still has room to grow;
 </p>
 <p>
  When BattleTube was first revealed to aliens, many viewers used to bet money on Seong Jihan’s defeat.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Seong Jihan’s recent track record was so unrivaled that the evaluation of him had completely reversed, despite being tied to the human race.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘From this atmosphere, it seems Level 9 constellations won’t participate.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Now that even the Dragon Lord was defeated, would the Level 9 constellations who were inferior to the dragon race even participate in the battle?
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, Dongbang Sak might participate regardless of this.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But then there’s no point in holding this tournament.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The reason for holding the tournament with the Red’s hand as the prize was ultimately to subdue a Great Constellation and become an administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a side effect, he did receive the human race’s bonus, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If the participation rate of Level 9 constellations is low, that bonus will also be reduced…’
 </p>
 <p>
  If he was really unlucky, it might create a 1:1 structure with only Dongbang Sak instead of a tournament.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no need to deliberately create such a situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems the atmosphere is that even Level 9 constellations won’t participate in the tournament. Then, we’ll have no choice but to hold the tournament after confirming Challenger 5. The Great Constellations will participate, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The current level was 635.
 </p>
 <p>
  To reach Challenger 5, he only needed to raise 5 levels to reach 640, so in fact, there was no need to deliberately postpone the schedule.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, to definitely confront a Great Constellation, Seong Jihan announced that he would proceed with the tournament after becoming Challenger 5.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Indeed, if the tournament is held at Challenger 6, there might be no guests;
 </p>
 <p>
  -So who told you to mercilessly defeat the Dragon Lord like that?
 </p>
 <p>
  -But what if Great Constellations don’t participate even after becoming Challenger 5?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Huh, ignoring Great Constellations? No way they won’t come when they can participate with their main body.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how easily Seong Jihan defeated the Dragon Lord’s avatar,
 </p>
 <p>
  If Great Constellations could participate with their main body, of course they would join the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not only Seong Jihan but most viewers thought so.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Dragon Lord sponsored 100 million GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [I will not participate in Space Arena. The arena map was manipulated.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A message opposite to their thoughts popped up on the sponsorship window.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Map manipulation?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the sponsorship message with dumbfounded eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  At first, he thought he saw it wrong, but even after blinking his eyes, the message that came this time was definitely from the Great Constellation Dragon Lord.
 </p>
 <p>
  -What… The Dragon Lord is boycotting the tournament? Wow
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  -Is he saying he lost last time not because of skill but because of the arena?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow, complaining about the map…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is it not an impersonation? Did the Dragon Lord really send this?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Who would impersonate while shooting 100 million GP?
 </p>
 <p>
  A Great Constellation blaming the arena and boycotting the next tournament.
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers were bewildered by the message they never even imagined.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan asked, thinking it couldn’t be.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Could it be that our Dragon Lord was frightened by the last defeat? Because a Great Constellation was miserably defeated by a constellation candidate?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Dragon Lord sponsored 100 million GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The fact that my authority didn’t work is, no matter how much I think about it, because the void operated the arena’s map. You, the host of the tournament, and the owner of the arena must have manipulated the final match map.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Sending messages while steadily sponsoring 100 million GP each time was nothing but pathetic.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan raised the corners of his mouth and retorted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You were the one who manipulated it in the first place. Does it make sense to bring in 128 dragons in the round of 256? What kind of collusion did you have with the owner of the arena?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Dragon Lord sponsored 100 million GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [That is the participation right I legitimately purchased by paying the void a proper price. It’s different from a player like you who manipulated the map.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Bringing in 128 dragon constellations is legitimate, but losing in the finals is manipulation?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow, this is a bit…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Was the Dragon Lord this pathetic; He had the image of a great ruler who revived the dragon race…
 </p>
 <p>
  -But what if it’s really map manipulation? Honestly, it doesn’t make sense for a constellation candidate to defeat a Great Constellation’s avatar.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why would the arena owner manipulate?
 </p>
 <p>
  -To believe in the fairness of the arena, they already allowed 128 dragon constellations to participate.
 </p>
 <p>
  Many viewers criticized the Dragon Lord after seeing his message.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, some opinions that it might really be manipulation were not uncommon.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s how unbelievable the result of the last battle was.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This guy won’t come.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan cleanly gave up on the Dragon Lord who was acting pathetically.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s not like the Dragon Lord is the only Great Constellation, and there will be more who will participate.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. Don’t participate. You’ll lose even if you do anyway, so at least protect your pride.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan gestured as if telling him to go away.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Dragon Lord sponsored 100 million GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [I warn the Great Constellations who are showing interest in this tournament. Do you really think this result makes sense? My avatar originally had the performance to draw out 50% of the main body’s power.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Lord went beyond boycotting participation and threatened other Great Constellations not to participate.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…That was 50%? You’re weak.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Dragon Lord sponsored 100 million GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [I’m weak? It’s absurd to say that after winning on a manipulated map. If you’re really that strong, specially dedicate yourself to me. Then I’ll fight with my main body.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Lord was telling Seong Jihan to use ‘special dedication’, which was originally a method of cutting off one’s hand and sending it, on himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Then in the end, Seong Jihan is going to the Dragon Lord’s lair?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is a Great Constellation calling a constellation candidate to his home ground?;
 </p>
 <p>
  -Still, it’s hard to believe that the Dragon Lord’s power was 50% in the last match. He lost so easily even with that power…
 </p>
 <p>
  -I think the map manipulation is true.
 </p>
 <p>
  -What manipulation… No matter how you look at it, it seems some dragons have entered the chat room lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yeah, it seems they’re trying to spread manipulation theories.
 </p>
 <p>
  And since the Dragon Lord mentioned the 50% power of his main body, the chat room was in chaos.
 </p>
 <p>
  The chat arguing whether it was map manipulation or not was endless.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Dragon Lord… Seeing him act like that, he must have judged that it would be difficult to defeat me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Lord, whose compatibility with the Red authority was extremely bad.
 </p>
 <p>
  When fighting him, Seong Jihan had not even used all the buffs he could mobilize.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nevertheless, he suppressed an avatar with 50% of its power.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if he faced the real Dragon Lord, if he turned on constellation traits and properly utilized the void, it would be a fight worth having.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed the Dragon Lord also did some calculations and was acting like this because the odds were not in his favor.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Should I have won with a bit more difficulty last time?’
 </p>
 <p>
  But he was too weak for that.
 </p>

 <p>
  As Stat Red became stronger, these problems arose.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to give up on the Dragon Lord for now.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he really wanted to catch him, he could go there and fight through special dedication.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But even if I go and win, the return method is the problem.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He didn’t even know where the Dragon Lord’s lair was in the universe.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no need to go that far.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anyway, he only needed to catch one Great Constellation.
 </p>
 <p>
  One Great Constellation would show up in the tournament.
 </p>
 <p>
  “As you can see, the Dragon Lord admitted defeat without even fighting. It seems he was very frightened after being pushed back too much in the last battle. Then, let’s proceed with the tournament with others.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan said that and was about to turn off BattleTube.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, just before he left,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Dragon Lord sponsored 100 million GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’re avoiding the special dedication. It seems you don’t have the courage to fight me in a place that’s not a manipulated map. Then… I’ll give you some courage.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Lord shot a meaningful message until the end while shooting 100 million GP.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…What is he trying to do?’Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned looking at the message.
 </p>
 <p>
  Somehow, it seemed like it would become quite troublesome.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  4 days later.
 </p>
 <p>
  =Everyone! Thank you for waiting. The Space League match… is now starting!
 </p>
 <p>
  =The opposing race is the ‘Red-Haired Dragon Clan’. We’ve met them once before!
 </p>
 <p>
  A regular match of the human Space League was held.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re meeting the dragon clan again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There are still races we haven’t met, but we’re fighting the previous opponent again… I don’t know how the schedule was arranged.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the same with the World Tree Elves.
 </p>
 <p>
  Why are we meeting the dragon clan again so quickly?
 </p>
 <p>
  When the players were puzzled about why the match schedule was arranged like this,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle. Don’t you think the dragons will do something today?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah spoke with a serious face, looking at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why all of a sudden?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you mean why, the dragons have been causing a mess on your channel these days. The elves became quiet, so now the dragons are really…”
 </p>
 <p>
  After the Dragon Lord spread the map manipulation theory,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whenever Seong Jihan matched a game and turned on BattleTube, the dragons would rush in and flood the sponsorship message window.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Seong Jihan, clarify your collusion with the arena.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Apologize and compensate the victims who suffered damage due to the manipulated map!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The tournament was manipulated!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The dragons who flooded such messages and spread manipulation theories.
 </p>
 <p>
  The dragons’ attempt to cover up the Dragon Lord’s defeat with manipulation theories was somewhat successful.
 </p>
 <p>
  On BattleTube, quite a few videos dealing with the Seong Jihan-Arena collusion theory had been uploaded in a few days.
 </p>
 <p>
  From the perspective of the victim, it would be quite annoying.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thanks to that, I multiplied my wealth a lot.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The person in question was nonchalant.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The dragons have a lot of money.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… To send sponsorship to Uncle now, you have to pay 100 million GP, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. If they’re going to spread manipulation theories while paying that much, I’ll take it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When the dragon clan flooded the sponsorship message window, Seong Jihan set the price high so that they had to pay at least 100 million GP to send sponsorship.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was virtually a price telling them not to send sponsorship messages.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nevertheless, the messages from the dragon clan only slightly decreased, and the flooding did not stop.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s GP, which was already high, had been further upgraded.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to find a way to use this overflowing GP somehow…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Was there a way to raise stats with this GP?
 </p>
 <p>
  Around the time when Seong Jihan was immersed in such happy concerns while looking at his ever-increasing wealth,
 </p>
 <p>
  =Both team coaches, please enter the coach’s room.
 </p>
 <p>
  =The ban and select for the 1st match. It’s about to begin!
 </p>
 <p>
  The human coach, Davis, and
 </p>
 <p>
  The ‘Red-Haired Dragon Clan’ coach, Altkaizen, entered the coach’s room.

  Chapter 446
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. I don’t know how they found out, but they contacted me and asked about Earth’s coordinates.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  That bastard Dragon Lord, he was resorting to mobilizing his race for petty tricks since it seemed he really couldn’t win.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t tell me, Queen… You didn’t tell them because you were struggling with debt, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you take me for to say such a thing! And the battle with the Dragon Lord has been quite a long one, so the deficit has decreased a lot.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s fortunate.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But I still need to receive investment…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Didn’t American First say they would invest?”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Yoon Seah’s question, the Shadow Queen shook her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re still negotiating. American First said they want me to come to the US altogether.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What, they want you to come to the US?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. On the surface, they say it’s for smooth broadcasting consultation, but it seemed like they had other motives.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They probably want to bring a constellation into their country.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the Shadow Queen’s image changed to a somewhat familiar one to people as she announced she would be commentating for this tournament,
 </p>
 <p>
  She was a high-level constellation, just not fully recovered in strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  While investing in the channel management rights, it seemed American First’s aim was to bring the constellation into their country as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘We can’t leave it like that.’
 </p>
 <p>
  “Queen, how much do you need?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, don’t tell me you’re thinking of investing?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, the Daegi Guild has money piled up anyway.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the Queen doesn’t seem to want to go either, it’s better to make it clear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to invest the GP accumulated in the Daegi Guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then I’m grateful. Actually, there are times when I act as your sword, so going to the US is difficult.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sword role… But now, even without you in Eclipse, there’s enough firepower.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Well, your Shadow Sword has become too closely tied to the void and has left my domain. From the beginning, it has diverged a lot from the planned Shadow Authority.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so? Then there’s no need for you to enter the sword?”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s question, the Shadow Queen nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right. However, depending on whether I’m there or not, there can be a 10-20% difference in power.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll have to calculate it accurately later.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If there was no big difference, there was no need to bind the Constellation Shadow Queen to the sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought he should test it out after finishing the investment matter and,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hayeon, there’s a lot of funds left in the guild, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  He called Hayeon right there on the spot.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ah… Yes. GP keeps accumulating!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems American First is trying to take the Shadow Queen to the US this time. So we’re thinking of just investing in the Queen ourselves.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ah, but investing in the Queen will lead to ruin… Wasn’t it?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can hear everything.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Oh, you were next to him… But the performance is really bad!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s okay. I’ll put in half of my personal GP too. Those dragon bastards have been sponsoring me so much lately that I have money overflowing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ah, no, Boss. Let’s handle it with the Daegi Guild’s GP for now, and if it’s still lacking, I’ll ask for help. We had nowhere to use it anyway.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright. Then I’ll leave it to you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Seong Jihan said he would put in his personal assets if GP was lacking, Hayeon strongly declined.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… Listening to the conversation, it sounds like you’re in the mood to waste money. Why don’t you think I’ll multiply the investment amount?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Will you? I’ll save you from being dragged by the World Tree Elves, so don’t ever buy broadcasting rights and such again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your answer?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, okay.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s question, the Shadow Queen nodded reluctantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This matter is resolved for now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Queen’s issue was handled by the Daegi Guild investing, but the real problem was the dragons.
 </p>
 <p>
  The dragon race, whose numbers had increased exponentially with some help from the World Tree Alliance,
 </p>
 <p>
  They were desperate to find out Earth’s location.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Honestly, among people, if they say they’ll give 100 billion… There would be quite a few who would leak the coordinates, right?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Right now, people don’t know how to view the planet coordinates on BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  But as time passes and the planet coordinates become known, some people in urgent need of money will definitely sell the coordinates to them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before such a thing happens, the dragon issue needs to be dealt with to some extent.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If only the special dedication was certain, I could just invade the Lord bastard’s lair.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite being mortal enemies, the Dragon Lord was still Seong Jihan’s sponsoring constellation.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he offered himself to the Dragon Lord, he could go to the Dragon Lord’s lair, but
 </p>
 <p>
  This method couldn’t be used now because there was no way to return to Earth.
 </p>

 <p>
  ‘For now, I need to level up a bit and come back…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought about how to deal with the dragons and decided to prioritize leveling up first.
 </p>
 <p>
  The level that reached 635 was now rising too slowly, so he had to consistently run matches every day.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m going to level up a bit and come back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, you’re going to run matches? Okay, have a safe trip~”
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, Seong Jihan, who started the game,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Cosmic Tree Yggdrasil says it heard an interesting offer from the Dragon Lord.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Why are you appearing again?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Received a message from Yggdrasil as soon as he connected to BattleTube.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  The message from Yggdrasil that popped up as soon as the game started.
 </p>
 <p>
  -These days, the dragon race keeps sending sponsorship messages, and now even Yggdrasil is appearing
 </p>
 <p>
  -What a mess, really…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Elves and dragons are bullshitting together, lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -But why does Yggdrasil’s text color look different and appear separately like a sponsorship window even though it didn’t sponsor?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Probably because it’s an administrator;
 </p>
 <p>
  Human viewers were shocked by the combination of elves and dragons.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the alien races, the two races that overwhelmingly compete for the top 1 and 2 spots in unpopularity among humans.
 </p>
 <p>
  They couldn’t help but worry about what kind of shenanigans those two were trying to pull together.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s the interesting offer?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Dragon Lord offered to provide 22 dragon race planets and 10,000 hatchlings in exchange for revealing the planet’s location, Yggdrasil says.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you know where Earth is?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yggdrasil says he has figured out the location to some extent with administrator privileges.]
 </p>
 <p>
  At those words, Seong Jihan recalled the time when the Ancient Elf tried to invade before.
 </p>
 <p>
  Come to think of it, the Ancient Elf had figured out the coordinates well and tried to invade.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Was that possible because it had an administrator as a backer.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Great Constellation and administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s definitely a difference in authority.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking so, Seong Jihan looked at the chat window with sunken eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So what are you thinking of doing?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Cosmic Tree Yggdrasil says he’s on Seong Jihan’s side, but the other side has made an offer that is hard to refuse.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you mean my side? Just get to the point.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yggdrasil says if Seong Jihan becomes a member of the World Tree Elves for 22 years, he will immediately refuse the dragon race’s offer.]
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ah, these irritating things ㅡㅡ
 </p>
 <p>
  -But why 22 years?
 </p>
 <p>
  -The dragon race offered 22 planets, so it probably judged the value based on that.
 </p>
 <p>
  -1 year of Seong Jihan per planet? Did it value him highly?
 </p>
 <p>
  -If he refuses this offer, will Earth’s coordinates just be revealed…
 </p>
 <p>
  The Cosmic Tree Yggdrasil, trying to draw Seong Jihan into the World Tree Alliance, counting 1 year per planet.
 </p>
 <p>
  Following the Dragon Lord’s coercion, when the threat from the Cosmic Tree continued, Seong Jihan hardened his expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If I refuse?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yggdrasil answers that then, although he doesn’t want to, it will have no choice but to accept the dragon race’s trade offer.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I see…”
 </p>
 <p>
  They’re excited to have something to threaten with.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There’s no need to join the World Tree Alliance to avoid the dragons.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If the dragons invade, there’s at least a fight to be had, but if he enters there, it’s just the end.
 </p>
 <p>
  The green administrator will sincerely, thoroughly manage Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile,
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s an enemy here!”
 </p>
 <p>
  In the matched game, a player on Seong Jihan’s opposing team tried to find him and attack, but
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, I’m a bit busy right now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan swung his sword once as if annoyed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fundamental Divine Art,
 </p>
 <p>
  Triad of Martial Mastery
 </p>
 <p>
  Total Annihilation Horizontal Sweep.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kyaaak!
 </p>
 <p>
  Then the players of various races were swept away at once.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Even at Challenger 6, he just sweeps them away like swatting flies
 </p>
 <p>
  -He trampled the Dragon Lord and came, so these guys are nothing…
 </p>
 <p>
  -He trampled too hard lol The Dragon Lord got scared and is only doing petty tricks behind the scenes.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Tbh In hindsight, he should have let himself get hit a bit.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But what can we do if the Lord is weak lol.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  People now accept such results as natural.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan became the top scorer on the current team with a single Total Annihilation Horizontal Sweep and put his sword back in.
 </p>
 <p>
  And,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I earned the score, so now I need to do some threatening too.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Can’t just keep getting hit and live with it.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan saw the name of the Cosmic Tree Yggdrasil, he decided to bring out the means of threat that came to mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Inventory.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Opening the inventory and taking out an item,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yggdrasil. Do you recognize what this is?”
 </p>
 <p>
  He waved it towards the screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  -What’s that…
 </p>
 <p>
  -I thought he took out some great item, but it’s just a red button.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is he bluffing?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Tsk. Does he think that will work against Yggdrasil…
 </p>
 <p>
  The item Seong Jihan took out was a single button.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the red button protruding on the metal plate mixed with purple and red is impressive,
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s just that.
 </p>
 <p>
  Alien viewers initially scoffed at what he could do with such an item, but
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Cosmic Tree Yggdrasil wonders why such an item received an EX grade.]
 </p>
 <p>
  -EX?
 </p>
 <p>
  -That button?
 </p>
 <p>
  -What is it used for to be given such a grade…
 </p>
 <p>
  When Yggdrasil figured out the item grade, they showed a surprised reaction.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You can figure out the grade, but it seems you can’t see the item information?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Cosmic Tree Yggdrasil says there are limits to what he can observe through BattleTube and asks what the item is used for.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a bit much to reveal it to all these viewers… Alright. Can I show the item information only to you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, before long, a message window popped up in front of Seong Jihan’s eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do you want to reveal the item information to the Cosmic Tree Yggdrasil?]
 </p>
 <p>
  BattleTube had this function too?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s convenient at times like this when the other party is an administrator.’
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan pressed yes, the information of the item he was holding was fully conveyed to Yggdrasil.
 </p>
 <p>
  [World Tree Ignition Device]
 </p>
 <p>
  -Item Grade: EX
 </p>
 <p>
  -When the button is pressed, sacred flame blooms from Earth’s World Tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  -It is only activated when in possession of the Red’s hand, and all power absorbed from the sacred flame belongs to the owner of the hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  -This effect is not constrained by distance.
 </p>
 <p>
  -This item is a one-time use item.
 </p>
 <p>
  The item given by the owner of the arena, the World Tree Ignition Device.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just press one button and the sacred flame will ignite the World Tree, burning all of humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  And Seong Jihan can absorb the power of that sacred flame to become the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is basically spoon-feeding him to become an administrator at all costs.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Cosmic Tree Yggdrasil is shocked, asking what kind of item this is.]
 </p>
 <p>
  It was no wonder Yggdrasil was startled.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Yggdrasil was wary of the Red Administrator rising before it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Cosmic Tree Yggdrasil, who does all sorts of things with the World Tree Elves to become a permanent administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the meantime, it was wary of the Red Administrator becoming a permanent administrator before it.
 </p>
 <p>
  So it was also Yggdrasil who informed Seong Jihan of a way to become a temporary administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So this World Tree Ignition Device is the most shocking item to Yggdrasil.’
 </p>
 <p>
  While someone is working their bones off to become a permanent administrator,
 </p>
 <p>
  In fact, Seong Jihan can become a Red Administrator just by pressing a button, and even an administrator who can surpass the permanent one.
 </p>
 <p>
  From Yggdrasil’s perspective, it was like having fire dropped on its feet.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I originally thought about not pressing this and doing as you say…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan lifted the World Tree Ignition Device and gently stroked the button side.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But these days, there are so many annoying guys. Especially when our Cosmic Tree threatened me. I felt like pressing it and abandoning everything.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Cosmic Tree Yggdrasil urges you to stay calm.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [He says what he said earlier was just a joke, how could it sell the coordinates of the human race’s planet to the dragon race, and asks if you don’t trust him.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I should trust you? Me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan laughed and tapped next to the button, then
 </p>
 <p>
  Swiped the button with his finger.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where is there trust between us? Ah. Right… If you handle the dragon issue, maybe trust will form.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Cosmic Tree Yggdrasil asks if you really won’t press the button then.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. If they don’t act up, there’s no need to press the button.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan grinned.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So you handle them for me instead.”

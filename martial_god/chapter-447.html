  Chapter 447
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan took out the World Tree ignition device.
 </p>
 <p>
  The effect of threatening this was tremendous.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Cosmic Tree Yggdrasil says he scolded the Dragon Lord well.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [He adds that the dragon race will never cause trouble again.]
 </p>
 <p>
  About 5 minutes after Seong Jihan told Yggdrasil to handle it,
 </p>
 <p>
  Yggdrasil told Seong Jihan in the chat window that the job was done.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow, amazing…
 </p>
 <p>
  -The dragons quieted down right away;
 </p>
 <p>
  -So the World Tree Elves really are above the dragons.
 </p>
 <p>
  -More than elves, it’s the administrator’s power.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But how can they shut up so swiftly and unanimously like this? It’s really amazing lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ah, but it’s a shame that the 100 million GP sponsorship won’t come anymore lol
 </p>
 <p>
  The messages from the dragons, who were sponsoring 100 million GP while saying the previous tournament was rigged and that they would reward him if he revealed Earth’s coordinates, completely disappeared after Yggdrasil said it scolded them well.
 </p>
 <p>
  And not long after,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dragon Lord has sponsored 100 million GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  […Based on the covenant with the World Tree Elves, from now on, my dragon race and I will not interfere with humanity and Seong Jihan. The sponsorship constellation procedure will also be terminated soon.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Lord’s official declaration of giving up came out.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow, what kind of covenant is it that they surrender in less than 10 minutes??
 </p>
 <p>
  -The dragons totally lost face;
 </p>
 <p>
  -It was known that elves are superior to dragons, but it became officially confirmed today.
 </p>
 <p>
  -The Dragon Lord would need that hand to become a Red Administrator… Is he giving that up?
 </p>
 <p>
  -He’s really on a leash by the elves; Before he was a pet of the Reds and now he’s a pet of the Greens.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But what the heck is that button to make their attitude change so drastically?
 </p>
 <p>
  -I know right… Show it to us too!
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as Seong Jihan took out the button, the situation did a 180-degree turn.
 </p>
 <p>
  The alien viewers began to focus on the red button.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although they initially wondered why such a thing was an EX-grade item,
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as they saw the item information and Yggdrasil being flustered, they suddenly became interested.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  “If I was going to let you all know, I would have revealed it to everyone earlier. Isn’t that right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan cut off the viewers’ curiosity at once and put the World Tree ignition device back into his inventory.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Cosmic Tree Yggdrasil says since it handled it as you said, keep your promise.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, I keep my promises.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Actually, considering how Yggdrasil reacted intensely to the World Tree ignition device,
 </p>
 <p>
  He could have exploited the Green Administrator a bit more with this, but
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should be satisfied with this much for now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If he threatened the Administrator too much, it could backfire instead.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was effective enough just showing that he had such an item this time.
 </p>
 <p>
  For now, it was best to just store it in the inventory and imprint its existence.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Cosmic Tree Yggdrasil says he will trust you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [He adds that this is the first time he was properly threatened despite only making threats so far, and his heart was pounding quite a bit.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [He also says that although he has always been watching you, he will observe you more closely from now on.]
 </p>
 <p>
  -What, why is its heart pounding from being threatened?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is it a pervert, damn it;
 </p>
 <p>
  -Saying it will always watch closely, is it a stalker…?
 </p>
 <p>
  -At this rate, it might even confess later.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Don’t say such unpleasant things —
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Yggdrasil’s last message was a bit icky, Seong Jihan, who had sorted out the situation to some extent,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, right. And,”
 </p>
 <p>
  Added as if he just remembered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Dragon Lord. Maintain the sponsorship constellation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  -??
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why are you leaving him as a sponsoring constellation?
 </p>
 <p>
  -He’s not really helpful…
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers were quite puzzled by Seong Jihan’s words, but
 </p>
 <p>
  “Later, I’m going to invade your lair after making myself a special jerk.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Everyone was shocked at his declaration of invasion.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why are you invading the Dragon Lord’s lair;
 </p>
 <p>
  -The Lord will probably set up proper traps…
 </p>
 <p>
  -That’s why. Is there a need to go?
 </p>
 <p>
  -It’s best to just part ways with the dragon race like this and not see each other…
 </p>
 <p>
  With Yggdrasil’s intervention, the dragon race had already shrunk back.
 </p>
 <p>
  In fact, there was no need to pick fights with them.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Just in case I can’t clear the Great Constellation achievement, I need insurance.’
 </p>

 <p>
  Those dragon bastards kept saying the tournament was rigged.
 </p>
 <p>
  And because the power Seong Jihan showed in the battle with the Dragon Lord’s avatar was so overwhelming,
 </p>
 <p>
  It was still uncertain whether the great constellations would participate in the 3rd tournament.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the participation rate is low and he can’t face the great constellations, he should at least catch the Dragon Lord.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dragon Lord has sponsored 100 million GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Good. Come as much as you want. I will show you hell.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Lord welcomed such words from Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it was inside his own lair, not the tournament with questionable fairness,
 </p>
 <p>
  He could properly beat up that naive human bastard.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having lost a lot of face externally this time, he was hoping Seong Jihan would come.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright, then see you later in your lair.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan answered like that and closed the message window.
 </p>
 <p>
  In front of him, a fierce battle was unfolding between the two sides, excluding him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now that the situation is sorted out, I should level up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who took out his weapon, jumped into the battlefield.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wh-what the…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh? That player…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It-it’s Seong Jihan!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why is that bastard on the enemy side?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I thought he wasn’t here because the game didn’t end right away…”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan charged in, the enemy camp fell into a state of panic.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who had already become famous for his unrivaled strength even in the Challenger League, was voted as the enemy the Challenger players least wanted to face.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because the game would end within 5 minutes whenever he appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, the battle had been going on for quite a while, so they thought Seong Jihan wasn’t here, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was a little busy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the spear and sword drew a trajectory, the opposing players were swept away without even being able to scream.
 </p>
 <p>
  With his full-fledged intervention, it took less than 3 minutes for the situation to be sorted out.
 </p>
 <p>
  -As expected, the main game ends quickly…
 </p>
 <p>
  -?? This isn’t the main game. Making the Dragon Lord shut up was the main game and this is the bonus game lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -It’s really nice to see the dragon bastards being quiet.
 </p>
 <p>
  The matching game that had now become a bonus game ended.
 </p>
 <p>
  Around the time when the viewers were rejoicing at the cleaned-up chat window,
 </p>
 <p>
  […That thing.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Wandering Martial God’s eyes flashed as he saw the item Seong Jihan took out.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God’s Throne located in Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Pythia. Activate the Divine Eye. I will make a future prediction.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. My lord.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Having seen the ‘button’ Seong Jihan took out, Martial God immediately called Pythia and used the Divine Eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzing…
 </p>
 <p>
  The light eyes that appeared on Pythia’s forehead
 </p>
 <p>
  And the light eyes Martial God displayed met each other’s light
 </p>
 <p>
  And created an even larger white sphere between the two.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Will that item become a variable in the great endeavor?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The ‘button’ that made the Green Administrator Yggdrasil follow Seong Jihan’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as Martial God saw that, he instinctively felt an ominous emotion.
 </p>
 <p>
  The future where the variable of ‘losing’ disappeared when Asoka sealed the Red Hand,
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like it would be shaken up because of that thing.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash! Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  At Martial God’s words, the white sphere that had been flashing several times began the prediction.
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzing…
 </p>
 <p>
  As numerous screens tried to appear,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Change the question.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Martial God asked a question to narrow down the variables.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Will it become a variable even if all the power of the relics is used?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzing…
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, most of the screens that had appeared disappeared, leaving only one.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the screen,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who was fighting Martial God, took out the button from his inventory and pressed it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  In an instant, his whole body was engulfed in white flames, and he began to transform into a giant.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the giant Seong Jihan clenched his fist once, Tuseong exploded as it was.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Bzzt…
 </p>
 <p>
  The screen flickered white and disappeared.
 </p>

 <p>
  “T-this is… the Red Administrator…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s right. I wondered why Yggdrasil followed his words… The button had such an effect.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, he got his hands on an absurd item.
 </p>
 <p>
  He thought the possibility of defeat disappeared when the Hand was sealed, but suddenly what kind of bolt from the blue is this?
 </p>
 <p>
  As Martial God’s eyes flashed,
 </p>
 <p>
  “…But, he seems to have become even stronger than before.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia carefully spoke, recalling the scene from a little while ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  “In his previous giant form, although Tuseong was devastated, he fought a battle on top of Tuseong…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. But this time, he destroyed this star with a single gesture.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [This level of strength is surely the power of a ‘Permanent Administrator’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “T-then, just by pressing the button once, he immediately becomes the peak of the universe?”Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  [Right, it’s truly… unfair.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Wandering Martial God answered in a heavy voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was currently repeating tens of thousands of regressions and gathering strength with all his might to rise to the position of Permanent Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  But that bastard can become a Permanent Administrator just by pressing a button once?
 </p>
 <p>
  [That item… can’t be left as it is. Pythia. The summoning of the Tower of Babel must be moved up.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “But, the ban has not ended yet…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Now is not the time to fear punishment.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The button Seong Jihan took out from his inventory made Martial God impatient.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I understand. Then, shall we proceed with the summoning location as planned, where Uruk used to be?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The city of Uruk, ruled by Gilgamesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  This area, currently located in Iraq, was the most suitable land for summoning the Tower of Babel.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  [No. Do it where he lives.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, you mean… in Korea?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “My lord, the efficiency of the tower will be greatly reduced if summoned there…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Currently, Martial God had two main purposes for summoning the Tower of Babel on Earth.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first was to dominate humanity with the tower and absorb their power.
 </p>
 <p>
  The other purpose was to lure Seong Jihan to the tower and send him to Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  But if this was summoned in Korea, not the land where Uruk used to be,
 </p>
 <p>
  Absorbing the power of humanity would become nearly impossible.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Efficiency? In the current situation, efficiency is not important.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Martial God’s attitude was resolute.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Right now, sending Seong Jihan to Tuseong through the tower comes first. To do that, I will endure the loss.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia’s eyes widened at those words.
 </p>
 <p>
  To think the words of enduring loss would come out of Martial God’s mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  She could tell how serious he was about this matter.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I understand. Then… I will prepare right away.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. Then inform Seong Jihan of the tower’s summoning through Gilgamesh. So that he can come.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, Master.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Pythia disappeared after receiving the order,
 </p>
 <p>
  Martial God recalled the scene from a little while ago once again.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Seong Jihan who became a Permanent Administrator…’
 </p>
 <p>
  That appearance was the goal Martial God had yearned for all his life.
 </p>
 <p>
  Repeating tens of thousands of regressions and steadily accumulating strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  The utopia he firmly believed he would one day reach.
 </p>
 <p>
  That bastard could reach it just by pressing a button once, no matter how he thought about it, it was absurd.
 </p>
 <p>
  What was even more ridiculous was,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Why the hell isn’t he pressing that?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing how he shook up Yggdrasil with that, it seemed Seong Jihan also knew to some extent the effect the item would bring.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then why was he just nicely storing that treasure in his inventory?
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how much he thought about it, Seong Jihan was a being he could never understand.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Anyway, it’s fortunate that he’s foolish. This time, I will bring him to Tuseong and end it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Before Seong Jihan’s mind changes, he would quickly deal with it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Around the time Martial God, who saw the button, was showing impatience,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Great Constellation ‘Sun King’ urges you, asking if the Wandering Martial God’s location has not been found out yet.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [He says if he wants to live in the tournament, he should quickly place the solar core where Martial God is. If not, he says he has no choice but to take your arm in the tournament.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who had logged out of the game, was receiving messages from the Sun King.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sun King, who was more interested in the whereabouts of the Wandering Martial God than the tournament where he could take Seong Jihan’s hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Unlike the Dragon Lord, he doesn’t seem to think he will lose in the tournament, which is interesting…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Isn’t obtaining the Red Hand a more urgent matter than Martial God’s whereabouts?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why are you so obsessed with Martial God?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan asked the Sun King for the reason, but
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Great Constellation ‘Sun King’ says you don’t need to know.]
 </p>
 <p>
  He didn’t get an easy answer from him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm. Since I won’t be able to get an answer from him, I should ask a Sun King expert…’
 </p>
 <p>
  If he couldn’t get a direct answer, he had to try to deduce it through a different route.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought of a constellation to ask about this.

  Chapter 449
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sun King’s laboratory.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You actually succeeded this time?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, the Dragon Lord’s head has been successfully transplanted into the 17777th!”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Martial God was created as the Sun King’s 17777th son, he could understand language from the moment he gained self-awareness.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This place…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Twitch.
 </p>
 <p>
  He opened his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the first thing he saw through the glass of the test tube was a white-haired man with a haggard face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Vital signs are stable. There is no sign of rejection from the Dragon Lord’s head. This body has perfectly accepted the transplanted head!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The white-haired man was making a fuss and pointing at him.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then—
 </p>
 <p>
  Screeech…
 </p>
 <p>
  A massive giant with grotesque features and glowing red eyes on its face pushed the white-haired man aside and peered down.
 </p>
 <p>
  The giant’s lips curled into a wide smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well endured, my son.”
 </p>
 <p>
  His voice was gentle and kind.
 </p>
 <p>
  To the newly born child, it sounded just like a father’s love.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the words that followed were in stark contrast to his tone.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your body will carry the name of the Sun King and shine even more brilliantly. I will gladly enter your body today, so be grateful for your birth.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah! For the Master to choose his son so soon… This is unprecedented! 17777th, know that this is an honor!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The white-haired man echoed the giant’s words with zeal.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then he abruptly stopped and flashed a sinister smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, not that it matters since he doesn’t understand a word of this anyway.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Would he stay still if he did? The original host of this body put up quite a resistance to survive.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It is unfortunate considering the time and effort we spent on the 14722nd son…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No need to lament, for once I claim that body, there will be no more need for transitions.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Their conversation didn’t make sense to the newly born child.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Does this mean I’m going to die?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps it was due to having the Dragon Lord’s head transplanted onto him, but the 17777th son could vaguely understand their words.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…’
 </p>
 <p>
  But as he had just been born, understanding their words didn’t mean he had the ability to do anything about it.
 </p>
 <p>
  He could only stay still in the test tube and watch them.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, let’s start with the branding.”
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as the Sun King finished speaking,
 </p>
 <p>
  Sizzle…!
 </p>
 <p>
  A scorching pain erupted from the center of his body, and letters began to engrave themselves onto his chest.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first thing that was engraved was the number 17777.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm, this body is still too small for me to enter. Administer the growth stimulant.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, Master.”
 </p>
 <p>
  No sooner had he spoken,
 </p>
 <p>
  Bubbling…
 </p>
 <p>
  The liquid inside the test tube began to boil.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack. Crack!
 </p>
 <p>
  Every part of the 17777th son’s body started to swell and burst.
 </p>
 <p>
  Beyond the glass of the test tube,
 </p>
 <p>
  A giant head with a snake’s head was trying to grow its eyes but couldn’t.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The body is not developing eyes… are the red eyes clashing with the Dragon Lord’s head?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, it seems so.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We need to allow more time for growth. I’ll give it a week to manifest the eyes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sun King turned his head, satisfied as he looked at the 17777th son.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the father who intended to immediately take over his body leaving,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, Dragon head. Shall we grow a bit larger?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The white-haired man manipulated something with a smile on his face.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Bubbling…
 </p>
 <p>
  The liquid inside the test tube began to boil again.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Four days later.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh dear, the eyes almost formed, then it molted again. This dragon head is really troublesome.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The white-haired man frowned as he looked at the 17777th son.
 </p>
 <p>
  The master, the Sun King, had ordered the growth stimulant to be administered until the eyes formed.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  The body was now large, and the Dragon Lord’s head had grown significantly, making the test tube seem cramped, but still, the crucial red eyes had not appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If this continues, I will face terrible punishment again… Ah, what to do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  While the man was contemplating what to do with the dragon head,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The manifestation of the eyes can’t be delayed any further.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the test tube, the 17777th son realized that he had reached his limit.
 </p>
 <p>
  The entire body had already been branded thoroughly with the Sun King’s marking.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once the red eyes were manifested, the body would be immediately taken over by him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Would it have been better if I didn’t understand?’
 </p>
 <p>
  He didn’t know how the Dragon Lord’s head, which the Sun King coveted so much, worked on him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Within his four days of existence, the 17777th son had developed the capacity to understand language as well as assess his current situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Had he been without consciousness, the Sun King could have claimed the body without protest.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…I will live. I must live somehow.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He couldn’t die right after being born.
 </p>
 <p>
  Driven by a sheer will to live, the 17777th son focused on every aspect of the laboratory’s operations.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  He discovered a possibility.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Tsk, removing another shed skin again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  A large shed skin was sucked into a vortex at the top of the test tube.
 </p>
 <p>
  The skin that had been shed from the giant body with a snake head was ejected onto the floor of the lab.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s see…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The white-haired man squatted down to examine it and,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nothing of value, as expected. To the incinerator with it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Snap!
 </p>
 <p>
  With a snap of his fingers, the shed skin vanished in a flash.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The shed skin takes an exit route…’
 </p>
 <p>
  While the Sun King’s body, of immense importance, could never be allowed to leave, the shed skin was a different story.
 </p>
 <p>
  Initially, the white-haired man had examined each shed skin for research value.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, upon finding nothing of value, he had begun sending them all to the incinerator after a brief inspection.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Escaping via the shed skin is the only option.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Having identified a potential escape route, the next step was figuring out the best way to execute it.
 </p>
 <p>
  But this was overwhelmingly challenging for someone who had been born just a few days ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  Time flowed rapidly by.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No eyes have formed, just three of these.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Three eyes had finally manifested on the body.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please, forgive me…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This won’t do. I can’t enter like this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  For the Sun King, it seemed, three eyes were not enough to meet his standards.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead,
 </p>
 <p>
  “What kind of work have you done? You deserve punishment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When the Sun King’s gaze fell on the white-haired man, he spontaneously combusted.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sizzle. Sizzle!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, M-Master…! I-I’m sorry, I’m so sorry…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Repeatedly burning and regenerating, the white-haired man’s body was engulfed in flames. His screams of agony echoed through the lab, pleading for mercy.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This punishment will last for one day, but if progress is not made by next time, it will be two days.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With those words, the Sun King vanished.
 </p>
 <p>
  From beyond the glass of the test tube, the 17777th son observed the white-haired man burning and regenerating for a full day.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I would rather burn to death… Why do I have to regenerate…! Agh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The man’s screams pierced through the glass for a long time.
 </p>
 <p>
  The 17777th son instinctively turned his gaze away as he watched the scene.
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching a living being burn and regenerate was not something he enjoyed.
 </p>
 <p>
  But then,DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  “You… Moved your gaze sideways to avoid seeing this sight?”
 </p>
 <p>
  From within the flames, the white-haired man’s voice rang out.
 </p>
 <p>
  In disbelief, he saw the 17777th son’s diverted gaze.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You shouldn’t have any consciousness…”
 </p>
 <p>
  His eyes glinted from within the fire.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I wasn’t planning to do harsh experiments since you’re the body the Master would eventually take over, but this changes things, doesn’t it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even amidst the flames, the man grinned sinisterly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Dragon head, let’s conduct a proper experiment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  From that single gaze aversion,
 </p>
 <p>
  His hell began in earnest.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  “My lord, the message has been sent.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Pythia’s words, Martial God emerged from his recollections.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That white-haired researcher… He must be dead by now.’
 </p>

 <p>
  The white-haired man who was in charge of his experiments didn’t seem like an ordinary being, but it was such ancient history that he was unlikely to still be alive.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If he were alive, he would be subjected to the same experiments he inflicted on me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Or worse, a thousand times more painful.
 </p>
 <p>
  Martial God briefly recalled the ordeals he had endured in the test tube and then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shall we send the Tower of Babel now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do it.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Turned his focus back to Pythia.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, he had to concentrate on this task.
 </p>
 <p>
  He could retrieve the white-haired researcher and repay him once he became a Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Then, I will open the portal.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Sigh…
 </p>
 <p>
  As Martial God’s dark energy extended his hand,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The space tore open, revealing the landscape of the Earth within.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Go. Bring him here through the medium of the tower.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I will obey your command, My lord.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  With Pythia and the golden tower slowly disappearing,
 </p>
 <p>
  Footsteps approached from behind Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  Step. Step.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak walked up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Martial God, wouldn’t it be better for me to follow along?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [No, if you go, he might activate the button there. I’ll handle the lure, you prepare the Nine Palaces Eight Trigrams Formation here.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Although he couldn’t guarantee that the Nine Palaces Eight Trigrams Formation could neutralize the button, it was still worth a try.
 </p>
 <p>
  With Martial God’s command, Dongbang Sak bowed and retreated.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This long cycle… I will end it. And in the next cycle,’
 </p>
 <p>
  Martial God looked towards the Earth.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘In the next cycle, I will kill Seong Jihan first.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He thought of how far the variable had escalated things.
 </p>
 <p>
  Determined to ensure this never happened again, he resolved to eliminate Seong Jihan at the beginning of every regression.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Anyway, I can’t find out the location of Tuseong… might as well train.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Having ended today’s game swiftly, Seong Jihan was about to visit the Void Training Room as usual.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since there was still some time until Tuseong’s ban was lifted, he planned to level up and train concurrently to upgrade his strength during that period.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Buzz…
 </p>
 <p>
  His phone vibrated.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Seong Jihan, Martial God plans to act before his ban ends.]
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a message from Gilgamesh, suspected to be held captive by Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Violating the ban? Martial God?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan immediately replied.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Martial God defying the system’s bans… Is that true?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes, Martial God was greatly provoked by the item you revealed last time. He intends to handle it immediately and has ordered the summoning of the Tower of Babel.]
 </p>
 <p>
  If it’s about the item, it must be the World Tree ignition device.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Interesting. Even Yggdrasil couldn’t identify it until I showed the item description.’
 </p>
 <p>
  For Martial God to disregard the system’s ban, it meant he understood the significance of the World Tree ignition device.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Sending Gilgamesh to message me is openly inviting me to the Tower of Babel.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Since they were summoning the tower despite the ban, they would undoubtedly face a penalty, whether minor or severe.
 </p>
 <p>
  Should he take his time and prevent the tower from functioning?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to find out where they’re summoning it first.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If it spawned in the middle of the sea like the previous lab, there’d be no need for an urgent response.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he mulled over this, Seong Jihan sent another message.
 </p>
 <p>
  [So where is the Tower of Babel being summoned? The Middle East?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [No, near your home.]
 </p>
 <p>
  […What?]
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan was momentarily taken aback by the message,
 </p>
 <p>
  Clunk!
 </p>
 <p>
  His door suddenly opened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle, you’re here! Something big happened!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Near Seolleung… something strange is appearing!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Could it be that the tower is being summoned near Seolleung?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…That’s quick.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Now that the once cautious Martial God was acting hastily, things were proceeding quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll go check it out. Have everyone evacuate for now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “O-okay…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan took his phone and immediately left the house.

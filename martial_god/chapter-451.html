  Chapter 451
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ha, you dare to use my own power against me?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh’s voice echoed from the golden tower, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You think I would?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Clank. Clank.
 </p>
 <p>
  The chains began to fully entwine and merge with Gilgamesh’s.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You bastard…]
 </p>
 <p>
  The composure in Gilgamesh’s voice began to disappear.
 </p>
 <p>
  [How are you wielding my power better than me…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who knows. I still can’t use Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit well either.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan rarely had occasion to use Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even when he did use it, it was to extract life force from the eternity within his body.
 </p>
 <p>
  So his understanding of this power was not that deep.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But it seems you know even less than me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [What did you say…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your chains have already been completely consumed by me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whirl!
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh’s chains, which had been sucked into Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods, became Seong Jihan’s possession.
 </p>
 <p>
  They began to take control of the Tower of Babel in reverse.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This guy really has nothing special.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh, who was an easy opponent despite his position as the last Martial God’s disciple.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, the easiest victory was still over the already dealt with Longinus, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  He not only fell far short of Dongbang Sak or Ashoka,
 </p>
 <p>
  The prophet Pythia seemed even more troublesome to deal with.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the first human and recipient of numerous powers, why was this guy so easy?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He must be satisfied with his own powers and didn’t train at all.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As the king of humans, the currently bestowed power of domination would have been sufficient to reign.
 </p>
 <p>
  How much training could he have done separately?
 </p>
 <p>
  Through the chains he had perfectly made his own, Seong Jihan erased the domination code from the Tower of Babel.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then.
 </p>
 <p>
  The light in the golden tower weakened.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The materialized upper part of the tower lost its form again.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, Gilgamesh. What are you doing? Don’t tell me… you’re betraying us again?”
 </p>
 <p>
  When the top of the tower disappeared in an instant, less than a minute after Seong Jihan used Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit,
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia glared at the Tower of Babel.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how she looked at it, she couldn’t understand how Gilgamesh was being pushed back so easily with his own power.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Be-betrayal, no! I desperately tried to hold on too…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Desperately? Isn’t it your power? But how can it be taken over in an instant?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s what I want to know more!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You don’t want to regain your youth, do you? Ha. Then just live as a baldie.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh appealed his grievances, but Pythia didn’t believe his words.
 </p>
 <p>
  She had also put in a lot of effort to send the Tower of Babel to Earth and materialize it.
 </p>
 <p>
  So she never imagined that this tower would be so easily taken over by Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Surely, with Gilgamesh cooperating from the inside, it turned out like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Why are they fighting each other??
 </p>
 <p>
  – They were originally enemies lol
 </p>
 <p>
  – But why did they come when they’re getting beaten so easily by Seong Jihan?
 </p>
 <p>
  – How can a mere Level 8 Constellation compare? He even defeated the Dragon Lord hehe
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan took out the chains in reverse and took control of the tower,
 </p>
 <p>
  And the two Constellations began to fight each other, people were inwardly relieved.
 </p>
 <p>
  They thought if they were unlucky, the Tower of Babel would rise in the middle of Seoul and all the people of Seoul would fall under Gilgamesh’s control.
 </p>
 <p>
  But Seong Jihan’s quick response completely blocked that attempt.
 </p>
 <p>
  – But then will the people of Seoul be controlled by Seong Jihan?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ooh… that’s not bad?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ikr just control us lol
 </p>
 <p>
  – But given Seong Jihan’s personality, I don’t think he’d become a ruler even if asked to…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Yeah, he rarely makes public appearances.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan took control of the Tower of Babel possessing the power of domination, people weren’t worried at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he was someone to reign over humanity in the first place, he would have done so long ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather, there were many chats saying Seong Jihan, who brought victory to humanity and extended their lifespan through race evolution, should just be the ruler.
 </p>
 <p>
  And.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now, everyone come to your senses. Keep your backs turned until the Tower of Babel disappears. Don’t even look towards Seolleung.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who took control of the Tower of Babel, commanded the people to turn their backs using the domination code.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Uh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow… damn. Was I being controlled?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Crazy, the Tower of Babel…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s stay turned around until it’s over quickly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But we can watch the BattleTube, right…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, the people who had been controlled came to their senses and turned their gazes away from the Tower of Babel.

 <p>
  As the hostage situation failed in an instant,
 </p>
 <p>
  Bam!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, this traitor, really…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [No, I’m not!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia kicked the Tower of Babel.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, is that so? Then our Constellation Gilgamesh is an idiot who lost his power to a kid not even in his thirties?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Th-that… that guy is an Irregular, isn’t he!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, Seong Jihan is a unique case. But does it make sense for you to lose your power that you’ve used for years in an instant?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s because you and Martial God took away my strength!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You call that an excuse…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia seemed genuinely furious.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan watched their argument for a moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should deal with Pythia first.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He pointed the tip of his spear at her.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bzzt!
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, red lightning spewed from the spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Euk…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia hurriedly avoided it, but when lightning grazed her arm,
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Her body was instantly engulfed in flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  A firepower that would turn a human into ashes.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There’s no way she’ll die from this.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan quickly approached her.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I have to finish her here.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia was definitely more troublesome than Gilgamesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  She had to be killed on the spot no matter what.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  Murderous intent swirled in Seong Jihan’s eyes, and his spear tip mercilessly spewed flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, even though her body was set ablaze countless times,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seriously… why are you so intense?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia, while burning, was still flashing her divine eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  And somehow avoiding fatal attacks.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Her divine eye is more problematic than the ice sword.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The ice swords Pythia used were completely unable to withstand Seong Jihan’s fire.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the divine eye that read the future was quite troublesome.
 </p>
 <p>
  He couldn’t scatter flames in all directions to leave no room for escape, as Seolleung was right in the middle of Seoul.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘She’s nimble.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned as he watched Pythia slip away like a loach.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You really won’t die.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha, you think I’ll die? No matter how much I dodge, the flames completely burn my whole body.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But you’re enduring well for that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If it weren’t for Martial God’s favor, I would have turned to ashes long ago. To think a Constellation candidate is pushing a Level 8 Constellation this hard, really…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Even while burning countless times, Pythia, who seemed to die but didn’t, suddenly stopped moving.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  After her divine eye flashed once, as if she saw something in the future,
 </p>
 <p>
  Shh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead of avoiding Seong Jihan’s red energy, she created ice swords.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Not dodging and deciding to fight?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Was there a trap?
 </p>
 <p>
  While being cautious, Seong Jihan didn’t miss the opportunity.
 </p>
 <p>
  His spear thrust out quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia’s ice swords initially seemed to gather in front to block it, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  Poof!
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead, the swords pierced Pythia’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  – ??
 </p>
 <p>
  – Why did she stab herself?
 </p>
 <p>
  – W-who knows…
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia’s body was uniformly pierced by the ice swords.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the tip of the phoenix spear followed, penetrating her.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia, pierced by both the ice swords and the flaming spear,
 </p>
 <p>
  “My lord… please…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Called out to Martial God once, then hung her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, the ice energy intensified in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  It even suppressed the phoenix spear’s flames for a moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  Freezing even Seong Jihan’s right arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  A gambit staking her own life by the Level 8 Constellation.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…It’s impressive to restrain the phoenix spear’s flames, but it’s meaningless once I draw out the fire again.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Seong Jihan’s right hand was frozen,
 </p>
 <p>
  There was still room in his Stats.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

 <p>
  He only needed to ignite the fire once more to easily break free from this restraint.
 </p>
 <p>
  The time Pythia bought was a mere 4-5 seconds at most.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘She wouldn’t sacrifice her body just for this…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Did she use the flashing divine eye from earlier to see a future where she had to be stabbed?
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan tried to quickly melt his arm,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Pythia. I won’t forget your hard work.]
 </p>
 <p>
  From the sky, the voice of the wandering Martial God was heard.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Above the Tower of Babel.
 </p>
 <p>
  The crack in space that had been shining golden light had somehow widened.
 </p>
 <p>
  And was now emitting a dark light.
 </p>
 <p>
  And.
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as Martial God finished speaking.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Uh… that in the sky…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Isn’t that Seong Jihan’s technique?
 </p>
 <p>
  From the darkness, a vortex swirled once.
 </p>
 <p>
  And dozens of black hands began to stretch out.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Those, are they Martial God’s hands…?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Not missing the chance while Seong Jihan’s arm was frozen and momentarily immobilized.
 </p>
 <p>
  Martial God’s hands trying to quickly grab him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Was this the future Pythia saw?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘However, I can deal with this much.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Shh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan moved his unharmed left hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, the tip of the Dark Sword Eclipse trembled.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fundamental Divine Arts,
 </p>
 <p>
  Heavenly Dragon Thunder Fire:
 </p>
 <p>
  One Sword Breaks the Sky
 </p>
 <p>
  A single sword strike instantly tore the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  And Martial God’s hands began to be lacerated in several places.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ah, last time he completely removed the hands; are there too many hands this time?
 </p>
 <p>
  – He used Taiji back then to remove them but why isn’t he using that technique now…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ah, maybe because this is in the middle of Seolleung, They sure picked an annoying location.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike last time, Martial God’s hands did not disappear.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the movement of the fiercely outstretched hands paused for a moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I bought this much time, I can pull out my right hand.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan focused his energy on his right hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, the spear and hand simultaneously burst into flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  Squirm.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the intense fire energy, the sealed eyeball on the back of his hand squirmed.
 </p>
 <p>
  But.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Looks like it’s still too early for the seal to be released.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The red hand was still maintaining the seal.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘With this, did it deviate from the future Pythia saw?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Her plan with the divine eye was probably to freeze herself to immobilize Seong Jihan for a bit.
 </p>
 <p>
  And use that gap for Martial God’s hands to try to kidnap him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Their attempt ended up being thwarted much more easily than expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, although the hands in the sky were lacerated by One Sword Breaks the Sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dozens of Martial God’s hands stretched out.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I use the phoenix spear too, I can sufficiently repel that much.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Now that his body was free, Martial God’s hands weren’t that threatening.
 </p>
 <p>
  He needed to quickly burn all of that and erase even the spatial gap.
 </p>
 <p>
  To do that.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll have to use Total Annihilation.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather than directly slashing by consolidating the power of Taiji Sword into Eclipse,
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed better to shoot Total Annihilation towards that space.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan’s right hand burned,
 </p>
 <p>
  Intense energy soared from the phoenix spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator’s power, Total Annihilation.
 </p>
 <p>
  With that strength, no matter how many of Martial God’s hands there were, he could sufficiently eliminate them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, with the Administrator’s hand sealed now.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether he could properly manifest Total Annihilation was the problem.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Total Annihilation… I feel like I can somehow do it even without the hand’s help?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was manifesting the Administrator’s power more easily than expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps because the Stats he obtained from the Dragon Lord were so abundant.
 </p>
 <p>
  Manifesting Total Annihilation seemed even easier than when the hand was awake.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll have to use it often in the future.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan made that resolution and tried to shoot out Total Annihilation,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  From the back of his right hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Main Body.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The closed eyeball opened its eyes.

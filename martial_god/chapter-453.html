  Chapter 453
 </p>
 <p>
  Supernova.
 </p>
 <p>
  A one-time buff that multiplies the effect of the Star buff by ten but penalizes the user by ceasing the divine power effect.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the drastic efficiency reduction due to the absence of divine power, it was a method that should only be unsealed in desperate times.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is the time of desperation.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Facing the giant Martial God in a one-on-one situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  When else would he use the supernova if not now?
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan activated the supernova, his power increased dramatically.
 </p>
 <p>
  The overwhelming momentum of the Martial God and Seong Jihan reached a balance momentarily.
 </p>
 <p>
  [There were still more tricks up your sleeve?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing Seong Jihan, the Martial God’s eyes gleamed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even after amassing such power, the Constellation candidate still resisted to this degree.
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed, he needed to be eliminated now.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Blackish-red light surged once more from the Martial God’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  More relics began to connect with him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…About 500 weapons combined.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In the sky, there were far more relics than just 500.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God connected with about that many and stopped.
 </p>
 <p>
  He claimed to be using his full power but still seemed leisurely.
 </p>
 <p>
  Or.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Maybe 500 is the limit for combining.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Sss…
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God grew even larger.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan who momentarily seemed equal when using the supernova started to falter again.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how many buff methods he had, he couldn’t match the power accumulated through infinite regressions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The longer this drags on, the worse for me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Supernova and Constellation mode.
 </p>
 <p>
  Both had time limits as temporary buff methods.
 </p>
 <p>
  In contrast, the Martial God still had plenty of relics left in the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to use my full power from the start.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Currently, Seong Jihan’s strongest methods were the Taiji Sword and Total Annihilation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although being dragged to Tuseong using Total Annihilation was a downside, he couldn’t let the Stats encoded red idle in the current situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sss…
 </p>
 <p>
  The Taiji emerged behind Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dark Sword Eclipse slid into it.
 </p>
 <p>
  When he pulled his hand out,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  A massive black sword appeared in his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  A Taiji sword more than twice the height of Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Originally a longsword, it had significantly grown due to supernova usage.
 </p>
 <p>
  [A Taiji sword imbued with the essence of the void… Surely, you didn’t make this. Did the Black Administrator give it to you?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan chuckled at the notion that he couldn’t have completed the sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You don’t use the Taiji sword? Oh, maybe you don’t know how?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s a sword I don’t need.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I see, is that so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan aimed the tip of the Taiji sword at the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  The giant black sword looked disproportionately large for a human to wield.
 </p>
 <p>
  But against the enormous Martial God, its presence was insignificant in comparison.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Isn’t the Martial God even larger now?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Yeah, you can see the red eyes from far away, where to even attack?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Seong Jihan has fought many giant creatures, but the Martial God is on a different level.
 </p>
 <p>
  Stomping on the ground of Tuseong and towering over relics, the Martial God’s form.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite Seong Jihan’s massive sword, it seemed no more threatening than a toothpick.
 </p>
 <p>
  And.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I will leave only your right arm intact.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Sss…
 </p>
 <p>
  Blinding light flickered from the relics connected to the Martial God, which all attacked simultaneously.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God’s swift attack aimed at Seong Jihan from all directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Simultaneous execution of the Triad of Martial Mastery?…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Mount Tai Suppression, Way of Immortals, Total Annihilation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Three initial movements of Triad of Martial Mastery peppered Seong Jihan from all sides.
 </p>
 <p>
  Basic techniques in combat, but when executed by 500 relics simultaneously, the destructive force was immense.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sss…!
 </p>
 <p>
  While the Taiji sword blocked the frontal attacks,
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">

 </div>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  It couldn’t cover the rear attacks rushing towards him.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Oh no…!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Seong Jihan’s body… is it sliced?
 </p>
 <p>
  – The Martial God just attacked once!
 </p>
 <p>
  Slicing, splitting, penetrating Seong Jihan’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  The simultaneous Triad of Martial Mastery techniques demonstrated overwhelming power.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fortunately, despite the brutal onslaught,
 </p>
 <p>
  Sss…
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s body quickly regenerated as if time were reversed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Simultaneous use of Triad of Martial Mastery 500 times, huh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eternity had exceptional regenerative power, allowing Seong Jihan’s body to restore even during mutilation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s literally crushing with sheer force.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [As expected, you won’t die easily. But that regeneration…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Sss…
 </p>
 <p>
  The relics moved again.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Can it keep functioning after hundreds and thousands of deaths?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The combined Triad of Martial Mastery techniques rained down upon Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Except for the Taiji sword, nothing seemed to block these attacks.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even the spatial mastery of Martial Soul couldn’t resist the Martial God’s overwhelming power.
 </p>
 <p>
  Standing still would result in continued mutilation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to get close.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With the Taiji sword, Seong Jihan charged forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  To reach the Martial God while the buffs lasted, Seong Jihan launched himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God’s bombardment continued towards Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh! Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  His body repeatedly pierced and regenerated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally, Seong Jihan succeeded in narrowing the gap with the Taiji sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You withstood all these attacks and reached here. You got some drive.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Sss…
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God’s form briefly flickered.
 </p>
 <p>
  [But there’s no need to meet you head-on…]
 </p>
 <p>
  All connections to the relics were severed, and his presence vanished.
 </p>
 <p>
  The hard-earned distance narrowed through brutal bombardment.
 </p>
 <p>
  But his opponent, despite possessing much superior power, chose not to fight head-on.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  From afar, another connection of blackish-red light.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
 </p>
 <p>
  The giant figure of the Martial God re-emerged there.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Did he… really run away?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite having such overwhelming power?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned in disbelief as the distance widened once more.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  The battle between Seong Jihan and the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  A fight expected to be intense turned out to be far different from the viewers’ expectations.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wow… crazy, he’s running away again to avoid getting hit by the black sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Disconnects from the weapons, shrinks, then regrows far away; fighting on home ground is advantageous.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Isn’t he supposed to be the Martial God? Fighting like this is shameful.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Huge but quick, like seriously?
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God kept retreating whenever Seong Jihan closed in.
 </p>
 <p>
  For humans cheering Seong Jihan, this cowardly tactic of the Martial God was infuriating.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Intent on taking no direct hits at all… holding immense power but cautious.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Seems like he’s wearing Seong Jihan down.
 </p>
 <p>
  – The sword is imbued with a terrifying power. No wonder he avoids it…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Entering the realm of the Martial God, Seong Jihan’s fate is almost sealed.
 </p>
 <p>
  – An unpredictably rising human falls here…
 </p>
 <p>

  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  Cowardly as it seemed, retreating far away with overwhelming strength demonstrated the Martial God’s tactical superiority in alien viewers’ eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  And.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I’m dragged around like this, the buffs will expire.’
 </p>
 <p>
  After witnessing the same tactic twice, Seong Jihan realized this was not sustainable.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Void decreases by 10.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Maintaining the Taiji sword was depleting the Void stat.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stat ‘Eternity’ decreases by 1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Due to countless mutilations and regenerations, the Eternity stat was also diminishing.
 </p>
 <p>
  If this dragged on, he risked self-destruction.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Should I shake him with the World Tree ignition device?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The device that caused the Martial God’s actions against orders.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan considered taking it out,
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  His body was pierced again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Taking it out now risked the Martial God’s Triad of Martial Mastery techniques breaking it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even earlier, the solar core had disappeared with a mere gesture.
 </p>
 <p>
  He needed a sure means of protection before taking it out.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Protection means…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Blocking incoming attacks and taking some hits, Seong Jihan pondered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Until now, he relied on Eternity’s regeneration and Martial Soul, focusing on offense rather than defense.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, he needed strong defense to fend off Triad of Martial Mastery techniques and utilize the ignition device.
 </p>
 <p>
  That would allow him to hinder the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he looked for ways to fend off the Martial God’s onslaught,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Let’s try that.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  He lit a white flame.
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s… a flame?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the white flame, the Martial God momentarily hesitated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan infused it with the energy of life.
 </p>
 <p>
  The white flame turned red, transforming into sacred flame.
 </p>
 <p>
  The fire began to emit destruction codes in all directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’re even using sacred flame…]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God’s relaxed demeanor changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Triad of Martial Mastery techniques rushed hastily towards Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssss!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God’s assault was blocked by the destruction codes created by the sacred flame.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the contrary.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The sacred flame continued to expand its reach.
 </p>
 <p>
  As long as Stat red and life energy were supplied, the sacred flame would keep growing.
 </p>
 <p>
  But.
 </p>
 <p>
  [No need to spare the right arm, the hand’s seal preserved… no more need for restraint.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Snap…!
 </p>
 <p>
  After the sacred flame spread,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God enhanced the Triad of Martial Mastery techniques beyond their previous form.
 </p>
 <p>
  500 relics launched various trajectories of attack, compressing the expanding sacred flame.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So he was holding back earlier, prioritizing the hand.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed, the Martial God seemed to weaken the attacks until now, trying not to destroy the administrator’s hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The difference in power is overwhelming.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the limited expansion of the sacred flame, Seong Jihan looked up.
 </p>
 <p>
  The relics powering the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  So far, constrained by the supernova time limit, his target had been the main body of the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Martial God can’t be pursued in this state.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the attacks intensify with the sacred flame spread, Seong Jihan was convinced.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God had more reserve power.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he kept attacking against the time constraint, he’d end up just chasing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead, it seemed better to destroy the relics empowering him.
 </p>
 <p>
  He could attempt to shake the Martial God with the ignition device later if that failed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s save the sacred flame and target the relics for now. If that doesn’t work, use the ignition device.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan swiftly decided and ascended towards the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  As he moved towards the relics,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Where do you think you’re going?]
 </p>
 <p>
  relics unconnected to the Martial God moved simultaneously.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unable to launch coordinated attacks like those linked to the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  But penetrating on their own, each celestial weapon’s attack was formidable.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  The Taiji sword shielded Seong Jihan’s front, blocking all the attacks.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Taiji sword reliably guarded the front.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan ascended swiftly, he swung the massive sword at the relics.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssss…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Momentarily blocking the Taiji sword’s attack, the relics started to crack under the pressure.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This guy…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  And soon.
 </p>
 <p>
  The brilliant celestial weapon shattered, releasing immense power.
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed, it was the energy supporting and strengthening the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Even shattered, its power was this great, originally much stronger.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The spreading force touched the sacred flame multiple times.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stat ‘Martial Soul’ increases by 20.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stat ‘Red’ increases by 15.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Absorbing the celestial weapon’s energy through sacred flame, Seong Jihan’s stats increased.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Stats increased like this?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s eyes gleamed seeing the stat rise.

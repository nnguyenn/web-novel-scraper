  Chapter 454
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan gazed at the relics floating in the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  Countless weapons by the looks of it.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he could destroy them and gain their stats,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Even if the buff ends, there wouldn’t be a problem. I might even become stronger.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It felt like a treasure trove.
 </p>
 <p>
  Previously, he couldn’t stand the sight of the relics that endlessly cut him down, but they suddenly seemed beautiful.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I absorb them with sacred flame instead of breaking them with the Taiji sword, wouldn’t I become even stronger?’
 </p>
 <p>
  So far, he had only absorbed the residual energy after breaking them with the Taiji sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he directly absorbed the abilities while holding the relics, he might grow stronger much faster.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Gotta test it right away.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan swiftly approached the relics.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing him try to grab the weapons floating in the sky without using the Taiji sword,
 </p>
 <p>
  […Are you planning to burn them with sacred flame?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The quick-witted Martial God immediately drew back the relics.
 </p>
 <p>
  The weapons, avoiding Seong Jihan, flew far away on their own.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘His response is fast, as always.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Nevertheless, moving as quickly as he could, Seong Jihan managed to catch one of the relics nearby with sacred flame.
 </p>
 <p>
  Initially, the constellation weapon withstood the flames of the sacred flame,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Strengthen it more.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan poured tremendous power into the sacred flame without reservation.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stat ‘Red’ decreases by 10.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stat ‘Eternity’ decreases by 1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Even Eternity, as well as Red, decreased dramatically.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoooosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the flames blazed fiercely, they ultimately engulfed the constellation weapon, absorbing its abilities.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stat ‘Martial Soul’ increases by 80.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stat ‘Red’ increases by 65.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The overwhelmingly increased stats.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So, I consumed 1 of Eternity to greatly enhance Martial Soul and Red.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, it’s a net gain of 55 for Red.
 </p>
 <p>
  He sacrificed 1 of Eternity, but his stats increased by 135 collectively.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s an incredibly favorable exchange ratio.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Reducing Eternity will diminish my regenerative abilities soon. I can’t use this recklessly.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Surviving the Martial God’s relentless attacks was greatly due to his Eternity trait.
 </p>
 <p>
  Continuously consuming it to absorb stats posed significant danger.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had to know when to stop.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan pondered over how many more to absorb,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God, who had distanced himself, was now approaching him.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your power has increased. You’ve absorbed abilities from my weapons with sacred flame.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Zing…!
 </p>
 <p>
  A bright light shimmered in the Martial God’s crimson eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  With his divine eye activated, the Martial God could see through Seong Jihan’s transformation at a glance.
 </p>
 <p>
  This guy indeed possesses many skills.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan quietly observed the Martial God’s much larger divine eye, then spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Have you given up on running away?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Run away?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the enormous Martial God spread his arms,
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackling!
 </p>
 <p>
  Strange patterns began to spread across the sky and earth.
 </p>
 <p>
  – What is that?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ah… isn’t that the sealing that Seong Jihan used before?
 </p>
 <p>
  – It looks similar, but the scale is on a different dimension…
 </p>
 <p>
  A massive sealing formation, covering the sky and earth completely, known as Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even while bombarding him with attacks, he had prepared this separately.
 </p>
 <p>
  Strength must be overflowing in him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But I don’t feel anything being sealed.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the magnificent presence of the grand sealing formation, Seong Jihan didn’t feel restricted.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like just an enormous pattern had spread across this desolate star.
 </p>
 <p>
  What the Martial God aimed to seal wasn’t Seong Jihan himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  [With this, your device is now useless.]
 </p>
 <p>
  His target was to neutralize the World Tree ignition device.
 </p>
 <p>
  If Seong Jihan used it, it would be the only condition for the Martial God’s defeat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm, is that so? Do you really think the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams sealed it? Inventory.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan extended his hand into the void.
 </p>
 <p>
  Signaling to take something out of the inventory.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment, a powerful offensive wave from the Martial God rushed toward Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Relics attacked, and,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God’s massive hand reached to grab Seong Jihan directly.

 </div>
 <p>
  Crackle…!
 </p>
 <p>
  When it touched the Martial God’s hand, even the destruction code began to collapse.
 </p>
 <p>
  The main body’s power was enough to break through the sacred flame’s defense.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Didn’t you say it’s sealed by Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams? Why so hasty?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan dodged back, smirking.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though he reached into his inventory, he hadn’t actually taken anything out.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
 </p>
 <p>
  “I didn’t bring anything out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […You…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Despite spreading Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams, you still worried it might not work?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You bastard…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God, revealing his true intentions, trembled.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite sealing it with Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams, the World Tree ignition device could act differently since it wasn’t a typical item.
 </p>
 <p>
  Activating it could break through the sealing formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Naturally, the cautious Martial God would have to respond even to such gestures.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Then, he wouldn’t run away again like before.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan infused more power into the Taiji sword, thrusting it toward the Martial God’s hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to the giant Martial God’s hand, the Taiji sword looked no more threatening than a toothpick.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like stabbing it wouldn’t even draw a drop of blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the void-infused sword was so powerful that the Martial God had been avoiding clashes with it until now.
 </p>
 <p>
  But now,
 </p>
 <p>
  Shielded by the sacred flame for defense, Seong Jihan,
 </p>
 <p>
  Teasing with the switch, he couldn’t retreat anymore.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  [… I’ll crush you with your sword.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, instead of retreating, the Martial God stretched his hand toward Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  His hand, so enormous, felt like darkness descending from the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, as Seong Jihan’s sword pierced its center,
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The darkened hand began to split open.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the crack extended,
 </p>
 <p>
  Not only through his hand but also along his arm,
 </p>
 <p>
  Reaching up to his shoulder, creating a massive rift.
 </p>
 <p>
  [What is this power…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  A single touch of the sword,
 </p>
 <p>
  Lifted the dark veil, revealing the form of the Martial God’s arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wow…
 </p>
 <p>
  – The sword actually works…
 </p>
 <p>
  – So that’s why the Martial God was avoiding it!
 </p>
 <p>
  – The power of that black sword is no joke;
 </p>
 <p>
  While the humans cheered at Seong Jihan’s counterattack after a period of one-sided defense,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The darkness completely retreated from the Martial God’s arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  Exposing his form.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  – Is that the Martial God’s arm?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Why does it have so many eyes embedded in it?
 </p>
 <p>
  What the viewers saw was a giant’s arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  An arm with red skin, covered with countless eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Another eye giant? Hilarious.
 </p>
 <p>
  – But the eyes look dead.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Why does it have so much graffiti on it?
 </p>
 <p>
  – It’s not graffiti. Seems more like characters in a similar arrangement.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having watched Seong Jihan’s channel for a long time, human viewers were somewhat familiar with the red eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God’s arm resembled that of the Blood clan.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the eyes had lost their light and appeared dead,
 </p>
 <p>
  With some dense characters engraved all over, unlike typical members of the Blood clan
 </p>
 <p>
  While regular people couldn’t read the characters,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The 17777th son of the Sun King…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan could.
 </p>
 <p>
  The 17777th son of Sun King’s was etched all over the Martial God’s arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the letters crammed into every inch of the giant arm, he felt a sense of maniacal obsession.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If even the Martial God’s power can’t erase it, I understand why he’s wary of the Sun King.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite having the upper hand, sending Dongbang Sak to intercept the Sun King hurriedly,
 </p>
 <p>
  He feared facing the Sun King and potentially obeying his command.
 </p>
 <p>
  Losing his power to the Sun King would mean truly giving away all he had worked for.
 </p>
 <p>
  [To reveal my weakness to the world…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Indeed, the 17777th son of the Sun King.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Can you read this text?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s readable, isn’t it? The King must love his son. Such graffiti everywhere.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ha…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s mockery,
 </p>
 <p>
  Rumble…
 </p>
 <p>
  The ground of Tuseong began to shake violently.
 </p>
 <p>
  The earthquake didn’t affect Seong Jihan in the air,
 </p>
 <p>
  But,
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  Buzz…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Dark crimson light shot from the relics, converging on the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Far more than 500 now…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Previously, the Martial God maintained the connection with just 500 weapons.
 </p>
 <p>
  But after revealing his arm in anger,
 </p>
 <p>
  He connected all the relics to himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Martial God’s body swirled with tremendous power,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is he going to grow until he reaches the end of the universe…?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Before he could absorb more power, Seong Jihan decided to attack the Martial God with the Taiji sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  Before he could strike with the sword again,
 </p>
 <p>
  The enormous Martial God’s body suddenly scattered into darkness and vanished.
 </p>
 <p>
  – ??
 </p>
 <p>
  – Where did he go?
 </p>
 <p>
  – The light connecting to the weapons disappeared too?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Did he run away? haha
 </p>
 <p>
  – Did he absorb too much power and explode?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the sudden disappearance of the Martial God, the viewers speculated about his whereabouts.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmmm…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Shooosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Hovering in the air, Seong Jihan squinted his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  A massive gravitational pull concentrated on him from the center of Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had blocked countless attacks from the Martial God,
 </p>
 <p>
  But the pull from the star’s core was too strong.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What is this…!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Falling to the ground,
 </p>
 <p>
  Crash!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s body smashed into the earth.
 </p>
 <p>
  He regenerated after being shattered by the fall,
 </p>
 <p>
  Blinking his eyes and looking up.
 </p>
 <p>
  The brilliant relics,
 </p>
 <p>
  Between them, two red lights,
 </p>
 <p>
  Menacingly gleamed at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Like eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’ve exposed my weakness to the entire world, Seong Jihan.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You… are you the Martial God?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Staring at the two red lights in the sky, Seong Jihan spoke in a trembling voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the giant connected to the 500 weapons earlier already seemed impossible to defeat.
 </p>
 <p>
  But when he pierced with the Taiji sword, it seemed to do some damage, giving him hope.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No… this is hopeless.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Lying in the ground, Seong Jihan instinctively knew.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God’s star, Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  The star itself had now merged with the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Before I became an administrator, merging with Tuseong… this is outside my plan.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Rumble…
 </p>
 <p>
  The land quaked, and Seong Jihan’s arms and legs began to sink into the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan resisted, but the power of the Martial God merging with the star,
 </p>
 <p>
  Was in a different league than before.
 </p>
 <p>
  Only his head and the Taiji sword remained above the earth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Everything else was bound by the land.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘When we first encountered, he said he would use his full power. That wasn’t his full power at all.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God had become one with Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was his true full power.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the displayed power of the Martial God,
 </p>
 <p>
  Was so overwhelming that even Seong Jihan couldn’t muster the will to resist.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I will never let you die peacefully.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Proclaimed the Martial God, now merged with Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  Given his personality, if he said it to this extent, he was surely planning something very cruel.
 </p>
 <p>
  It might be better to end his life himself before that.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s eyes momentarily lost hope.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…No, I’ll find a way out.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He rekindled his determination.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how hopeless the situation seemed, he couldn’t just die here.
 </p>
 <p>
  As his left hand, which held the Taiji sword, was relatively free from the earth’s binding,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Using the sword to free my body, I can shake him with the World Tree ignition device…!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even while being buried in the ground,
 </p>
 <p>
  He sought a way to counter the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he died here, everything would end.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how bleak it seemed, he had to forcefully find a path.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Yes. If the Martial God became the star, I’ll destroy the star…!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Now that he became the star, he couldn’t run as before.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan rekindled his fighting spirit,
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud. Thud.
 </p>
 <p>
  Footsteps approached from behind him.
 </p>
 <p>
  And soon.
 </p>
 <p>
  “O Martial God.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A low voice echoed.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was Ashoka.

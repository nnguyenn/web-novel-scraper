  Chapter 455
 </p>
 <p>
  – No… this can’t be happening.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ashoka arrived in this state… Is it really the end?
 </p>
 <p>
  – That constellation can turn back time. Did the Martial God summon him to truly torture us?
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka, the third disciple of the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers who watched him in the tournament were plunged into complete despair.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he, who showcased unmatched strength even unbefitting a Level 8 Constellation, interferes now,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who stands with no hope, will surely meet his end.
 </p>
 <p>
  […Why are you here? I did not summon you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the Martial God did not welcome his arrival.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka didn’t appear while Seong Jihan was resisting.
 </p>
 <p>
  Only now, after the Martial God had suppressed him by merging with the star, did he show up.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he had come earlier, the Martial God wouldn’t have needed to merge with the star to subdue Seong Jihan more easily.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s already concluded. What do you intend to do now?’
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Martial God’s two eyes in the sky began to glow red,
 </p>
 <p>
  “There are too many spectators this time. It has become impossible to reverse the great flow.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka spoke an unexpected truth.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You say, it cannot reverse the flow…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Though Ashoka framed it as an inability to reverse the great flow,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God quickly understood that this hinted at regression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Too many are observing this place through Seong Jihan’s channel. Moreover, among them, all administrators are included, making it impossible to ignore the spectators and reverse the flow.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, it means regression isn’t possible?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, embedded in the ground, smirked at the conversation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then you’ve blocked infinite regression. That’s fortunate?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Infinite regression? How do you know about that…]
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s words, the ground aggressively engulfed his body once more.
 </p>
 <p>
  As if binding weren’t enough, the earth began to crush all his tissues.
 </p>
 <p>
  The overwhelming pressure on Seong Jihan would have killed an ordinary player many times over.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stat ‘Eternity’ decreases by 1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  His body, already torn and regenerated countless times, consumed another point of Eternity.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God could kill him in an instant if he wanted to.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan contorted his face upon seeing the message about the decreasing Eternity stat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you press me like this, I can’t answer.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […Speak now. Immediately.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The ground’s pressure eased slightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wouldn’t consume Eternity for now.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though, as soon as he answered, the Martial God would likely resume his crushing pressure.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘To buy a little more time, I should say something.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking this, Seong Jihan recalled Ashoka, who revealed the secret of infinite regression.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Ashoka didn’t help at all this time…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Though he promised to cooperate with Seong Jihan and Dongbang Sak against the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead of helping, Dongbang Sak nearly became an obstacle earlier.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, the situation might not have been favorable for cooperation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your infinite regression was told to me by the ghosts sacrificed to you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […Could it be the Abyss owner?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan sold out the already dead and vanished Abyss owner.
 </p>
 <p>
  After all, it wasn’t entirely false.
 </p>
 <p>
  And in response.
 </p>
 <p>
  […That troublesome guy even in death. I’ll take care of the Abyss in the next regression.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God, eyeing Seong Jihan, turned his gaze back to Ashoka.
 </p>
 <p>
  [So, what’s the plan?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “We need the administrator’s hand for now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Right. It’s time to retrieve the hand.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Rumble…
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God dragged Seong Jihan out from the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  Szzzz!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  He severed Seong Jihan’s right arm in one swift motion.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though the administrator’s hand was much sturdier compared to Seong Jihan’s body,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God’s power, after merging with the star, was overwhelming, cutting it off effortlessly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The floating hand and arm quickly ascended up to where the eyes of the Martial God were.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once the severed arm reached near the Martial God’s eyes,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The administrator’s hand began to burn with intense red flames.
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  [This is…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Amidst the Martial God’s moment of confusion,
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  The administrator’s hand exploded near his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  The explosion was significant, momentarily engulfing the Martial God’s eyes in flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssss…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s severed right arm rapidly regenerated.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now! Do it now!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The flaming hand then spoke with a red eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What the… I thought you were severed? Why are you back?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “My main body and I are now inseparably linked. We are connected as one!”
 </p>
 <p>
  What on earth is this nonsense?
 </p>
 <p>
  Had it fused with his body so thoroughly?
 </p>
 <p>
  To the point where severing it was useless?
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s… quite disturbing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Disturbing? Main body, you’re too harsh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Too harsh? Because of you, I’m in this mess.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pop!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan jabbed the eyeball on the right hand with his left finger.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fzzz…
 </p>
 <p>
  The flames wrapped around the right hand weakened, and the administrator’s hand spoke apologetically.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh, sorry. The Martial God was stronger than I thought. I didn’t expect he wouldn’t give you time to press the switch.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you crazy? Sorry doesn’t fix this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Instead, I’ll delay him so you can push the button. Watch this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Flames flared up from the hand again, and destruction codes floated around.
 </p>
 <p>
  Layers of destruction codes, even more concentrated than before.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though it couldn’t completely fend off the overwhelming power of the Martial God,
 </p>
 <p>
  “This should buy enough time to press the ignition device!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Plenty of time to hit the button.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Inventory.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan immediately took out the World Tree ignition device from the inventory.
 </p>
 <p>
  A red button protruded on a purple plate.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to its description,
 </p>
 <p>
  Pressing it would ignite the World Tree on Earth, consuming all of humanity in sacred flames and transferring their red stats to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  By pressing it only once.
 </p>
 <p>
  He could ascend to become the red administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…My instincts, stronger than ever, are telling me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The intuition guiding Seong Jihan so far was urging him to press the button strongly upon seeing it.
 </p>
 <p>
  That he’d survive only by doing so.
 </p>
 <p>
  That no other choice existed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘With my current level, I can’t contend with the Martial God’s strength.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God had amassed power through infinite regressions, stockpiling in relics.
 </p>
 <p>
  These weapons, already countless.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mobilizing all this power and merging with the star made victory impossible by any means.
 </p>
 <p>
  To escape here,
 </p>
 <p>
  And to ultimately triumph over the Martial God, pressing the button was the only means left.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dare you struggle here…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle!
 </p>
 <p>
  The destruction code was quickly vanishing under the Martial God’s relentless pressure.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the Martial God merged with the star,
 </p>
 <p>
  The world itself turned against Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Martial God’s crushing pressure continued, even the destruction created by the red hand would soon dissipate.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Main body! What are you doing? Why didn’t you push it yet?! We’ll all die like this!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you worried about humanity burning? We’re not sacrificing them. They’ll all become part of the transcendence!”
 </p>
 <p>
  – ?? What’s he talking about?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Why would we burn?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Yeah, what happens if he presses that…?
 </p>
 <p>
  Confused human viewers began to get an idea from the red hand’s outcry.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, come on. If you hesitate, I’ll press it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  With Seong Jihan merely holding the device in his left hand, his right hand started to move toward the button on its own.
 </p>
 <p>
  The red hand, acting on its own will, guided the right hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  But.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  “Stop.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Ashoka approached from behind Seong Jihan and spoke,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  The hand withdrew, returning to its original position.
 </p>
 <p>
  The power of Ashoka, who could turn back time, manifested.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ashoka! Well done!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God, anxious about the button being pressed, exclaimed in joy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Szzzz…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The destruction code began to disappear at an accelerated speed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan seemed about to be caught by the Martial God’s power again.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ah… it’s over.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Would it have been better if Seong Jihan had pressed the button…?
 </p>
 <p>
  – No, I don’t want to die…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Die and be revived?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Is there any guarantee of being revived?
 </p>
 <p>
  As the final hope dissipated,
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers felt the end approaching.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan, even in this situation, you didn’t press it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, yeah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, if I became a permanent administrator and…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the button.
 </p>
 <p>
  A device that could save his life.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even now, if he extended his left finger, the World Tree would immediately burn.
 </p>
 <p>
  But.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Would I have revived my family, humanity, if I became a Administrator?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You wouldn’t have. As a permanent administrator, you would surpass the self called Seong Jihan. As the red administrator, you would see this as a foolish mortal thought and forget humanity.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s why I didn’t press it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Humanity existed to make the red administrator a permanent administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  Burning them to become a permanent administrator meant fulfilling the purpose of their existence.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, a permanent administrator, Seong Jihan would never revive that race.
 </p>
 <p>
  No.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once becoming a permanent administrator, the self called Seong Jihan would cease to exist.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…But, it might have been different. You could have fully retained yourself and revived humanity. You might have even crushed the star. You gave up those possibilities.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so? Thinking that way makes it seem regrettable.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Crunch!
 </p>
 <p>
  Underneath the button on the World Tree ignition device,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan tightly gripped the plate.
 </p>
 <p>
  It quickly cracked,
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The World Tree ignition device shattered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “To abandon regrets, I must destroy it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  From the shattered ignition device,
 </p>
 <p>
  Massive void and red power surged out, touching Seong Jihan’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stat ‘Void’ increases by 150.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stat ‘Red’ increases by 50.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Absorbing only a portion of the energy from the ignition device resulted in significant stat increases.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, considering it meant giving up becoming a permanent administrator,
 </p>
 <p>
  This was too small a reward.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ha ha! You’re insane. Truly insane…! Sacrifice your race? Family? You give up becoming a permanent administrator for such things?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God laughed in triumph.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… insane… I can’t believe this is my main body… ha… let’s die. Just die.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The red hand closed its eye in despair.
 </p>
 <p>
  But then.
 </p>
 <p>
  Step. Step.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Sorry. I tested you until the end.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In front of Seong Jihan,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka walked forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You broke the device, showing your will.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssss…CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
 </p>
 <p>
  Behind him, a golden wheel appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So I shall respond.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Szzzz!
 </p>
 <p>
  From there, dark red shadows began to spread.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thousand Hands, Thousand Eyes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon, a thousand shadowy hands rose,
 </p>
 <p>
  Guarding Seong Jihan’s front.

  Chapter 456
 </p>
 <p>
  […Ashoka.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God’s voice, initially agitated when Seong Jihan shattered the button, now grew icy cold.
 </p>
 <p>
  [So, you intended to defy me all along.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you already foresee this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Indeed… you were always a threat to me on Earth.]
 </p>
 <p>
  When the Martial God plotted his schemes on Earth,
 </p>
 <p>
  Those who consistently thwarted his plans were Dongbang Sak and Ashoka.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among them, Dongbang Sak had the stronger power.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the one who always disrupted his plans was Ashoka.
 </p>
 <p>
  [When you first pretended to cooperate with me, I knew you harbored other intentions. So when you became my follower, I prepared something just for you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I thought I would use it in the distant future, but to think you would choose to rebel now…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka’s betrayal, which the Martial God had anticipated would happen eventually.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the timing was much sooner than expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, now the Martial God was at the peak of his power, having merged with the star.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if Ashoka had intentions of rebellion, now would have been the wise time to lay low.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet he chose to unsheathe his sword at such a time?
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God, observing Thousand Hands and Thousand Eyes, then focused on Seong Jihan behind him.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Don’t tell me you acted to save Seong Jihan… forsaking the chance to become a permanent administrator?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “It was precisely for that reason that I chose him.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The one who once threatened me now chooses to die for a foolish mortal emotion… Your wisdom has truly dimmed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Ashoka who had once caused him so much trouble,
 </p>
 <p>
  Now throwing away his life to save a human whom the Martial God considered a fool.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God, unable to comprehend, stared at the two humans.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Having merged with Tuseong, you can no longer harm me. You know this better than anyone… truly foolish.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka, hearing the Martial God’s call him foolish, lifted one foot.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thump!
 </p>
 <p>
  As his foot sank into the ground,
 </p>
 <p>
  Rumble…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The terrain of Tuseong began to shake.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike when the Martial God controlled the star,
 </p>
 <p>
  Simultaneously, the ground split open.
 </p>
 <p>
  From within, a golden light began to seep out.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This is…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have destroyed the Tower of Babel at the heart of this land. Your connection with the star is now severed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At his words, the eyes of the Martial God, floating in the sky, flickered.
 </p>
 <p>
  [How did you manage that… with what power…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “It is not only you who have accumulated power through infinite regressions.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [What…?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang! Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  From all sides, golden light erupted.
 </p>
 <p>
  When the shadowy hand of Thousand Hands and Thousand Eyes touched it,
 </p>
 <p>
  The hands gleamed with a golden radiance, shining brilliantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The intensity was so powerful that even the Martial God, who had become one with Tuseong, couldn’t suppress it.
 </p>
 <p>
  For the first time since arriving on this star, Seong Jihan felt entirely free from the Martial God’s pressure.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wow… what’s happening…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Insane… he’s so strong…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Why didn’t he act sooner… haha…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ashoka’s real name was Siddhartha, wasn’t it?? Is there no record of this man?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Nothing special there
 </p>
 <p>
  – This version of Thousand Hands Thousand Eyes seems like the Bodhisattva one.
 </p>
 <p>
  – For today, he’s as good as the Bodhisattva.
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers, who were anticipating Seong Jihan’s death, were now cheering at the sudden reversal of the situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was wondering when you would come to help.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, finally catching his breath, smirked.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka.
 </p>
 <p>
  Had he also been accumulating power while the Martial God was performing infinite regressions?
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed, he was a fitting opponent of the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If Dongbang Sak joins forces with Ashoka, maybe we can defeat him here on this star.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If Ashoka and Dongbang Sak, the two supreme beings that the Martial God feared, teamed up effectively, the problem might resolve more easily than expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It would be great if they took down the Martial God without me having to intervene… or even without me putting my spoon in. Just kill that jerk.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Having been summoned to Tuseong and having his body shredded thousands of times by the Martial God, Seong Jihan was ready to sit back and let the two constellations handle it.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  But,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing Seong Jihan relax, Ashoka spoke in a low tone.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan, be ready.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ready for what?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You have to kill me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  What, am I mad? Why would I kill my savior?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at Ashoka in shock.
 </p>
 <p>
  But Ashoka kept a peaceful expression, turning his gaze behind him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Look at my Golden Wheel.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This skeleton wheel? Why?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka’s Golden Wheel.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a huge wheel.
 </p>
 <p>
  Its ends were composed of 99 golden skulls, with the interior made of red bones.
 </p>
 <p>
  And Ashoka’s Thousand Hands Thousand Eyes spread from it, using it as the central point of his power.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Golden Wheelwas indeed the core source of Ashoka’s power.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Some skulls have turned black, haven’t they?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Correct, it’s now the sixth one.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “When all the skulls turn black, I will die.”
 </p>
 <p>
  What?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, surprised by his words, closely observed the Golden Wheel.
 </p>
 <p>
  The seventh skull too was quickly turning black.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wouldn’t take long for all 99 golden skulls to turn black.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You heard before, didn’t you? The Martial God said he had prepared something due to his wariness of me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That… changes the golden skulls to black?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite his impending death, Ashoka remained calm, moving Thousand Hands Thousand Eyes to break the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Before I die, I will tell you about Tuseong’s secrets.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Secrets…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The cores forming Tuseong are the relics and the Tower of Babel. I have definitely destroyed the Tower of Babel, but the Martial God may rebuild it at any time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom! Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  As Ashoka began explaining to Seong Jihan, the relics in the sky all glinted.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ashoka… A forbidden rule has been triggered. How are you still alive and speaking!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The enraged Martial God launched an all-out attack.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thousand Hands Thousand Eyes enveloped Seong Jihan and Ashoka to defend against the assault.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So that’s why the Martial God’s attacks were restrained earlier, due to the administrator’s hand.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If the Martial God had unleashed such power on Seong Jihan earlier,
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter the Eternity power, he would have already been pulverized.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crash…!
 </p>
 <p>
  As a giant bolt pierced through Thousand Hands Thousand Eyes,
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Martial God is in haste. That’s a good sign.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Snap.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka clicked his fingers to stop it and resumed his discourse.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Tower of Babel is a means to store power during infinite regressions and a conduit for the Martial God’s control over Tuseong. You must ensure it is not rebuilt.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…How should I do that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Secure the original owner of the Tower of Babel.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The original owner, probably Gilgamesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though he seemed useless, the Tower of Babel must be critical.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing Seong Jihan nod, Ashoka smiled.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The relics are storage vessels preserving power after each regression. Dongbang Sak will resolve much of this.]
 </p>
 <p>
  While he had been speaking, Ashoka reverted to sending messages about the relics as before.
 </p>
 <p>
  Probably to avoid alerting the Martial God of Dongbang Sak’s betrayal.
 </p>
 <p>
  So then.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So even what he has been speaking about so far, the Martial God could hear…’
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan pondered over this,
 </p>
 <p>
  “The relics have consumed over 10% of their power, merging with the Martial God. And severing their link with the Tower of Babel will further reduce it by 10%.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka pointed his finger upward.
 </p>
 <p>
  Cracks appeared on the countless golden hands that had guarded Seong Jihan and Ashoka.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God’s relentless attacks endlessly battered it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Breaking Thousand Hands Thousand Eyes like this would make the Martial God burn another 10% of his power.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Damn you…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t my calculation precise, Martial God?”
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  [It’s accurate… indeed, impressively accurate! Killing you now turns out to be quite a blessing for me!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite his anger, the Martial God acknowledged Ashoka’s precision.
 </p>
 <p>
  So by this calculation,
 </p>
 <p>
  Summoning the Martial God to merge with Tuseong reduced 10% of his power.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka alone had diminished another 20%.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Still, 70% remains… Martial God is resilient.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hence you must kill me and seize my power.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka spoke again, asking Seong Jihan to kill him.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he was fated to die due to the forbidden rule,
 </p>
 <p>
  He intended to pass his power.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan bit his lip.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…How much power will I gain by killing you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You have the sacred flame, don’t you? If you take my power, you won’t be as helpless as before against the Martial God.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Burn his savior with sacred flame?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan let out a long sigh.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You must do it. Seong Jihan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Understood. I’ll do it when you say.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Ashoka reemphasized, Seong Jihan eventually agreed to follow him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as their conversation was wrapping up,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do you think I will let events unfold as you wish?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God’s attack grew fiercer.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thousand Hands Thousand Eyes began to tear apart.
 </p>
 <p>
  The golden wheel was turning black even faster than before.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka, the enemy the Martial God feared most.
 </p>
 <p>
  And Seong Jihan, who despite his foolish final choice, had created many variables.
 </p>
 <p>
  If Ashoka transferred his power to Seong Jihan,
 </p>
 <p>
  The seemingly ended ‘variables’ would resurface uncontrollably.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No matter what, I must eliminate these two here.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Feeling more urgent than ever,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God decided to employ his final card.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  From the giant eyes of the Martial God in the sky, red light spread.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Oh… what’s that.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Something is appearing near the Martial God’s eyes…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Isn’t that the Dragon King’s head that looked like a snake?Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  – But it’s insanely huge;;;
 </p>
 <p>
  Adorned with engravings of the 17777th son of the Sun King,
 </p>
 <p>
  A massive snake’s head emerged from Tuseong’s sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  Roar!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the snake’s head descended towards Thousand Hands Thousand Eyes,
 </p>
 <p>
  Even the thousand huge golden hands seemed minuscule in comparison.
 </p>
 <p>
  And,
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The golden hands were torn apart by the snake’s head.
 </p>
 <p>
  Below them,
 </p>
 <p>
  Was Ashoka, manipulating the Golden Wheel.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ashoka! The fire hadn’t been lit. You are too late!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing that the sacred flame had not yet been ignited,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God hurried to devour him.
 </p>
 <p>
  The power couldn’t be passed to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  But,
 </p>
 <p>
  [What? Where did Seong Jihan go…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside Thousand Hands Thousand Eyes,
 </p>
 <p>
  There should have been the two of them, but in the Martial God’s view,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka was alone.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Heh. Snake, you’re in such a rush. Isn’t it strange?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [What?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why would I talk so openly for you to hear?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Grin.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka smiled, facing the bewildered serpent.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Having passed the burden to the next generation. I should take 20% more of your power.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You… deceived me…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. You always fell for my tricks.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Golden light erupted from his body, shining in all directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I leave the rest to you, Seong Jihan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Within the snake’s head,
 </p>
 <p>
  Golden light whirled.

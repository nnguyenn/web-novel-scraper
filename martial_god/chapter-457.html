  Chapter 457
 </p>
 <p>
  Just a moment ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the outskirts of Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a place shining with a more dazzling white light than usual,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sun King, in the form of a giant made of light, was blocked by an unexpected obstacle, unable to proceed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Cosmic Demon… step aside and cease hindering me!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I cannot do that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak, who seemed no more than a firefly under the sun in comparison to the Sun King’s size.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet he blocked the giant of light in the vastness of space all by himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Martial God is my son. Do you, his servant, intend to block a father from meeting his son?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s why you haven’t been killed by me yet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [What, what did you say…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you not feel anything from our battle just now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak looked up at the Sun King.
 </p>
 <p>
  In his hand, he held the Taiji Sword, now glowing in pure white light.
 </p>
 <p>
  When he pointed the sword tip at the Sun King,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sun King involuntarily took a step back.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing this, Dongbang Sak stroked his beard and let out a slight smirk.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems you did feel something.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You impudent…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  To be humiliated by the likes of his son’s servant.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sun King was enraged by Dongbang Sak’s mockery, yet he did not drop his guard against that shining sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak’s Taiji Sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  The overwhelming destructive power of that sword had already been experienced once in their clash.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘How can a mere human be so powerful…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Cosmic Demon.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God’s faithful servant, renowned for never having lost a battle in BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whenever the Sun King heard such rumors, he only found them laughable.
 </p>
 <p>
  An undefeated deity?
 </p>
 <p>
  That just meant he hadn’t lived long enough to encounter a true powerful being.
 </p>
 <p>
  When faced with a celestial being like himself, the Cosmic Demon would be crushed easily.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…I cannot defeat him with this body.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Having sensed the location of Tuseong, the Sun King had hastily descended only a part of his main body.
 </p>
 <p>
  He realized he could not surpass Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak turned his body around in the stalemate, facing his back to the Sun King.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sun King’s light exploded.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You dare turn your back on me now in my presence?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  As intense light emanated from the Sun King, Dongbang Sak squinted his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hold on for a moment. This is an important moment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  And then, he swung the Taiji Sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  The motion was a mere slash, a simple move.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet the trail of light spat out endless darkness, consuming the Sun King’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  A strike far stronger than their previous clash.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sun King, once a giant of light, was left with only his head in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  [W-what is this power… did you hold back before?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “He might be your son, that’s why I have not killed you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak spoke outwardly but had different thoughts inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If you die here, the Martial God will summon me to Tuseong. You need to stay.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If he teamed up with Ashoka against the Martial God, Seong Jihan would die no matter what he did.
 </p>
 <p>
  To leave a desperate situation at Tuseong, he couldn’t afford to kill the Sun King now.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having neutralized the Sun King, Dongbang Sak observed the events at Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Ashoka.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing Ashoka appear, Dongbang Sak gripped the Taiji Sword tightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  This meant the time to defy the Martial God had come.
 </p>
 <p>
  Leaving aside the Sun King, Dongbang Sak intended to go to Tuseong to aid him, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dongbang Sak, can you hear me?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Before he could intervene, Ashoka’s voice reached him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can hear you.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [How many of the relics can you destroy in a single strike?]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘In one go? Currently, about 10 to 20 percent with one strike.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [I see… then you must not intervene yet.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Still… not the time to act? Even in this situation?’
 </p>
 <p>
  While Ashoka prevented Dongbang Sak from intervening,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing Seong Jihan break the ignition device, Ashoka’s voice grew lighter.
 </p>
 <p>
  [He has broken the device, showing his resolve. The time has come. I entrust the relics to you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Ashoka! I will aid you. Together we can bring down the Martial God today!’
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Realizing the implications of Ashoka’s words, Dongbang Sak desperately sent his intent,
 </p>
 <p>
  [No, it’s still not possible. Rather, now you must hide even more. Become a loyal servant.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Become a loyal servant.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak watched in stunned silence as Ashoka activated Thousand Hands and Thousand Eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Given the Martial God’s reaction, Ashoka was certain to trigger a forbidden rule.
 </p>
 <p>
  If Dongbang Sak didn’t intervene to help, Ashoka would surely die.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Ashoka, my sword… was it lacking? Very well. I will destroy the celestial weapons. I will use all my power to bring down the heavens of Tuseong. So, I beg…!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Blood dripped from his hand gripping the Taiji Sword, his eyes bloodshot.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do not forget the oath to save the world.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Hearing Ashoka’s words, Dongbang Sak felt his strength leave him.
 </p>
 <p>
  The reason both of them became servants of the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  It had to be prioritized above their lives.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…What should I do?’
 </p>
 <p>
  [First, you must become a loyal servant. And then…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak listened to Ashoka’s last message.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then carefully watched the situation at Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka summoned Thousand Hands and Thousand Eyes, protecting Seong Jihan and breaking the land of Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the end, Ashoka revealed the true form of the Martial God, a colossal serpent’s head.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even as he was swallowed,
 </p>
 <p>
  He self-destructed, inflicting severe damage on the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak watched all of this with vacant eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…If I had been a bit stronger.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If he could destroy the heavens of Tuseong with a single strike, Ashoka wouldn’t have had to die like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s his fault.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak captured every moment of Ashoka’s disappearance in his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Look there! The Martial God… that bastard is indeed my son! The 17777th son! Ah, perhaps you can’t read the letters?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sun King had considerably recovered his body.
 </p>
 <p>
  Drawing more power from his main body, his form grew even larger.
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching Tuseong, he saw the patterns on the serpent’s head and exclaimed in amazement.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Cosmic Demon, step aside immediately. I will gladly lend my strength to my struggling son!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Silence.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak extended the Taiji Sword behind him.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ha, do you think I’ll be overcome as easily as before? I’ve drawn more power from my main body…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Before the Sun King could finish his words, darkness engulfed his form.
 </p>
 <p>
  The darkness that swallowed the sunlight.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Quiet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Dongbang Sak swung the sword again,
 </p>
 <p>
  The darkness spread even faster.
 </p>
 <p>
  [No… I hurriedly drew more power from my main body…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Quiet.”CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
 </p>
 <p>
  Sssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  The darkness consumed the giant head of the Sun King.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had said he didn’t kill him earlier because he was the father of the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now there was no mercy.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This is beyond anything…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Quiet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sun King, who was behind Dongbang Sak, was completely submerged in darkness.
 </p>
 <p>
  His voice ceased.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sun King was utterly defeated and vanished by Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Quiet… be quiet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak continued to extend his sword behind him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Repeating only the words to be quiet.
 </p>
 <p>
  And with his eyes, he watched Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Hmm.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan opened his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just moments ago,
 </p>
 <p>
  -You have the sacred flame. If you take my power, you won’t be as helpless against the Martial God as before.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka said to kill him with the sacred flame.
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, as his vision darkened, he found himself in an unfamiliar space.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Here… doesn’t seem to be Tuseong.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked around.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was ground to stand on, but apart from that, it was a dark and empty place.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm… should I check the chat?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan opened the chat window on BattleTube.
 </p>
 <p>
  Reading the messages should tell him what happened while he lost consciousness.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow, what the… did the Martial God deceive us?
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  -He deliberately said it. To pass his power to Seong Jihan, in a desperate all-out effort;
 </p>
 <p>
  -But with such a fierce attack, how can he survive??
 </p>
 <p>
  -Hey, the Martial God said Seong Jihan is missing… but how are we watching this??
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh. It’s going to explode!
 </p>
 <p>
  -He self-destructed…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow, Ashoka took 40% of the Martial God’s power alone
 </p>
 <p>
  The chat was filled with lengthy messages describing the events after he lost consciousness.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Self-destructed… Ashoka?’
 </p>
 <p>
  What in the world happened?
 </p>
 <p>
  he needed to watch the video again later.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking that, Seong Jihan noticed BattleTube’s chat had stopped.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I don’t remember turning it off… did it shut down automatically?’
 </p>
 <p>
  He considered turning it back on but decided to first determine where he was.
 </p>
 <p>
  Step. Step.
 </p>
 <p>
  How long had he been walking?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I see a light.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A faint golden light piercing through the darkness.
 </p>
 <p>
  Approaching closer,
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Drurr…
 </p>
 <p>
  A small golden wheel slowly turned in the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  A divine aura emanated from the Golden Wheel.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This must be Ashoka’s…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing this, Seong Jihan confirmed that Ashoka had indeed brought him here.
 </p>
 <p>
  Must have sent him here before self-destructing.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He took out 40% of the Martial God’s power alone… I owe him.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Feeling both gratitude and sorrow for Ashoka’s final act,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan gazed at the Golden Wheel.
 </p>
 <p>
  The slowly turning golden wheel spread light on the ground as Seong Jihan arrived.
 </p>
 <p>
  And soon,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoooosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The surroundings began to change.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This place… is Seolleung, where the Tower of Babel was set up.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Tower of Babel that had been set up to abduct Seong Jihan to Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though Pythia and Gilgamesh had failed their goal, he still got dragged by the red hand’s mischief.
 </p>
 <p>
  A place that started all these events.
 </p>
 <p>
  A place resonating with the Tower of Babel’s presence…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Could this be connected to the Tower of Babel in Tuseong?’
 </p>
 <p>
  A place reflecting the surroundings of the Tower of Babel set up on Earth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan guessed it might be linked to the Tower of Babel in Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  While he was looking around,
 </p>
 <p>
  Drurr…
 </p>
 <p>
  The little golden wheel reversed its rotation by one turn.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash…!
 </p>
 <p>
  In this space reflecting Seolleung’s scenery,
 </p>
 <p>
  A portal suddenly emerged.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This… could it be a portal to Seolleung?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hadn’t the little golden wheel rewound time to recreate the moment when Gilgamesh and Pythia invaded?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan examined the portal, which shimmered with both blue and red light.
 </p>
 <p>
  Normally, he wouldn’t just step into any portal.
 </p>
 <p>
  But if this place was linked to the Tower of Babel in Tuseong,
 </p>
 <p>
  He needed to go in before the Martial God, recovering from the self-destruct, could chase him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Fine, I trust Ashoka.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Saved his life and took out 40% of the Martial God’s power.
 </p>
 <p>
  If I don’t trust him, who else could I?
 </p>
 <p>
  As he was about to step into the portal, he paused.
 </p>
 <p>
  He looked at the now motionless golden wheel.
 </p>
 <p>
  That… even though it’s not moving, it still has a significant presence.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Come to think of it. In that critical moment, he did mention the sacred flame…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Was that just a bluff to deceive the Martial God?
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking at the Golden Wheel, he thought it unlikely.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mentioning the sacred flame perhaps meant.
 </p>
 <p>
  To burn the wheel and take its power now.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Alright, let’s use the sacred flame.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan summoned the energy of red.
 </p>
 <p>
  But compared to when he fought the Martial God,
 </p>
 <p>
  Only a ridiculously small amount of fire energy responded.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Is it because all the buffs are gone? It’s gotten really weak.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought he needed to examine his abilities later.
 </p>
 <p>
  He ignited the sacred flame with his fingertip.
 </p>
 <p>
  Drurr…
 </p>
 <p>
  Responding to the fire, the Golden Wheel began to move,
 </p>
 <p>
  Leaping into the white flame.

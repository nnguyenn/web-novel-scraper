  Chapter 458
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  As the golden wheel disappeared within the white flames, Seong Jihan felt his physical senses vanish for an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  And soon after,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The surrounding scenery changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  From the pitch-dark space to a world bathed in sunlight.
 </p>
 <p>
  What Seong Jihan first noticed was a gigantic tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  And beneath it, a man sitting in meditation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He resembles Ashoka.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Though he looked gaunt as if he had suffered a lot.
 </p>
 <p>
  His appearance was strikingly similar to that of the constellation Ashoka.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan surmised that this man must be ‘Siddhartha,’ before he received his title from the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he sat there for a long while,
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, red flames erupted above his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “For us, such a thing…”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a sigh, the closed-eyed Siddhartha gazed at the flames above his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bathed in a subtle golden light, he appeared nothing short of divine.
 </p>
 <p>
  The flames above his head also emanated an intense aura.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Have you realized it? You grasped my existence and escaped.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Shimmer…
 </p>
 <p>
  The flames that floated in the air slowly extinguished, forming an eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I am your creator. You, who are birthed from me, are my mother.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  An eye, claiming to be the creator of humanity and calling humanity its mother.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan understood who it was.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…The Red Administrator.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Through Gilgamesh, it created humans with the seed of red.
 </p>
 <p>
  By propagating them, it ultimately aimed to become a permanent administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seems that the Red Administrator had once appeared before Siddhartha.
 </p>
 <p>
  [A realized one, you have two paths ahead.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  The eye looked down upon Siddhartha.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Will you cooperate with me or turn your back on me?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Cooperation or turning my back…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you cooperate, you will merge with me and enjoy eternal life. If you refuse, you will live as you are and eventually die.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan considered the choices given by the administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Both sound bad, but turning my back seems slightly better.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Cooperating would simply make him a part of the Red Administrator’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  At best, he might be turned into one of the administrator’s eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Turning his back and living out his life seemed a better option.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan pondered,
 </p>
 <p>
  “We will ultimately become part of you, the absolute.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Indeed. That is the reason for your existence.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Will the consciousness of ‘I’ disappear?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The realized are respected. You will retain your consciousness.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “And the unrealized ones…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Even becoming a fragment of the administrator would be an honor for them.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The unrealized ones would just become part of the body.
 </p>
 <p>
  [So, what will you choose?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Between cooperation and turning my back?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Precisely.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The eye’s movement seemed indifferent, as if it didn’t care which choice was made.
 </p>
 <p>
  It considered both choices inconsequential in the grand scheme of things.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll choose a third path.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [A third path?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I will defy you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […]
 </p>
 <p>
  At Siddhartha’s decision, the eye gleamed with interest.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Defiance… it’s akin to turning your back. Because it’s impossible.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Perhaps.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Will you still choose it?]
 </p>
 <p>
  As Siddhartha nodded, the eye flickered.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Five realized beings before you, all chose to turn their backs. But defiance… interesting.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Fine. Amid long waiting, you’ve brought me some entertainment.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The red eye, which seemed to welcome the third path of defiance,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly began to move through the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What?’
 </p>
 <p>
  It headed towards Seong Jihan, who was watching from afar.
 </p>
 <p>
  [What about you?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The eye looked directly at him.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Will you be my heart in this generation?]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What…’
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  Heart, he said?
 </p>
 <p>
  What on earth is this eye talking about?
 </p>
 <p>
  [The heart is the central organ dealing with the administrator’s power of red. It’s the core within me.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “And what does that have to do with me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [In ancient times, the heart’s essence was passed to the most exceptional among humans…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  The red eye looked towards Siddhartha.
 </p>
 <p>
  Was he also a heart’s essence?
 </p>
 <p>
  [However, cases emerged where the essence was discarded upon realization. A side effect of combining it with the most exceptional among humanity.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “So?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Thus, I decided to select the heart at random, rather than the best.]
 </p>
 <p>
  So, Siddhartha was the greatest of his time, selected as the heart’s essence.
 </p>
 <p>
  But because he realized and defied it, they changed the method to a random selection.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, I wasn’t chosen because I was great, just by luck?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s right.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Then the reason I could read your texts and use red powers was because I am the heart?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s not all.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the eye spoke,
 </p>
 <p>
  Thump.
 </p>
 <p>
  A peculiar sensation spread through Seong Jihan’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is…’
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  [The heart’s essence helped you make optimal choices.]
 </p>
 <p>
  This intuition, which had always guided Seong Jihan to make the best possible decisions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks to this, he overcame many crises.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the moment he took out the ignition device of the World Tree, it warned him intensely that pressing the button was the only way to survive.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So, this intuition… because I was the heart?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Now it made sense why the Red Hand kept calling him the main body.
 </p>
 <p>
  [So once again, I ask. What will you do?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Didn’t you see me break the switch?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I saw it. That was because of your ignorance.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ignorance…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It was a choice made from not understanding the administrator’s power.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Tap!
 </p>
 <p>
  The red eye attached itself to Seong Jihan’s forehead.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  The scenery changed once again.
 </p>
 <p>
  This time to the moment when Seong Jihan was first summoned to Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Look.]
 </p>
 <p>
  And again, a combat simulation unfolded.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God, merged with Tuseong, fiercely pressured Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  But this time, Seong Jihan took out the switch from his inventory and pressed it immediately.
 </p>
 <p>
  Click.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s entire body caught fire, then quickly began to expand infinitely.
 </p>
 <p>
  His entire being, along with his senses, filled with a tremendous sense of satisfaction.
 </p>
 <p>
  [To be reborn as an administrator…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The shocked voice of the Martial God, merged with Tuseong, echoed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the newly born Red Administrator, Seong Jihan stomped once on Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  A crater formed on the planet.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a wave of his hand, the relics burst into flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even the Martial God, who had accumulated power through infinite regressions, couldn’t dare stand against the overwhelming power of the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom! Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  Ultimately, Tuseong shattered, and the Martial God vanished without a trace.
 </p>
 <p>
  [See.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the administrator, Seong Jihan leaped once,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  In an instant, he arrived on Earth.
 </p>
 <p>
  After pressing the button, the world had been completely incinerated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not just humanity, but even Seoul was reduced to ashes.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Destroyed worlds can be restored.]
 </p>
 <p>
  With a flick of his finger,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  The scenery of Seoul rewound, restored perfectly.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Those who vanished can be revived.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Click.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he snapped his fingers, people began to revive from the restored Seoul.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Uncle?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jihan… Jih-?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Among them were Seong Jihan’s family, looking up at him from the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Even blessings can be bestowed upon cherished ones.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the administrator’s power manifested, a red glow enveloped Yoon Seah and Seong Jiah.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Their bodies transformed, becoming part of the red lineage.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Wow, Uncle! I’m gigantic!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [This… is amazing…]
 </p>
 <p>
  The two women, now with bodies of giants imbued with red eyes,
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})

 <p>
  Were excitedly observing their enlarged forms.
 </p>
 <p>
  But,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Is that what he calls a blessing?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing his sister and niece transformed into creatures of the red lineage, Seong Jihan felt cold.
 </p>
 <p>
  Making them into giant monsters filled with eyes…
 </p>
 <p>
  That would surely haunt his dreams.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile,
 </p>
 <p>
  Buzz…
 </p>
 <p>
  After restoring the world,
 </p>
 <p>
  [How do you feel about the administrator’s power?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The red eye detached from Seong Jihan’s forehead, asking him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s certainly strong. I think I’ve underestimated the stat of red.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Though the experience of becoming the Red Administrator was brief, it left a strong impression on Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially the way that form handled the red abilities; it was on a whole different level from what he could currently achieve.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he could emulate even a fraction of it, he could greatly enhance his current proficiency with the red stat.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he responded,
 </p>
 <p>
  [In that case.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Buzz…
 </p>
 <p>
  A red light shot out from the eye,
 </p>
 <p>
  Forming something on Seong Jihan’s right arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is… the World Tree ignition device?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Indeed. Go to Earth and press it. What you saw will become reality.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan scrutinized the switch.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ignition device he had received before had a purple plate with a red button.
 </p>
 <p>
  This one had a red plate, differing only in that there was no void.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  “This design is exactly the same as the last one, too similar.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The button given by the owner of the arena,
 </p>
 <p>
  And the one crafted by the Red Administrator looked indistinguishably alike.
 </p>
 <p>
  Only the plate color differed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you and the arena owner collaborating?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [No, I simply referenced your switch.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Had we received help from the void, there would be no need for such troublesome methods.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The administrator’s calm answer made Seong Jihan feel uneasy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Did it have to replicate the switch so precisely?
 </p>
 <p>
  Also, though the administrator claimed no cooperation with the void…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The owner of the arena did give me the ignition device.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He might have some leverage to test out.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan pondered,
 </p>
 <p>
  [So what is your answer?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator demanded a reply.
 </p>
 <p>
  “My answer?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Spark!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan clenched his fist, shattering the World Tree ignition device instantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I need to see my niece get married. No one would take her like that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Giant eye-covered Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  Certainly one of the most horrific sights he’d ever seen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They were just replicas.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The people revived in such a manner were clearly different entities from before.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though it appeared as though time had reversed when the power was manifested,
 </p>
 <p>
  Those who disappeared from the button press weren’t truly brought back.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just similar entities were recreated.
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s firm decision,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Despite experiencing the power… this heart is foolish.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The eye replied with a tone of resignation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, thanks to you, I have a much better grasp of the red abilities. Their feeling is remarkable.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You won’t have the opportunity to use them.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [My hand will crush you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hand?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It will burst the foolish heart and attach to the new one.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned at that statement.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Hand,
 </p>
 <p>
  It regenerated from his body even after being severed by the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was like having a poison mushroom growing inside him.
 </p>
 <p>
  His right hand moving on its own would be quite a hassle.
 </p>
 <p>
  But,
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is this new heart?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It would be someone very close to you, with talent.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Close to me…”
 </p>
 <p>
  There weren’t many people who fit that description.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Come to think of it, the hand kept observing Seahh.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Could it be that Yoon Seah would become the new heart?
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan’s expression hardened,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  From beneath the Bodhi tree, Siddhartha rose.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I will sever the connection.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You will…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s the power I left behind for this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He smiled as he spoke.

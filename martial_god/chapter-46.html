  Chapter 46
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  August 21st.
 </p>
 <p>
  As usual, Seong Jihan drove Yoon Seah to school.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, they left earlier today, at 6 in the morning. Tomorrow was Yoon Seah’s 18th birthday.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, you’ll be in the Gift Hall until midnight today?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes! Of course. I need to get a good Gift, after all.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll come pick you up then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay, uncle.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After Yoon Seah declined Kim Heesu’s offer, she stopped riding with her on the way home. While Kim Heesu said it was okay, Yoon Seah was reluctant because she felt as if she was accumulating a debt.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But it’ll be late… Is that okay?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m curious about your Gift, so I’ll definitely come.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Heh, you told me not to expect too much, but you seem curious too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why wouldn’t I be? I just told you not to have too high expectations to avoid disappointment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Yeah, I think I understand what you mean.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah remained silent for a moment, her expression contemplative.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought, ‘Her expectations seem to have diminished compared to before…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Until recently, Yoon Seah seemed confident she would receive a good Gift.
 </p>
 <p>
  After all, no one had parents with an SSS-rank and an SS-rank Gift.
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering the total rank of her parents’ Gifts, she would be the world’s top ranker.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if there’s randomness in the Gifts, not having any expectations seemed strange.
 </p>
 <p>
  But recently, due to Seong Jihan’s continuous conversations and indirect brainwashing, her expectations seemed to have waned.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead, she now had a deep yearning.
 </p>
 <p>
  Expectation and yearning.
 </p>
 <p>
  They seemed similar but were distinctly different. While Yoon Seah’s expectation was “Of course, I’ll receive a good Gift!”, her yearning was a deep-seated desire of “I must get a good Gift!”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…The situation has changed a lot from my previous life.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks to Seong Jihan’s efforts, compared to his previous life, things were better now.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the past, she was seen more as the biggest victim rather than the daughter of a traitor.
 </p>
 <p>
  But just because it’s better now doesn’t mean it’s a good situation for Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  After all, she was still abandoned by her father.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if expectations waned, the yearning was something Seong Jihan couldn’t control.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ve seen that even a F-rank Gift can be useful, right? So, you can receive anything.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Trying to lighten the mood, Seong Jihan spoke, and Yoon Seah slightly brightened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really? You haven’t even shown me the rest of your status window.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you really that curious? Since it’s the day before your birthday, should I show it now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No… not now. Today, I just want to focus on the Gift Hall.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay. I’ll show you after it’s over.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When they arrived at the BattleNet Academy’s underground parking lot, Yoon Seah got out of the car with a smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thanks, uncle. I’ll go now!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Her expression was as cheerful as always.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the other hand, Seong Jihan couldn’t help but sigh secretly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once the results are out tonight, it’ll be hard to see that smiling face.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should come early.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Jihan began driving away while thinking that he should be there sooner to clear up any unnecessary disturbances.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the Gift Hall, red gemstones, known as Gift Gems, were embedded all over the walls. Yoon Seah was guided to a private room, a privilege given only to students on the day before their birthday.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Yoon Seah entered the room, the Gift Gems around her blinked, signalling that the blessing of the Gift Gems was activated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sitting silently, Yoon Seah recalled yesterday’s events…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you still pretending to be friends with her?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Voices echoed from the restroom belonging to someone familiar to Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the voice of her friend whom she had known since her first year of the academy.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m pretending just to get that interview. It’s all a ruse.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you a journalist? Lol. But Yoon Seah is still acting high and mighty.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Exactly. She’s clueless… She should be grateful for the interview offer.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It was Kim Heesu, her best friend and classmate, talking behind her back.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seriously, she thinks too highly of herself. She has nothing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, What if she gets an SSS-grade Gift?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, I’ll become friends again. That’s why I haven’t completely cut her off.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You really hate her, don’t you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I never liked her from the start. She’s from a baseless family. If not for BattleNet, would we even breathe the same air as her?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah was stunned by the malicious words from someone she believed was her closest friend.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…I had suspicions.’
 </p>
 <p>
  There had been signs.
 </p>
 <p>
  After her return to school, her friends’ behaviour changed. They became distant and standoffish.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the time, she thought it was out of consideration, given what had happened to her.
 </p>
 <p>
  But after the Korea-Japan showdown, when the Sword King destroyed the Korean team, their attitudes became more evident, especially after it was confirmed that the Sword King wouldn’t return to Korea.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gradually, Yoon Seah was looked down upon by her peers. Kim Heesu’s behaviour was a prime example.
 </p>
 <p>
  She persisted with the interview request, a behaviour she wouldn’t dare display when the Sword King was around.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…I declined the interview, but…’
 </p>
 <p>
  She knew she would face reporters from Kim Heesu’s media company once she left the Gift Hall after midnight.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite her refusal, Kim Heesu’s intentions remained unaltered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Gifts are random…” Yoon Seah whispered, recalling the words Seong Jihan frequently mentioned.
 </p>
 <p>
  She understood why he kept emphasising it.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was concerned about her, knowing that the higher the expectations, the greater the disappointment.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But I… need a good Gift.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t because she wanted the friends who spoke ill of her to approach her again.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t because she feared ridicule from others if she didn’t receive a Gift.
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to the pain of being abandoned by the father she admired, these things meant nothing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah believed she had lived diligently in her place.
 </p>
 <p>
  She served as the Student Council President, maintained top grades, and fostered good relationships with her peers.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, after her father, the Sword King, betrayed the country, all her efforts felt in vain.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her life was entangled with the Sword King’s actions.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I want to stand on my own.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If living a decent life was the goal, she had more than enough resources.
 </p>
 <p>
  The money she received from the Sword King was immense.
 </p>
 <p>
  But she wanted to live her live with freedom. Freedom from the label of ‘Sword King’s daughter and victim’.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘To do that…’
 </p>
 <p>
  She needed power.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yes, like her uncle, she wanted to showcase dominant skills in the league.
 </p>
 <p>
  She wanted to live as ‘BattleNet’s rising star’, not as ‘The Sword King’s abandoned daughter’.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘To do that, I need a good Gift…!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah yearned deeply.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I want to be like my uncle!’
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash! Flash!
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  The Gift Gems began to shine brighter.
 </p>
 <p>
  This change was different from the usual blessings.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is…!’
 </p>
 <p>
  She recalled stories from her senior students at the academy. The brighter the light emitted from the Gift Gem, the higher the probability of receiving a good Gift.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t recall any senior getting such a bright glow, even when they received an S-grade.”
 </p>
 <p>
  According to a senior’s experience, about half of the Gift Gems in the room shone brightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  But right now, almost all the Gift Gems were flashing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Can I hope for something good?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah felt a surge of expectation she had been suppressing.
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  In a coffee shop in Gangnam. Kim Heesu, meeting her cousin after a long time, checked the time.
 </p>
 <p>
  9 PM.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was time to get prepared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Bro, wait a sec~ I need to make a call.”

 <p>
  “Go ahead.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Heesu immediately picked up her phone.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Reporter Kim? It’s me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes, miss.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is everything ready for Seah’s interview?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [For Miss. Yoon’s interview? We are prepared, but… are you sure? We don’t even know what her gift is.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, we’re best friends. She gave me permission.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite Yoon Seah’s repeated refusals, Kim Heesu confidently said so.
 </p>
 <p>
  [But outsiders are forbidden to enter at this hour, right?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course, you’ll go with me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Alright. Where should we go?]
 </p>
 <p>
  After Kim Heesu mentioned the name of the cafe, Reporter Kim added,
 </p>
 <p>
  [I’m worried Mr. Seong might interfere again.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan? Why would he?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Last time during the Independence Day interview at Sword Palace, he restrained our reporters. I don’t know what power he used, but they couldn’t move at all.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Anyway, I’ll head there, miss.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay, Reporter Kim.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After ending the call, Kim Insik, Kim Heesu’s cousin, looked intrigued.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
 </p>
 <p>
  “An interview at this hour?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you know Yoon Seah?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yoon Seah? Oh, the Sword King’s daughter? I asked you to set us up on a date, but you said she was out of my league.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, her.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the change in Kim Heesu’s attitude, Kim Insik became interested.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Does she have a boyfriend?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “She probably never dated in her life.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really? With that face?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “She’s always had high standards. Maybe she never found anyone worthy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How about me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Heesu chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like he’d become interested in her after seeing the photos she shared on her social media with her friends.
 </p>
 <p>
  “During the time when she was known as the Sword King’s daughter, she was out of your league. But now? You’re too good for her. You’ve been doing well lately.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Insik, who received an A-grade Gift and grew rapidly, was now level 50 and preparing for his Silver promotion match.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, looks are everything in a relationship.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t end up falling for her. She’s practically an orphan now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “She has her uncle, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s why I said ‘practically’.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You better not talk like that about my future girlfriend.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you talking about? Do you like her that much?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, She’s pretty.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Ah, so for guys, beauty is everything?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Heesu casually added,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you want to come for the interview too?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Just in case Seong Jihan tries to mess up the interview, you can step in.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At that, Kim Insik narrowed his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So that’s why you called me out of the blue, isn’t it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, I only heard about Seong Jihan now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm. Suspicious…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re not scared of a Bronze league player, are you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh…Are you crazy? Why would I be scared of a Bronze player? Let me see her picture again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon seeing the photo,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow… she’s really… so pretty. I’ll go with you on one condition: give me her number.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Number? Okay, I’ll give it to you after the interview.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Great, great. I need to fix my hair then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Insik quickly left, and watching him, Kim Heesu smirked.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s settled.’
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how strong Seong Jihan might be, he can’t beat a level 50 warrior.

  Chapter 460
 </p>
 <p>
  “Dongbang Sak has always been strong, that much we know,”
 </p>
 <p>
  Everyone knew the strength of Dongbang Sak, but he wasn’t so weak that Seong Jihan couldn’t draw out the Taiji Sword from him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I keep mimicking his martial arts using the Martial Soul, Dongbang Sak might just get angry enough to unsheathe the Taiji Sword.’
 </p>
 <p>
  However, it wasn’t like Ashoka wouldn’t know this. There had to be a reason behind his words.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is there a particular reason you’re worrying about him now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dongbang Sak is an extraordinary being in the realm of martial arts. To control him, the Martial God has been suppressing Dongbang Sak’s growth.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…That is considering him suppressed?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Even with maximum suppression, he is this powerful.]
 </p>
 <p>
  No wonder the Martial God had been wary of him.
 </p>
 <p>
  [However, he has appeared as a new variable.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You mean the Sun King?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. Within countless regressions, the relationship between the Sun King and the Martial God was never revealed. If it weren’t for you, it might never have been discovered.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The infinite regressions of the Martial God seemed to reset from the time humanity entered BattleNet to their fall and extinction.
 </p>
 <p>
  This period, even considering the Martial God possessing the Dragon Lord’s head and the Sun King being his father, was not long enough for these facts to be uncovered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Sun King seemed eager to interact with the Martial God. The symbols on the snake’s face, were those restrictions?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Likely. The Martial God has been avoiding the Sun King, but now he cannot. With Tuseong’s location exposed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “So then…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [He has one option left, to use Dongbang Sak to eliminate the Sun King.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “So the Martial God is lifting Dongbang Sak’s growth limit to ensure the Sun King’s defeat?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Precisely.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The emergence of the Sun King as a variable necessitated the removal of Dongbang Sak’s limit. Seong Jihan licked his lips in thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  When the Martial God dragged him to Tuseong, he had no choice but to pull out the Solar Core.
 </p>
 <p>
  Things have come full circle, coincidentally strengthening Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But how much time does he really have to grow?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan asked, skeptical.
 </p>
 <p>
  [His single day is worth a hundred years of a regular warrior.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…That’s quite an unfair world we live in.”
 </p>
 <p>
  To possess such talent that even such statements aren’t an exaggeration.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, since it was true, Seong Jihan decided to heed Ashoka’s warning.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it. We need to proceed as swiftly as possible.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes, take that into account.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anything else you want to guide me on?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’ve led things up to this point commendably. You will handle the rest well, without my guidance.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Was Ashoka implying he should handle things independently now?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, he’s already guided me this far.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Having shattered 40% of the Martial God’s power, bestowing the Azure stat and dealing with the troublesome administrator’s hand himself,
 </p>
 <p>
  Expecting any more help would indeed be greedy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright. I’ll take care of the rest. I’ve owed you a lot.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You are dependable. Then… I shall rest. Come at your own pace.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  With these words, the golden shimmer began to fade.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan watched it silently.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rumble…
 </p>
 <p>
  The ground shook once more, prompting him to turn his gaze back.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Seems I can’t stay here any longer.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The portal to Earth was now about to close.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was time to truly leave.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Still.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Before moving,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan bowed deeply towards the dissipating light.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you so much, Ashoka. I am deeply indebted to you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [To hear you speak so formally now that I’m about to die.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Perhaps I should have done this sooner.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I feel more guilty. I’ve burdened you with too much.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well… this was my duty anyway.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Just one last thing before you go.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded, and the shimmer gleamed one last time.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Survive until the end. Use the Golden Wheel for your survival. Absolutely.]

 <p>
  “Understood, I certainly will.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Then go now. There’s truly no time left.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan bowed once more, then turned towards the portal.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  As he entered, the light flickered and the portal vanished.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Now. I can finally rest…]
 </p>
 <p>
  And with the portal’s closure,
 </p>
 <p>
  The golden light slowly faded away.
 </p>

 </p>
 <p>
  The scorched Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God had reverted to his usual form, surveying his star.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Half of what I painstakingly built through countless regressions is gone.’
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan was brought to Tuseong, he had thought he would soon become a permanent administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  How did things end up like this?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Seong Jihan’s defiance was unexpected but manageable.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even after using a supernova as a last resort, Seong Jihan was far stronger than anticipated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fighting him demanded even the fusion with Tuseong, resulting in a strenuous battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Once I merged with Tuseong, everything seemed to smooth out.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the administrator’s hand rebelling and passing the switch to Seong Jihan,
 </p>
 <p>
  The foolish man did not press the button.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment, he thought the battle was already won.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Ashoka.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God’s eyes glowed darkly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite receiving him as a subordinate, he always felt uneasy about Ashoka.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now he recognized it as his crucial error.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the final moments, he underestimated Ashoka’s potential for betrayal.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘In my excitement, I exhausted my strength foolishly, leading to my own destruction.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Unleashing all his power and getting detonated by Ashoka led to devastating outcomes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The entire universe observed my defeat, and the golden tower is shattered. The infinite regressions are now impossible.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The ability to amass power risk-free through infinite regressions was terminated.
 </p>
 <p>
  The position of permanent administrator, which seemed within reach, was now far-off.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God felt a profound sense of emptiness over the changes that occurred within just one day.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…What should I do next?’
 </p>
 <p>
  As he contemplated his future course,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak appeared before him, kneeling.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master, I have repelled the Sun King.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Sun King…]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God’s eyes flickered upon hearing the name.
 </p>
 <p>
  That wretched Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Had he not pulled out the Solar Core, none of this would have happened.
 </p>
 <p>
  Revealing a hint of killing intent, the Martial God asked Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Was he strong?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “He was not overly strong. However, the entity I faced did not seem to be his full form.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hmm.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God nodded in understanding.
 </p>
 <p>
  The destruction of the Solar Core and the Sun King’s arrival had occurred too swiftly. In such a brief time, he couldn’t have brought his full power.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though Dongbang Sak fended him off this time,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If the Sun King returns with his full power, defeat won’t be so easy.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Were it an ordinary great constellation, the Martial God could join forces with Dongbang Sak to swiftly eliminate him.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the Sun King was unlike any other.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God, covered with inscriptions marking him as the 17777th son, could not fight him head-on.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among Tuseong’s warriors, only Dongbang Sak could face the Sun King.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, one concern remained.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Should I spare him?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak, once Ashoka’s comrade, appeared loyal now.
 </p>
 <p>
  But given any trigger, he might easily turn his blade.

 <p>
  Ashoka’s recent betrayal was a significant blow to the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  Another such betrayal, and recovery might be impossible.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eliminating such a risky factor now seemed prudent, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Sun King is the problem.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sun King, having ascertained Tuseong’s location thanks to Seong Jihan, was the issue.
 </p>
 <p>
  Only Dongbang Sak could realistically face him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ordering Dongbang Sak’s suicide now might result in the Sun King’s uncontested takeover later, leading to the loss of his body.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Though our power difference is substantial, he might not take over that easily.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God recalled turning into a serpent head and trying to devour Ashoka.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite concentrating all of Tuseong’s power,
 </p>
 <p>
  The markings of the 17777th son still covered their body.
 </p>
 <p>
  As long as the Sun King’s brand remained, lowering his guard was impossible.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I have no choice.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God gazed coldly at Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  He would wield the sword that is Dongbang Sak until the Sun King is removed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Sun King’s main body will come to Tuseong. Eliminate him with all your might.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood, my master. However,”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Dongbang Sak respectfully bowed,
 </p>
 <p>
  He raised his head to make a request.
 </p>
 <p>
  “At my current strength, challenging the Sun King’s main body may prove difficult. May I train further?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Train?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, specifically, I wish to hone the Taiji Sword.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God regarded Dongbang Sak with calm eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even against a fully empowered great constellation like the Sun King,
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak seemed well-equipped to handle it.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I am confident in defeating him, but I doubt I can overwhelm his main body at present.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […….]
 </p>
 <p>
  “If his light touches Tuseong, the results could be catastrophic…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Though Dongbang Sak could win, it would be perilous,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God pondered briefly on the potential risks.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s better to thoroughly eliminate variables like the Sun King.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to the unpredictability of Dongbang Sak’s potential treason,
 </p>
 <p>
  The threat of the Sun King, capable of usurping his body, was far greater.
 </p>
 <p>
  […I permit it. But train the Taiji Sword outside of Tuseong.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Given its immense destructive capacity, it posed a threat if honed within Tuseong. Training outside was a safer alternative.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, understood!”Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  As Dongbang Sak rejoiced at the Martial God’s command,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ting.
 </p>
 <p>
  A message appeared before him.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have violated punishment directives.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Additional penalties apply.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tuseong is sealed for three months, and its members are under probation for a year.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite breaking system rules, the imposed penalties were minor: a three-month seal and a year of probation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The seal is beneficial.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Before the Sun King’s main body arrives,
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak must be fully prepared.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  [During the seal period, delay the Taiji Sword training.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  During the seal, he had to remain in Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God instructed and thought to himself,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘How many of my disciples remain?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The five disciples of the Martial God had significantly dwindled after this chaos.
 </p>
 <p>
  While contemplating,
 </p>
 <p>
  Driiing…
 </p>
 <p>
  The list of names under probation revealed not only himself and Dongbang Sak,
 </p>
 <p>
  But also Gilgamesh and Pythia.
 </p>
 <p>
  Which meant,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Those two are still alive.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He hadn’t expected Pythia to survive, let alone Gilgamesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I was certain she was completely destroyed.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God’s eyes glinted menacingly.
 </p>
 <p>
  He still had cards to play on Earth.

  Chapter 461
 </p>
 <p>
  Gangnam, Seolleung.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mr. Seong Jihan!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re back!!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who had been kidnapped, crossed over through the portal to his original location.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was being welcomed by the BattleNet Association staff dispatched here.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, well. I survived somehow.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We were on the edge of our seats watching the broadcast…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Martial God, I can’t believe such monsters exist…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If only the Tower of Babel hadn’t disappeared, we could have watched from the office!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan listened to the staff’s stories, he looked around at the mention of the Tower of Babel’s disappearance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed, the Tower of Babel, which had been in a translucent state before he left,
 </p>
 <p>
  was now gone without a trace.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where did the Tower of Babel go?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “After you disappeared, its form gradually faded and vanished.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recalled what happened before he was dragged away.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Pythia stabbed herself with the Ice Sword Rain. At that time, my entire hand was frozen and completely burned away…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The self-harm Pythia had inflicted to freeze Seong Jihan’s arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the time, he had wondered why she did that, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  Only after the Administrator’s Hand awakened and pushed him into Tuseong, did he realize Pythia had foreseen all of this future with her Divine Eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  And at that moment, clearly,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Not only was my hand released. Pythia was also engulfed in flames.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The frozen Pythia had burned away without a trace when thawing his frozen hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  So for now, it could be assumed that she was dead.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Then did Gilgamesh, combined with the Tower of Babel, escape on his own?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh, who had been moving according to Pythia’s words,
 </p>
 <p>
  With no one controlling him, seemed to have withdrawn from the Tower of Babel and fled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It appears Gilgamesh has run away… Have there been any reports of his whereabouts being discovered?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No. We haven’t received any information related to this yet…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even in that state, as expected of a high-ranking constellation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan furrowed his brow.
 </p>
 <p>
  Should he go searching for him as soon as he returns?
 </p>
 <p>
  “How long has it been since the Tower of Babel disappeared?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Today is the third day.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Three days? Was I there for three whole days?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm, let me take a look around.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan expanded his senses.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks to his greatly enhanced abilities from Tuseong, the Martial Soul Domain now covered a much wider range than before, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even as he roamed around Seoul and searched, no presence on Gilgamesh’s level was detected.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s been three days, so I’m too late after all.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if Gilgamesh had weakened, he was a Level 8 Constellation,
 </p>
 <p>
  Given three days of leeway, he could flee to the other side of the Earth.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Still, I need to find him.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka had definitely said,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Although I’ve certainly destroyed the Tower of Babel, there’s always a possibility of the Martial God rebuilding it.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Tower of Babel is a means to store power in the process of infinite regression, and it becomes a pathway for the Martial God to definitively rule Tuseong. You must strive to prevent the Tower of Babel from being rebuilt.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Secure the original owner of the Tower of Babel.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Regarding the Tower of Babel, Ashoka had said they needed to catch Gilgamesh first.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan pondered if there was a good search method, then suddenly,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Ah… I should ask my sister.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He recalled the Divine Eye possessed by Seong Jiah.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the disappearance of the owner of the Abyss, her authority had weakened, but
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, within the Earth’s realm, there seemed to be a possibility of finding a person.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should go home for now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan stopped his search for Gilgamesh for the time being and returned home.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  On the coast of Incheon, overlooking the West Sea.
 </p>
 <p>
  There, an old man was hunched over, gazing at the sea, wearing sunglasses.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although it was chilly as it was autumn, it wasn’t that cold, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  He was standing in a suspicious attire that anyone would find odd, wearing a thick padded jacket with a hat pulled down.
 </p>
 <p>
  And,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can you speak now? Pythia.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the old man spoke,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  Something popped out from inside his padded jacket pocket.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sparkling eyes of light.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the Divine Eye that Pythia possessed.

 <p>
  [Gilgamesh… Why did you save me?]
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan thawed his frozen arm, simultaneously incinerating Pythia,
 </p>
 <p>
  Her body had vanished, unable to withstand the power of the red, but the Divine Eye had faintly remained until the end.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, it couldn’t endure for long either.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh, who had been combined with the Tower of Babel, took the opportunity while Seong Jihan was being dragged away,
 </p>
 <p>
  To steal Pythia’s Divine Eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you had left it, I would have died. Why did you even share your life force… What’s your goal?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I saved you because you’re my first wife.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Gilgamesh’s words, the light in the Divine Eye flickered intensely.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Bullshit. I know well you’re not the type to do that. If you were really going to save me, you wouldn’t have left just the eyes like this.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmph, can’t even take a joke.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh smirked and pointed his finger at the sea.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Pythia. Use your Divine Eye to search for the World Tree.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The World Tree…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Then I’ll supply more life force and regenerate your body.”
 </p>
 <p>
  So there was a separate purpose after all.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia’s Divine Eye flickered.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Why, do you want to turn your old body young again?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course! How can I live like this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ha. You think absorbing the World Tree will restore your youth? Your youth will only return if the Martial God grants you immortality. So stop this nonsense and restore my body. I need to contact the Martial God.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh heard those words and scoffed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmph. That snake bastard won’t have the mind for that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [What?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Tuseong is in chaos.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Chaos? What do you mean?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ashoka betrayed him.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [What?! Be- Betrayal…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even your great Divine Eye couldn’t see that, huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh sneered at the eyes of light.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Divine Eye flickered.
 </p>
 <p>
  […I can’t believe it. How do you even know that in the first place?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “How could I not know when that Seong Jihan guy was broadcasting it so loudly on BattleTube? I watched it well even while escaping.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Show me that video too.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll show you if you promise to cooperate with me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […Fine. I’ll cooperate.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Pythia replied,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whirring.
 </p>
 <p>
  A screen popped up in front of her eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  It hadn’t been long since the video was released, but
 </p>
 <p>
  It was already the most viewed and talked-about video among all the BattleTube videos from the entire universe this year.
 </p>
 <p>
  It started playing in front of Pythia’s Divine Eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Skip the fighting part quickly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh changed the playback speed to 2x.
 </p>
 <p>
  The battle in the video proceeded in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  At first, it seemed like Seong Jihan was holding up well, but the moment the Martial God combined with Tuseong and he was about to meet his end,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Administrator’s Hand began to fully exert its power, and the scene where Seong Jihan took out the World Tree ignition device was shown.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the decisive moment of choosing whether to press it or not,
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh, who was next to her, remarked,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan, that stupid bastard.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Don’t spoil it.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You stupid bastard. He broke the switch.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [What?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Giving up on the Red Administrator. Tsk… I was going to acknowledge him as my son, but I guess it won’t work.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan in the video broke the switch.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh clicked his tongue disapprovingly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “One who aims to reach the pinnacle must not be bound by petty mercy. How foolish to break the switch just worrying about family. I should have had that in my hands instead.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [So you could just watch your children die like before.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why are you bringing that up?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh glared at the Divine Eye with a displeased look.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you keep talking nonsense, I’ll cut off your life force.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Go ahead.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wh-What…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [If I’m gone, can you find the World Tree?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Th-That’s…”
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  [If you could find it, you wouldn’t have wasted precious life force to keep me alive in the first place. I’m just an eye now anyway, so it doesn’t matter if I die.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “A-Ahem…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh, who tried to threaten Pythia with her life only to gain nothing, awkwardly cleared his throat.
 </p>
 <p>
  [So while I’m watching this, stay quiet. If you say one more word, I might just die on purpose.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “E-Even if your life…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Not everyone is like you. I warned you. Don’t open your mouth again.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Eek…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia began to dim her light, refusing life force from her side.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing her actually trying to die, not just pretending, Gilgamesh raised both hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, I got it. I won’t say anything! I’ll stay quiet!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You should have done that from the start. Put the playback speed back to 1x too. I don’t like it fast.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Didn’t you say you wouldn’t talk?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Divine Eye’s light dimmed again as if she would die.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Ah damn, this crazy bitch is serious.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh changed the BattleTube playback settings as she instructed, suppressing his urge to talk back.
 </p>
 <p>
  After finishing watching the chaos that occurred in Tuseong in the form of a Divine Eye,
 </p>
 <p>
  […]
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia stayed silent for a long time, only blinking her light.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This bitch isn’t saying anything after watching it all.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He wanted to urge her to cooperate now that she had finished watching, but
 </p>
 <p>
  Afraid she might actually commit suicide if he said another word, Gilgamesh anxiously watched her.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Player Seong Jihan is starting a live broadcast on BattleTube.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, a message popped up on the BattleTube window that was left open, indicating Seong Jihan had started a broadcast.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hurry and click that.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I told you not to talk.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’m really going to kill you once we find the World Tree.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh gnashed his teeth and clicked on the live broadcast.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hello, everyone.]
 </p>
 <p>
  On the screen, Seong Jihan was greeting the viewers with a nonchalant face.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh Seong Jihan is here omg
 </p>
 <p>
  -Looks like he’s at home based on the background??
 </p>
 <p>
  -When the association staff’s Seong Jihan sighting posts went up on SNS earlier I was doubtful but I’m relieved now
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh, Yoon Seah briefly appeared behind him then disappeared lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -She seems to be crying a lot. Her face is all swollen.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ah but Seong Jihan’s face… The cracks seem to have gotten bigger than before?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh it really has; The gold(cracks) got so much bigger.
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as Seong Jihan’s live broadcast started, the viewers who flooded in were able to quickly notice the changes in him.
 </p>
 <p>
  The cracks on the left side of his face containing the void.
 </p>
 <p>
  That gap, which was initially only finely engraved along his jawline, had now greatly expanded across his cheek after returning from Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Looks like it would shatter if you lightly hit it.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Well he suffered so much there, it can’t be unscathed;
 </p>
 <p>
  -I lost count after a thousand times of him dying…
 </p>
 <p>
  While the viewers sympathized over the changes in his face,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, my face is this cracked now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the viewers’ reactions and only then examined his own face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, it won’t break easily like you’re worrying though.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He tapped it with his finger.
 </p>
 <p>
  Contrary to people’s concerns, his left face was sturdy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although it looked very cracked on the outside, it was still solid.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s stop talking about my face now. The reason I turned on the broadcast today is…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan pulled up his status window and revealed only the level portion to the viewers.
 </p>
 <p>
  “My level has reached a whopping 650.”
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh when did it go up again lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -But shouldn’t the level have gone up more after suffering so much in Tuseong??
 </p>
 <p>
  -Well, come to think of it, he didn’t really defeat many enemies.
 </p>
 <p>
  -That’s true. Then why did the level go up?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Show us the stats below too!
 </p>
 <p>
  -For real I’m curious about Seong Jihan’s current stats lol
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers clamored for him to also reveal his status window at the disclosure of Seong Jihan’s level, but
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah. Can’t do that. I have to do the tournament.”
 </p>
 <p>
  -Tournament…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ah, is that… the one wagering your hand?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Constellations, you’ve waited a long time, right? Now you can participate too!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan tapped his level and grinned, but
 </p>
 <p>
  -…Excuse me.
 </p>
 <p>
  -After seeing you fight the Martial God like that, who’s going to apply for the tournament;
 </p>
 <p>
  -The constellations who already applied before all canceled too.
 </p>
 <p>
  -So who’s going to fight him…
 </p>
 <p>
  The reactions of the alien viewers participating in the live broadcast were very lukewarm.

  Chapter 463
 </p>
 <p>
  The Azure stat.
 </p>
 <p>
  This ability he received from Ashoka only had the function of eliminating Red.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Although it’s only FFF-grade, its ability to deal with red was outstanding.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even when the Administrator’s Hand sealed the Red stat,
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as Seong Jihan raised Azure to 1, that seal was released.
 </p>
 <p>
  Afterward, in order to devour the Red that had been reduced to 100,
 </p>
 <p>
  The energy of Azure, which was only 1, tried to go to where Red had gathered.
 </p>
 <p>
  In terms of total power, this was no different from hitting a rock with an egg, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I was keeping the two energies as far apart as possible in case the stats decreased…’
 </p>
 <p>
  He concentrated Red in his right arm,
 </p>
 <p>
  And only after gathering Azure in his left leg and keeping them far apart did the two not collide.
 </p>
 <p>
  After arranging the energies like this, he didn’t feel any unusual movements from Azure, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Arena Owner appeared before him, Azure, which had been moved to his left leg, began to stir.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Proceeding with the tournament is impossible.”
 </p>
 <p>
  And inside the head of the universe figure calmly opening his mouth,
 </p>
 <p>
  About 30 percent of the stars in the brightly shining white background began to turn red.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…What the hell is that?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The red stars visible after Azure moved.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although he couldn’t feel the energy of Red from there,
 </p>
 <p>
  Squirm…
 </p>
 <p>
  The power of Azure was definitely reacting to it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Arena Owner is one of the highest-ranking existence of the void. For him to have the energy of Red hidden so secretly…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The red stars that he never would have noticed without Azure.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing that, Seong Jihan could point out the things that had been suspicious.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The World Tree ignition device itself was a bit strange.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The World Tree ignition device.
 </p>
 <p>
  That item, which could burn the World Tree and turn him into the Red Administrator just by pressing a button,
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan broke it, it gave him a whopping 50 Red stat.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If 50 leaked out when it was destroyed, even more Red stat must have been consumed when making that item.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, the Arena Owner had said this was made and handed over by the Black Administrator, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  Now that he had seen the red stars in him, it was hard to believe everything he had said before.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather, he should be suspicious of everything one by one.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Come to think of it, it’s also suspicious that he said the Black and White Administrators are busy with work and want to make Red a permanent administrator…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The absolute beings of this BattleNet world are undoubtedly the Black and White Administrators.
 </p>
 <p>
  If they were busy with work and wanted to make Red a permanent administrator, honestly, they could just burn humanity and end it if they told them to.
 </p>
 <p>
  Would they really need to design things in such a roundabout way?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This bastard is suspicious.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who saw the red stars inside the Arena Owner’s face thanks to the Azure stat,
 </p>
 <p>
  Decided to consider him a minion of Red for now.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile,
 </p>
 <p>
  “After the battle with the Martial God, all the participants on the waiting list withdrew. I even tried greatly reducing the participation fee, but they didn’t want to fight a battle they were sure to lose.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Arena Owner continued speaking calmly, not detecting the change in Seong Jihan’s attitude.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh no, even the Great Constellations didn’t want to participate?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “In the first place, the number of Great Constellations who need the Administrator’s Hand is limited. And among them, the ones who want it the most are the Dragon Lord and the Sun King, but the Dragon Lord suspects the tournament is unfair and the Sun King seems to be distracted by something else.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Lord, who has been insisting on not being able to fight in the tournament after being completely defeated by Seong Jihan’s avatar,
 </p>
 <p>
  And the Sun King, who is distracted trying to take over the Martial God’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  These two, who need the hand the most, were out.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The other Great Constellations withdrew their participation after seeing the power you displayed in Tuseong. They may not know about their own bases, but they don’t want to oppose you in the tournament arena.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so? Even the Great Constellations are less than I thought.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s because you’re too strong.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  Then the universe-like face moved slightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the red stars, which were 30 percent, increased even more,
 </p>
 <p>
  Starting to tint more than half of the universe red.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is he trying to do something?’
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan was paying attention,
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  The Arena Owner slowly spoke,
 </p>
 <p>
  “In this situation, what do you plan to do about the achievement of defeating a Great Constellation while not being a constellation yourself?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, I’m thinking about it. The Dragon Lord and Sun King are my sponsoring constellations, so I’ll have to tell those bastards to summon me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Will they really summon you easily? Especially after you showed such a powerful appearance in Tuseong.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Arena Owner reacted negatively to Seong Jihan’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  He retorted,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, is there a way?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There is.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Flames erupted in front of the Arena Owner,
 </p>
 <p>
  And they soon turned into a huge red gem.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Tell the Dragon Lord you have this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a part of the Dragon Lord’s heart.”
 </p>
 <p>
  This was the Lord’s heart?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recalled when he received Altkaizen’s Dragon Heart before.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It looks similar to that, but the size is on a different level.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Altkaizen’s Dragon Heart was only the size of a fist.
 </p>
 <p>
  This, despite being only a part, was the size of Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You had something like this too?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s one of the things I obtained while chasing the Red Administrator. The Administrator took out a part of the Dragon Lord’s heart to make him completely obedient.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you show him you have this along with the Administrator’s Hand, he will summon you. But,”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  The stars on the Arena Owner’s face moved in unison and looked at Seong Jihan’s right hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t feel any power from your hand?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Administrator’s Hand?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the Arena Owner.
 </p>
 <p>
  He would be caught right away if he tried to lie poorly to the opponent whose stars had already turned more than 50% red.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ashoka sealed it and left.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He… did?”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Ashoka’s name was mentioned,
 </p>
 <p>
  For a moment, the red stars flickered intensely.
 </p>
 <p>
  It felt like he had expressed anger.
 </p>
 <p>
  “For the Dragon Lord to summon you, you need the hand too. No, to be precise, it needs to look like you have it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so? I think the Dragon Heart alone would be enough of a lure.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This matter is for the achievement of becoming a temporary administrator. Wouldn’t it be better to be summoned by him more definitively?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Looks like you have a way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Light flickered on the universe-like face, and it swirled once.
 </p>
 <p>
  And,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
 </p>
 <p>
  From the center of the vortex, a red eye popped out.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is similar to the eye that was embedded in the Administrator’s Hand before.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. It’s an eye that was embedded in the Red Administrator’s body. It may not have as much power as the hand, but it should be able to mimic the appearance.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Squirm.
 </p>
 <p>
  The small eye moving in midair.
 </p>
 <p>
  As it popped out, the red stars that had occupied up to 50 percent of the universe background lost their momentum.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even at a glance, more than half of the red stars had disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Did he share his power with this?’
 </p>
 <p>
  He was really serious about this matter.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the red eye and said,
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re really strange. Why do you have so many things related to the Red Administrator? Someone might think you’re the Red Administrator.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…The Red Administrator had more than a thousand eyes. They are less valuable than the hand. So there are dozens of his eyes stored in the arena.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There are that many eyes?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Of course, this is the limit of what I can take out with my authority.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so? But even this much is a tremendous treasure, are you sure you want to give it all to me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Because it’s important to give birth to an administrator. And…”
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  “What else?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “After defeating the Dragon Lord, you need to think about a way to return, don’t you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  He already had a way to return.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recalled the Golden Wheel and asked him,
 </p>
 <p>
  “What does this eye have to do with returning?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you insert the eye into your hand, you will find out. Because the method is inside it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Arena Owner didn’t talk about the detailed methodology and only said he would know if he transplanted the eye into his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at him with sunken eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing him generously giving the Dragon Lord’s heart and the Red Administrator’s eye,
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if the Azure stat hadn’t activated, it seemed he would have been suspicious of him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But for him to come out so urgently, there must be a reason…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked over the items provided by the Arena Owner and opened his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay. I’ll take this and provoke the Dragon Lord.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You made a wise decision.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But… Inventory.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan opened his inventory and put the Lord’s heart and the Administrator’s eye in at the same time.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re putting the eye in too?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, there’s no need to transplant it right away, right? I went through so much trouble because of the Administrator’s hand.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If the Dragon Lord summons me just by seeing the Lord’s heart, there’s no need to urgently embed that eyeball into the back of my hand.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…That’s true. However,”
 </p>
 <p>
  The red stars in the universe flickered at Seong Jihan’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Dragon Lord won’t be fooled easily like last time. As long as he has the upper hand in summoning, he will dig all sorts of traps in his base and wait for you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then I’ll just insert the eye when I’m in a hurry.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Yes, please make sure to do that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At that answer, the Arena Owner couldn’t tell him to transplant the eye into his hand anymore and took a step back.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then since I delivered the items, I’ll get going.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. I received them well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan saw him off, the Arena Owner slowly faded away.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, and Tuseong has been sealed for three months.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Three months? After all that chaos?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, so it would be best to finish the job within that period. An additional one-year suspension was given… but last time, he caused trouble even while suspended.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I see… Thanks for the information.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After informing him of Tuseong’s sealing, he completely disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is he saying to kill the Dragon Lord and become a temporary administrator within three months?’
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s not much time.
 </p>
 <p>
  He should raise his abilities as much as possible until then.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan checked his situation once.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s dangerous to level up more.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps because he kept the constellation traits on for a long time, going all-out during the battle with the Martial God,
 </p>
 <p>
  The level to reach constellation kept dropping, and now it was 677.
 </p>
 <p>
  With his current level at 650, he would become a constellation by raising his level by only 27.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I was fighting the Dragon Lord 1:1, I would raise my level to the max and fight, but that bastard won’t fight that fairly.’
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s no way he would fight fair and square after summoning Seong Jihan with his lair.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the Dragon Lord gathered all his subordinates and pressured Seong Jihan,
 </p>
 <p>
  He might accidentally become a constellation by killing the Lord’s subordinate dragons and raising his level.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Rather than that, it’s better to train the abilities that have greatly increased this time in this training room.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Since his Martial Soul and Void had risen significantly from the battles in Tuseong,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to firmly internalize the abilities that had risen this time.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I shouldn’t openly use the Azure stat here.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If the Arena Owner found out about Azure, it seemed it would be troublesome.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan focused his training on the other stats, excluding Azure.
 </p>
 <p>
  And,
 </p>
 <p>
  “This should be…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who had been holed up in the training room for a long time,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Enough to go out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  10 days in reality.
 </p>
 <p>
  After completing 1000 days of training based on the Void Training Room’s standards, he came out.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was after he finished preparing to catch the Dragon Lord.

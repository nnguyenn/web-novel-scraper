  Chapter 464
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the broadcasting studio set up in the Daegi Guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who had come out of the training room, decided to turn on BattleTube here.
 </p>
 <p>
  The reason he wasn’t turning it on at home as usual was,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Dragon Lord’s heart has gotten too big.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Lord’s heart, which had been about the size of Seong Jihan when he received it,
 </p>
 <p>
  Was now three times more swollen than that time.
 </p>
 <p>
  He couldn’t fully contain it at home, so he had no choice but to come down to the guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s already in use.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In the largest studio, the Shadow Queen was doing a BattleTube live broadcast with several guests.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan watched quietly from a distance with his arms crossed,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, Boss!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon, the guild master, approached with a delighted face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s really been a long time since I’ve seen you at the guild!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Indeed. It’s been over a thousand days.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh? A thousand days?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was in the training room for that long.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, right. Isn’t the flow of time different inside the training room?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The flow of time in the Void training room was different from Earth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon, who nodded at Seong Jihan’s words, stared at his left face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Boss, but… The cracks on your face seem to have gotten bigger.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so? I guess this happened because I dealt with the Void a bit while training.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is… that okay?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s still not a problem yet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yet…”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Lee Hayeon was examining his face with a worried look,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Guild Master. Here is the data you were looking for… Oh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  A staff member of the Daegi Guild came to report to Lee Hayeon, but upon seeing Seong Jihan’s face, he was startled and shrank back.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before, when people saw Seong Jihan, they used to give him looks of curiosity and admiration.
 </p>
 <p>
  But after the cracks of the Void intensified, there was fear mixed in their eyes when they saw him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon sensed the staff member’s reaction and frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just give it and go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Y-Yes!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The staff member quickly handed the documents to Lee Hayeon and left the scene as if running away.
 </p>
 <p>
  She looked at Seong Jihan and said,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m sorry. I’ll fire that staff member.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, why would you fire him for that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He got scared after seeing Boss’s face.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, it’s understandable to be scared. Even I think I don’t look human.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at his face reflected in a nearby window and nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike when he had a few cracks on his chin,
 </p>
 <p>
  Now his face looked like a shattered window that seemed like it would break if you lightly touched it.
 </p>
 <p>
  On top of that, the purple energy swirling in the cracks gave an ominous feeling.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, it’s really annoying… Last time he was so happy that Boss helped his mother get discharged from the hospital.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Human instinct can’t be helped. Not just that staff member, but many people are scared.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m sorry. I should give them a stern warning later…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon glanced at the staff members in the back with cold eyes,
 </p>
 <p>
  Then spoke to Seong Jihan again.
 </p>
 <p>
  “By the way, did you come to use the studio today?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, the BattleTube I’m doing today requires a large space.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then I’ll kick the Queen out right away.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, it’s okay. Let’s just wait a bit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan raised his hand as if it was fine, but
 </p>
 <p>
  “Everyone, we’ll have to end the broadcast here today.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Shadow Queen had already sensed Seong Jihan’s presence and was hurriedly ending the broadcast.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Huh? Why are you ending it already?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Didn’t you say you were going to do a plastic-feeding experiment on slimes?
 </p>
 <p>
  -For real, if this experiment succeeds, won’t humanity be freed from garbage?
 </p>
 <p>
  -But won’t it become a slime heaven instead of getting rid of garbage ㅡㅡ
 </p>
 <p>
  The people watching the Queen’s channel protested, asking why she wasn’t doing the slime special broadcast, but
 </p>
 <p>
  “The guild owner said he needs to use the studio. The Boss takes priority.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When the Shadow Queen said Seong Jihan had come, the atmosphere completely changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ah then it makes sense.
 </p>
 <p>
  -What are you doing? Hurry up and move.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Are slimes important right now? lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -He’s not filming at home today… Is there something big?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Turn it off quickly!
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I’m going, going.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Shadow Queen waved her hand a few times and turned off the broadcast.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You could have taken your time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How can I make the biggest investor wait? I can use the slime content later. And,”
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Shadow Queen approached Seong Jihan and smiled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m curious what kind of broadcast you’re going to do here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, it’s nothing much.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan walked into the studio and opened his inventory to take out an item.
 </p>
 <p>
  What came out was a huge red gem.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  “They say it’s the Dragon Lord’s heart?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “H-Heart?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Lord’s heart, emitting intense heat and looking like it would burn its surroundings at any moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan blocked this heat from affecting the surroundings.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Why did you take that out?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have to show it to the Dragon Lord.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan turned on BattleTube and calmly replied,
 </p>
 <p>
  “So he’ll summon me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as Seong Jihan turned on BattleTube,
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh, it’s not at home today?
 </p>
 <p>
  -The Shadow Queen said she gave up her spot earlier lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is he going to do guild content? Since he’s broadcasting from the guild studio.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Doesn’t seem like it, there’s a huge ruby next to him.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But why is his face even more cracked?;;
 </p>
 <p>
  -I know… I’m worried it might shatter at this rate
 </p>
 <p>
  Not only the human viewers who were waiting in advance,
 </p>
 <p>
  -It’s been a while since this channel was on.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Come to think of it, the tournament didn’t happen…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Anyone who participates after seeing him fight the Martial God is a fool.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But I didn’t expect even the Great Constellations to back out.
 </p>
 <p>
  But a significant number of alien viewers also immediately joined.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s channel, which had become the most prominent on BattleTube after the battle with the Martial God,
 </p>
 <p>
  Boasted unchanging popularity despite taking a ten-day break this time.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hello, everyone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan lightly bowed his head and tapped the huge gem right next to him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I turned on the broadcast today to show you this item.”
 </p>
 <p>
  -What is that ore?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Looks like he’s not fighting today?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Now that the channel is popular, he’s going straight into sales… I should unsubscribe.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But the magic of fire inside it seems considerable? Depending on the price, it might be worth buying.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan pointed to the red gem next to him,
 </p>
 <p>
  The impatient alien viewers denounced him, asking if he was already advertising now that the channel was popular.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dragon Lord donated 100 million GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [That item, could it be my heart…]
 </p>
 <p>
  When the Dragon Lord shot 100 million and sent a message,
 </p>
 <p>
  -What…
 </p>
 <p>
  -That’s the Dragon Lord’s heart…?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Come to think of it, the Dragon Heart did feel like that ore.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But other dragons’ hearts weren’t that big;
 </p>
 <p>
  -It’s the Dragon Lord. The size would be different.
 </p>
 <p>
  The atmosphere in the chat window that was calling it an advertisement changed at once.
 </p>
 <p>
  “He recognizes his own heart at a glance.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dragon Lord donated 100 million GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [How did you get that… Where did you obtain it from? This is clearly the part I offered before…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Based on him saying he offered it, it seems to be the heart part he handed over to the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan tapped the Lord’s heart with his finger and said,
 </p>
 <p>
  “You know, before you said you’d accept it if I offered myself as a special tribute… But when I tried it today, you refused?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The special tribute where you can offer items to your sponsoring constellation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan had previously said he would offer himself as a tribute item and invade the Dragon Lord’s lair.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Lord had said to come at him all he wanted, that he would show him hell.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But when I actually tried it this morning, this bastard immediately refused.’
 </p>
 <p>
  After coming out of the training room,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan had tried a self-tribute once without using the items the Arena Owner gave him.
 </p>
 <p>
  But,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Sponsoring constellation ‘Dragon Lord’ has rejected the player’s special tribute.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Lord, who had been confident saying to come at him all he wanted, seemed to have gotten scared after seeing the battle with the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  He immediately rejected Seong Jihan’s special tribute.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the viewers who were watching the conversation between the two,
 </p>
 <p>
  -What does that mean? He rejected the special tribute?
 </p>
 <p>
  -He got scared lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -But still, his lair is his home ground;
 </p>
 <p>
  -The Martial God’s place was also home ground.
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  -That’s true. The Dragon Lord probably thought it would only be a headache to summon him, since he won’t combine with a star like the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But still, it’s a matter of pride as a Great Constellation, tsk…
 </p>
 <p>
  They started mocking the Dragon Lord who had refused the special tribute.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the flow of the chat window,
 </p>
 <p>
  “The public opinion isn’t good, Dragon Lord. How about it? This time I’ll go with this, so will you accept it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Tap. Tap.
 </p>
 <p>
  He tapped the Dragon Lord’s heart with his fist.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dragon Lord donated 100 million GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [I don’t care about the opinions of insignificant beings. However… What about your right hand?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Lord abruptly asked about Seong Jihan’s hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why is he suddenly talking about the hand?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Come to think of it, the eyes aren’t appearing on the Administrator’s Hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Isn’t it sealed like last time?
 </p>
 <p>
  At first, the viewers thought the hand was just sealed like last time, but
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dragon Lord donated 100 million GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [I heard the Administrator’s authority has disappeared from your hand.]
 </p>
 <p>
  When the Dragon Lord said that, they showed interest.
 </p>
 <p>
  -The Administrator’s Hand is gone? For real?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Then wasn’t the tournament impossible to hold in the first place? The prize is gone.
 </p>
 <p>
  -It’s fortunate there were no participants;
 </p>
 <p>
  -For real, if it was like “You defeated Seong Jihan, but actually there was no Administrator’s Hand!” the arena would have been turned upside down lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -But who did the Dragon Lord hear that from?
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Dragon Lord and the Administrator’s Hand were mentioned,
 </p>
 <p>
  The alien chat window was flooded with messages within a few minutes of starting the broadcast.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at this and his eyes sank.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Arena Owner must have informed the Dragon Lord of this information.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Telling him to check the Administrator’s Hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  So that Seong Jihan would embed the red eye he received and put in his inventory into the back of his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘For now, should I pretend to go along with it?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan put his right hand into the inventory and grasped the eyeball.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the inventory, the Administrator’s eye was absorbed by his right hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stat ‘Red’ increases by 100.]
 </p>
 <p>
  And as the Administrator’s eye was absorbed and an eyeball appeared on the back of his hand,
 </p>
 <p>
  Red instantly increased by 100.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan took his hand out of the inventory and showed it to the Dragon Lord.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t know where you heard that rumor, but the hand is right here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  -It looked like he put his hand in the inventory… Did he release the seal?
 </p>
 <p>
  -It’s not fake, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Well, the eyeball squirming looks exactly the same as before.
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers were convinced it was the Administrator’s Hand after seeing the back of Seong Jihan’s hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s how identical the movement of the eyeball was to the previous one.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now, are your doubts cleared?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan pointed to the eyeball with his finger,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dragon Lord donated 100 million GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Good. In 3 days, bring the heart and offer yourself as a special tribute. On that day, I will annihilate you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Lord sent a final message after finishing his confirmation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Tsk, just do it now. Why again in 3 days…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps the experience of the avatar’s defeat in the tournament was so great,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Lord was going to summon him later even after checking all the items.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ah, as a Great Constellation, I have to prepare to fight a constellation candidate lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -The dragon race will now receive a total mobilization order.
 </p>
 <p>
  -No, for a Great Constellation, the Dragon Lord is too unsightly…
 </p>
 <p>
  -The image of the great monarch who revived the dragon race has completely vanished this year;
 </p>
 <p>
  -For real, how many traps is he going to set up that he’s asking for 3 days of leeway?
 </p>
 <p>
  The alien viewers understood the Dragon Lord’s intentions and were dumbfounded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, if that’s what our sponsoring constellation wants, I have no choice. See you in 3 days, everyone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  And so, the broadcast ended, and 3 days later.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Sponsoring constellation ‘Dragon Lord’ has accepted the player’s special tribute.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who successfully offered the special tribute and entered the Dragon Lord’s lair,
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’re here.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Now! Ice Breath!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Subdue him immediately!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The moment he was summoned,
 </p>
 <p>
  He received concentrated fire from Dragon Breaths filled with cold energy from all directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  The dragons’ attacks to keep in check Seong Jihan, who dealt with Red.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s face, who was actually receiving the concentrated attacks, was brighter than ever.
 </p>
 <p>
  That was natural.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stat ‘Azure’ increases by 2.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Because an unexpected stat was increasing as he was hit by the Ice Breaths.

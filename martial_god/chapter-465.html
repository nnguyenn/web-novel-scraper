  Chapter 465
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Was Azure also related to cold energy?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Azure stat.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had thought this ability given by Ashoka was specialized only in eliminating red.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s why the grade he received was FFF, wasn’t it?
 </p>
 <p>
  However, this ability increased from the Ice Breaths shot by the dragons prepared by the Dragon Lord.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I thought it had nothing to do with cold energy.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He would need to do some research.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan quietly observed the internal changes while taking the Ice Breaths with his whole body.
 </p>
 <p>
  The rapidly lowering temperature and the cold energy freezing the surroundings,
 </p>
 <p>
  In fact, couldn’t even properly attack Seong Jihan’s Martial Soul domain.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Ice Breaths are persistently trying to seal the power of Red located in the right arm.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Ice Breaths spewing from the heads of hundreds of Silver Dragons,
 </p>
 <p>
  Most of the power was persistently focused on Seong Jihan’s right arm, trying to constrict Red.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was quite a systematic movement to simply be because it was an ice attribute.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was buried in the Ice Breaths,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hoho… Indeed. You can’t easily ignite the fire.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A triumphant voice was heard from afar.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Lord’s excitement could be felt even here.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, Red’s manifestation can’t be blocked to this extent though.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Stat Red, which had become 200 after embedding the red eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the value had greatly decreased compared to before, the power that could be drawn out was stronger than then.
 </p>
 <p>
  The experience of briefly experiencing being the Red Administrator had greatly increased the proficiency of this ability.
 </p>
 <p>
  Honestly, Ice Breaths of this level,
 </p>
 <p>
  Could be completely cleaned up by burning his right hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stat ‘Azure’ increases by 2.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Azure stat rose again,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan just pretended to be hit and stayed still for now.
 </p>
 <p>
  Free stat increases were always welcome.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan stood still and kept taking the Ice Breaths,
 </p>
 <p>
  -No… What? Is it over already?
 </p>
 <p>
  -There’s no way this human would be overpowered so helplessly.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Even if the Ice Breaths of Silver Dragons are powerful, it doesn’t make sense for Seong Jihan, who fought the Martial God, to be unable to move like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Did the Dragon Lord use some special method?
 </p>
 <p>
  The alien viewers couldn’t easily understand the current situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how strong dragons were, the Martial God that Seong Jihan had faced was an extraordinary being that far surpassed them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who had endured against him, was restrained by just this level of attack?
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a situation that was hard to understand.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the viewers were arguing about the current situation without even imagining that his stats were increasing,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stat ‘Azure’ increases by 1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Seems like it won’t increase any further now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the Azure stat that had risen to 10 and sensed that the growth had ended.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since he had absorbed all the power, should he start moving now?
 </p>
 <p>
  As he was about to move,
 </p>
 <p>
  [You were so confident, but is this all you’ve got? You’ll just die like this.]
 </p>
 <p>
  On the contrary, the Dragon Lord started worrying that Seong Jihan might die.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  [Surrender. I’ll show you mercy specially.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Lord said that and stated his conditions.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Take out my heart right now and cut off your right arm to offer it. Then I’ll at least spare your life.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  As the proposal came out, the breaths weakened.
 </p>
 <p>
  Was he giving him some leeway to answer?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that really all it takes?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s right. It will be the day I ascend as the new administrator. I’ll forgive you specially.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Lord, who was already speaking from the position of the victor, tried to continue.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan listened to him for a bit, then shook his head from side to side.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I appreciate that, but… I don’t really need to worry about my life.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Are you deliberately trying to die?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…!
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as those words ended, the Ice Breaths became even more powerful, but
 </p>
 <p>
  “With this, even if I want to die, I can’t.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan’s right arm burned,
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  The Ice Breaths all turned into steam at once and soon disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, the surrounding scenery gradually became visible.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was summoned in midair, surrounded by hundreds of Silver Dragons.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why are there only silver dragons everywhere;
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is this really the Dragon Lord’s Lair? I can’t tell what’s what because I only see Silver Dragons.
 </p>
 <p>
  -It’s also a sight to see dragons sticking their heads out so densely…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Did he mobilize this many dragons just to stop one Seong Jihan?
 </p>
 <p>
  -With this many dragons, you could invade a decent planet.
 </p>
 <p>
  When the Ice Breaths were swept away, all that was visible was a world of Silver Dragons.
 </p>
 <p>
  They really prepared properly for 3 days, Seong Jihan inwardly admired, then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [No… You were able to manifest Red?]
 </p>
 <p>
  From behind the horde of Silver Dragons, the Dragon Lord’s startled voice was heard.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. I was just taking these Ice Breaths for a bit because they were interesting.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Oh no… Yggdrasil. Your method doesn’t work at all!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The name of the Green Administrator, Yggdrasil, came up here?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘When did he get involved?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Before, he threatened to press the World Tree ignition device,
 </p>
 <p>
  But now that the device was broken, there was no way to deal with the Green Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I thought it was strange that Azure increased from being hit by cold energy, but it was taught by Yggdrasil.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Somehow, a method to suppress Red that Yggdrasil had tried was contained in those Ice Breaths.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That attack successfully pressured Red’s manifestation structure.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If it was Seong Jihan before experiencing being the Red Administrator, he would have struggled quite a bit against those Ice Breaths.
 </p>
 <p>
  But not only had his proficiency in Red increased,
 </p>
 <p>
  To the current Seong Jihan, who also possessed the Azure stat, that was just a good opportunity to raise his stats.
 </p>
 <p>
  […Yggdrasil. You were confident you could definitely eliminate Red, what the hell is this!]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Dragon Lord still couldn’t believe the current situation, he denounced the Green Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Cosmic Tree Yggdrasil admires that you handle Red better than before.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [And asks if you have already become the Red Administrator.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Ignoring the Dragon Lord,
 </p>
 <p>
  Yggdrasil had entered Seong Jihan’s channel and was asking him questions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you mean Red Administrator… Why are you helping the Dragon Lord?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Cosmic Tree Yggdrasil answers that it’s all for you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What nonsense is this now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [He says your Red ability has become too strong, so it needs to be controlled at least once here.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [And he points out that the eye shape on the back of your hand seems a bit different from before.]Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan listened to Yggdrasil’s sophistry, then raised his eyebrows at the last message.
 </p>
 <p>
  Honestly, the shape of the eyeball embedded in the back of his hand wasn’t much different from before.
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed, did it look different in the eyes of an administrator?
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yggdrasil! Are you ignoring my words now and talking to that bastard? How much did I give you this time…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, the Dragon Lord, who noticed Yggdrasil talking, became enraged.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the dragons and gestured.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, don’t hide behind the kids and chatter, come out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [What did you say…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “How long are you going to hide behind these Silver Dragons?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan took out the Phoenix Spear from his inventory.
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as he grasped it, the spear instantly ignited.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fundamental Divine Arts,
 </p>
 <p>
  Heavenly Dragon Thunder Fire:
 </p>
 <p>
  Dragon Thunder.
 </p>
 <p>
  As lightning poured from the flames,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The bodies of the Silver Dragons touched by the Dragon Thunder all ignited at once, and the encirclement rapidly began to crumble.
 </p>
 <p>
  [A-Attack again!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [For the Lord!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The surviving Silver Dragons tried to somehow block Seong Jihan’s attack and counterattack, but
 </p>
 <p>
  “These guys won’t do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Zap!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Dragon Thunder flashed once more from the tip of the spear, the Silver Dragons began to be massacred.
 </p>
 <p>
  -No, the dragons… are being swept away like mere mobs.
 </p>
 <p>
  -The Silver Dragons called by the Dragon Lord should be quite strong, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  -There might be constellation-level ones among those dying there? Although their level would be low.
 </p>
 <p>
  -No, didn’t Seong Jihan say he used up all his power fighting the Martial God; He said this is when he’s at his weakest…
 </p>
 <p>
  -You believed those words? Hehe;
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

 </div>
 <p>
  He made such a fuss saying he had become weaker to get people to participate in the tournament.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing Seong Jihan massacring the dragon race, the alien viewers only realized the maxim that there was no one to trust on BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Level increases by 1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan made a dissatisfied expression upon seeing the message that his level had risen.
 </p>
 <p>
  When he wanted to raise it so much, it didn’t go up well,
 </p>
 <p>
  But his level rose immediately after killing just some Silver Dragons.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If this level rises 26 more, I’ll become a constellation.’
 </p>
 <p>
  For Seong Jihan, who had to catch the Dragon Lord before becoming a constellation,
 </p>
 <p>
  The level up message wasn’t very welcome now.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had to catch the Dragon Lord before the level rose further.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can’t see where he’s hiding.’
 </p>
 <p>
  After the encirclement was broken, Seong Jihan looked at the surroundings that had opened up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Under the gray sky,
 </p>
 <p>
  On the flat wasteland, huge eggs were densely standing.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Those eggs… are they dragon eggs? How many are there? Wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  -I thought we’d be summoned to the Dragon Lord’s lair… but it feels like we came to a giant incubation chamber lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -But the Dragon Lord himself is nowhere to be seen.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is that the end of his measures with just the Silver Dragons?
 </p>
 <p>
  For being the Dragon Lord’s lair, there were only eggs in the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at this and his eyes sank.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘To return using the Golden Wheel, I have to finish within a day.’
 </p>
 <p>
  That bastard Dragon Lord.
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering how he was running his mouth behind the Silver Dragon horde, he seems to be here, but
 </p>
 <p>
  Somehow he hid his presence well, so even Seong Jihan’s senses couldn’t detect his existence.
 </p>
 <p>
  The only thing that seemed to have a connection,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Among those eggs, there seems to be a faint trace of the Lord… Do I have to find him by breaking them all?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan moved the spear once.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fundamental Divine Art,
 </p>
 <p>
  Triad of Martial Mastery:
 </p>
 <p>
  Total Annihilation Horizontal Sweep.
 </p>
 <p>
  In an instant, the world was split in half,
 </p>
 <p>
  And the dragon eggs were cut apart all at once.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hazy smoke rose from inside them, and the split eggs shriveled up in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  -All the eggs are breaking. Wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  -The Dragon Lord’s eggs are all being shattered, where did he go?
 </p>
 <p>
  -When did he excitedly run his mouth, and now he’s as quiet as a ghost;
 </p>
 <p>
  -Did he already run away? Lol
 </p>
 <p>
  Even while the eggs were breaking, the Dragon Lord was eerily quiet.
 </p>
 <p>
  From the outside, it really seemed like he had run away.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It still feels like he’s here…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Although he hadn’t pinpointed the Dragon Lord’s location yet,
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed he hadn’t left this place yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Should I break the eggs?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan swung the spear a few more times and shattered the surrounding eggs, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Level increases by 1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  When the level up message popped up again, he stopped attacking for a while.
 </p>
 <p>
  No, how does the level go up just from breaking a few eggs?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘At this rate, I’ll become a constellation from breaking eggs here.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He would have to find another way.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought for a moment, then opened his inventory and took out the Dragon Lord’s heart.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, this is what you were looking for.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Lord’s energy rose from the eggs all at once.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed to resonate with the heart and manifest power, but
 </p>
 <p>
  [Not yet. I have to endure until the reinforcements arrive…]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Dragon Lord said that,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Lord’s energy rising from the eggs quickly subsided.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Ah, this bastard is really persistent.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Because he would lose in a head-on match,
 </p>
 <p>
  Was he trying to somehow hold out while calling dragon reinforcements?
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was pondering how to lure him out,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whirring…
 </p>
 <p>
  Light rose from the eye embedded in Seong Jihan’s right hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I will help you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…You will?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [A pet reacts to its master’s voice…]

  Chapter 466
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan widened his eyes at the remark.
 </p>
 <p>
  Someone who could refer to the Dragon Lord as a pet.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It could only be the Red Administrator.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator, who had subordinate relationships with the Sun King and the Dragon Lord, treating them as his disciple and mount respectively.
 </p>
 <p>
  Only someone of that caliber could call the Dragon Lord a pet.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘In the past, the Administrator’s Hand didn’t seem to show such dominance over the Dragon Lord.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In fact, the presence of the eyeball was much weaker compared to the Administrator’s Hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Stat-wise, too. When embedding the Administrator’s Hand, Red increased by 300, but the eyeball only increased it by 100.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, looking at the current messages,
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to the one constantly referring to its true body, the intelligence and clarity of this eyeball’s speech were unmistakable.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm… This thing seems closer to the Red Administrator.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The arena owner, who seemed to have a connection with the Red Administrator,
 </p>
 <p>
  Had given him this eye, and it was showing its presence at this perfect timing.
 </p>
 <p>
  While it was troublesome that the Dragon Lord’s presence couldn’t be detected, should he follow the eyeball’s instructions?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan pondered briefly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If it doesn’t work out, I can respond with Azure. Let’s hear what it has to say.’
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s the way to summon the pet?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Place your hand on that heart. When you manifest Red, I’ll command the beast.]
 </p>
 <p>
  What a straightforward method.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan put his right hand, which had the eye embedded, onto the heart, igniting the Red flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whiiing…
 </p>
 <p>
  The giant red gem began to glow.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Bow and greet your master, beast.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A powerful voice resonated from inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Pang! Pang!
 </p>
 <p>
  Dragon eggs began to crack and break all around, and the dragon’s aura started to gather.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This… this voice, and such dominance… Is it really the master?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssshhh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon, the serpent-formed Dragon Lord slowly revealed himself from the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Lord, whose head was smaller compared to the avatar form seen before at the tournament.
 </p>
 <p>
  At first, Seong Jihan thought that maybe it was another avatar, not the main body.
 </p>
 <p>
  [To think even my body size has shrunk like before… Does the master’s authority still apply to me…]
 </p>
 <p>
  When the Dragon Lord revealed his confused feelings while looking at the heart, it confirmed it to be the main body.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Immediate effect.’
 </p>
 <p>
  This was the reason why the eyeball was bragging with such confidence.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was about to attack the revealed Dragon Lord when,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, no, Administrator… I am not what I used to be! Now I can defy your orders…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Pong!
 </p>
 <p>
  The serpent form exploded, and the Dragon Lord vanished again.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Ah, that guy ran away again.’
 </p>
 <p>
  What kind of Dragon Lord only knows how to run away?
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s genuinely infuriating.
 </p>
 <p>
  Apparently, it wasn’t just Seong Jihan feeling this way.
 </p>
 <p>
  – He talked big about defying orders, but in the end, he ran away;
 </p>
 <p>
  – Is he really a Great Constellation? Why does he keep running?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Looks like gathering the Silver Dragons for that breath attack was all he had planned…
 </p>
 <p>
  – He really needs to step down from his Great Constellation title.
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers watching were also frustrated by the Dragon Lord’s escape.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  [For a mere beast meant to carry the master, this is an unnecessary struggle.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The eye embedded in Seong Jihan’s hand disdainfully judged the opponent’s escape.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Manifest Red on the heart like earlier. This time, I’ll summon him more forcefully.]
 </p>
 <p>
  It demanded Seong Jihan to exert the same power as earlier.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Fine.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssssshhk…
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan extended his hand towards the heart again and manifested Red,
 </p>
 <p>
  [A punishment is necessary. Beast.]
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, Seong Jihan’s right hand moved on its own, grabbing the Dragon Lord’s heart.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackkk!
 </p>

 <p>
  The heart of the Lord broke into pieces.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Graaaaah…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Screams echoed from the ground as eggs started exploding one after another.
 </p>
 <p>
  It looked as if the eggs were linked to the heart fragments.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Come out.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack!
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan’s hand dug into the broken heart,
 </p>
 <p>
  Sssssh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Smoke thickened among the broken eggs, revealing the serpent-formed Dragon Lord again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Its body was full of holes, bleeding profusely.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Why do I still fall under his control…]
 </p>
 <p>
  The large serpent stared blankly at the sky with its slit pupil.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Lord, treated as a mere pet by the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  After the administrator disappeared, he rebuilt the dragon race and expanded his influence, ultimately becoming a Great Constellation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet at the sound of his former master’s voice, all the strength he had built vanished,
 </p>
 <p>
  Leaving him in a near-death state.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I thought I had escaped…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Switching your heart with eggs to expand your power…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [How did you… No, how do you know, Master?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s all as I designed. In all those years, you have not evolved beyond my design.]
 </p>
 <p>
  […]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked down after hearing that.
 </p>
 <p>
  All those endless eggs, they were all fragments of the Dragon Lord’s heart?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So, breaking them increased my level…’
 </p>
 <p>
  He thought as he recalled the system message from earlier.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Level has increased by 8.]
 </p>
 <p>
  With the eye fully digging into the Lord’s heart and the eggs exploding, his level had dramatically surged.
 </p>
 <p>
  His level had risen by 10 in such a short time after intruding the Dragon Lord.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it rises 17 more, he’ll become a constellation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s finish this quickly.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan drew his sword to eliminate the exposed Dragon Lord.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as he was about to advance,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Seong Jihan, I have something to tell you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You want to talk?”
 </p>
 <p>
  A voice emerged from the eye clutching the heart.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You will soon die.]
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  “I will soon die? What does that mean?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Exactly as it sounds.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  As flames erupted from the shattered Dragon Lord’s heart,
 </p>
 <p>
  The serpent’s head, collapsed on the ground,
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly stood up and approached the floating Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Its slit pupils had turned into red eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Although much smaller in size compared to the one on Seong Jihan’s hand,
 </p>
 <p>
  The semblance was unmistakable—a similar red eyeball.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Could it be… the Red Administrator has taken over the Dragon Lord’s body?’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was definitely different from the Administrator’s Hand.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan concentrated the void into the Eclipse he summoned with his left hand,
 </p>
 <p>
  Determined to use the Taiji Sword if needed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have used the void excessively.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Lord’s eye scrutinized Seong Jihan’s sword and face.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Just like this.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…So, that’s why you say I will die?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The void ultimately guides life to its end.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Sssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  [No one, not even the ‘Administrators,’ can escape this, except for two beings in the universe.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even you, Red Administrator?”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan referred to the eye as the Red Administrator,
 </p>
 <p>
  – What?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Did he say that thing is the Red Administrator…?

 <p>
  – The Dragon Lord’s eyes did change instantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Seems like the serpent tried to resist futilely and got its body taken.
 </p>
 <p>
  – But why does the Red Administrator show up so suddenly after being in hiding?
 </p>
 <p>
  The alien viewers were astonished.
 </p>
 <p>
  The most capable among the BattleNet administrators, who didn’t relinquish his authority after his term ended and remained in hiding,
 </p>
 <p>
  The mythical figure who reappeared caused a surge in viewer numbers, surpassing even when he fought the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course,
 </p>
 <p>
  [I am merely a fragment containing part of the Administrator’s memories. Actually, Seong Jihan, you are the closest to the Red Administrator.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The entity denied being the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan chuckled at that.
 </p>
 <p>
  Subduing the Dragon Lord with a few commands, yet calling him the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright then, fragment of the Administrator, what do you want to say?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Seong Jihan, don’t you wish to live?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Fssshh…
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as those words ended, a crack appeared on one side of the Dragon Lord’s face.
 </p>
 <p>
  It didn’t reveal the void itself,
 </p>
 <p>
  But the broken look was eerily similar to that of Seong Jihan’s fractured face.
 </p>
 <p>
  [To transcend the void consuming you, you must become a Permanent Administrator.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you judged me incorrectly, you would’ve known I’d have pressed that button long ago, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That, I am well aware of.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The giant serpent’s head moved slowly up and down.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Thus, I present you with a new choice.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “A new choice…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Destroy this body.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Sssshh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragon Lord’s head moved closer to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  The distance was now within the range where the opponent could be killed easily without even fully utilizing the Taiji Sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  [And become a Temporary Administrator, choosing Red.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Choose… Red?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Correct.]
 </p>
 <p>
  So, if one becomes a Temporary Administrator, can they choose the color?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan questioned after hearing the suggestion.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But isn’t Red unavailable since you, the Administrator, took its authority and ran off?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Others can’t, but you can. You are part of Red, the crucial core part.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  He was told earlier that he is this era’s heart.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since even this entity emphasizes him as the core part, it must be true.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan nodded, the Red Administrator tried to convince him.
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you choose Red, humanity doesn’t have to be eradicated like before. The Red particles within can be absorbed by you as the Temporary Administrator.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that… possible?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It is possible for ‘us.’ If you become a Temporary Administrator and choose Red, a way will be found.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Flames engulfed the Dragon Lord’s head.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Then, you can revert your void-consumed body,]
 </p>
 <p>
  The previously shattered half of the head returned to its original state.
 </p>
 <p>
  [And we shall become the third Permanent Administrator.]
 </p>
 <p>
  This pitch… was more appealing than the button.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan quietly listened.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Cosmic Tree Yggdrasil urgently warns you not to be deceived by these words.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you become the Red Administrator, you will be controlled by this entity, who warns you against its deceitful tongue.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [While the heart merely beats, the real control lies with the brain, be cautious.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Messages urgently came from the Green Administrator’s side.
 </p>
 <p>
  Choosing Red means an elimination from the Permanent Administrator race, which made Yggdrasil anxious.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yggdrasil is saying that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan mentioned it,
 </p>
 <p>
  [You trust an elf?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator retorted simply.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, he didn’t trust that side but,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Same goes for this one…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan stared at the glaring Dragon Lord.
 </p>
 <p>
  “First, let’s kill the Great Constellation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He moved his left hand wielding the sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thunk!
 </p>
 <p>
  Eclipse penetrated the Dragon Lord’s head.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Great Constellation ‘Dragon Lord’ has been subdued.]
 </p>
 <p>
  An achievement was cleared

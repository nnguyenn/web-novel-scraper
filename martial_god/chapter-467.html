  Chapter 467
 </p>
 <p>
  [As a Constellation Candidate, you have overcome a Great Constellation.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [By clearing an impossible feat, you have gained the qualifications to become a temporary Administrator.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Although they say it’s an impossible feat, it was actually easier than I expected.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Great Constellation Dragon Lord.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was definitely a powerful being, but he was no match for Seong Jihan who had fought against Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  Knowing this well, the Dragon Lord tried to avoid being summoned with various excuses.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the end, when Seong Jihan even revealed his heart, the Dragon Lord summoned him while setting up a trap.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Ice Breath prepared with the intervention of the Green Administrator would have been quite a hindrance if not for the Stat Azure, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  With that shattered, the battle with the Dragon Lord was practically decided.
 </p>
 <p>
  The only issue was that the Dragon Lord shamelessly fled indefinitely, dragging out the time.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Thanks to the Red Administrator, it ended easily though.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Now the real problem began.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan watched the messages for a moment,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The existing Administrators begin voting on the player’s temporary Administrator qualification.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  With a burst of light, the world around Seong Jihan began to change.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Black Administrator expresses their will.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The White Administrator expresses their will.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The most noticeable change was the contrast of black and white dividing the world in half.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sunlight illuminating the Dragon Lord’s planet had disappeared at some point.
 </p>
 <p>
  To Seong Jihan’s left was complete darkness without a single point of light.
 </p>
 <p>
  In stark contrast,
 </p>
 <p>
  On the right, a pure white light completely illuminated the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although only messages about the Administrators expressing their will appeared, the world had completely transformed in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘How overwhelming.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan felt the power of the Permanent Administrators indirectly and realized they were on a different level.
 </p>
 <p>
  If they wanted to, his body could be split in half right here.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But since it said existing Administrators, shouldn’t Green also come?’
 </p>
 <p>
  While he was thinking quietly with his arms crossed,
 </p>
 <p>
  [An avatar of the Green Administrator descends.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Shh…
 </p>
 <p>
  A single green leaf floated in front of Seong Jihan’s eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Black and White expressed their will, Green descended, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  The presence of the Green Administrator was extremely faint.
 </p>
 <p>
  To the point where the light and darkness could easily erase it if they wanted to.
 </p>
 <p>
  And,
 </p>
 <p>
  Shwooo…
 </p>
 <p>
  Green light spread from the leaf and,
 </p>
 <p>
  “As expected, the Black and White Administrators are amazing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The green-haired elf that Seong Jihan had seen before, Yggdrasil, appeared before his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even if I go through the trouble of sending an avatar, it’s completely overwhelmed by the Permanent Administrators’ will.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With the three Administrators revealing themselves like this,
 </p>
 <p>
  – Oh… could this be…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Is he being selected as an Administrator? For defeating a Great Constellation?
 </p>
 <p>
  – I heard rumors before that if you overcome a Great Constellation as a Constellation Candidate, you can become an Administrator, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wow, we’re watching this live broadcast, this is crazy;
 </p>
 <p>
  – No way, how can a mere human become an Administrator…
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s BattleTube showed explosive reactions.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The simultaneous viewer record for BattleTube has been broken.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who saw the message about breaking a new record due to the full attendance of the Administrators,
 </p>
 <p>
  Turned his gaze away from here and looked at Yggdrasil.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why did you even dispatch an avatar?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why else would I come?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yggdrasil smiled at his question.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I came to see with my own eyes if you’re colluding with Red.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “And if I am?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then… I will actively cast an opposing vote.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Come to think of it, this was a vote.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wasn’t the method of becoming a temporary Administrator something you taught me in the first place? You said you would actively help before, but you’re changing your words now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh my, I originally intended to help. However… now that the hidden Red Administrator has revealed traces, I must prepare for all variables.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so? But this vote… isn’t it by majority anyway?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked to both sides.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even if you oppose, if the two Permanent Administrators agree, it’ll be over.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The two of them wouldn’t both agree…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I am in favor of selecting player Seong Jihan as a ‘temporary Administrator’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [I am in favor of selecting player Seong Jihan as a ‘temporary Administrator’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Oh my. This is unexpected.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yggdrasil frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  The selection of a temporary Administrator was done by majority vote.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Currently, there were a total of three Administrators in the BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  With two votes already cast, Seong Jihan’s selection as a temporary Administrator could no longer be stopped.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright! I’ll vote in favor too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now of all times?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have to go with the flow.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Anyways, he was unbelievably shameless.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yggdrasil, as if he had never frowned earlier, smiled brightly and persuaded Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, since it turned out this way… please choose your color wisely.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll handle it myself, so don’t concern yourself.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You know I’m aware of Earth’s location, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Tap.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Yggdrasil snapped his fingers,
 </p>
 <p>
  Screens popped up here and there.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The main forces of the World Tree Alliance are ready to deploy. The moment you choose to be our enemy, humanity will be annihilated.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “When you threaten me like that, it makes me want to choose to be your enemy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m serious. If the Red Administrator rises above me as a Permanent, I won’t have any more chances.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why, that guy could also pull you up to be a Permanent, you know.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha. As if he would.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yggdrasil, who snorted at Seong Jihan’s words,
 </p>
 <p>
  Pointed to the screens and warned him once more.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So I hope you make a wise choice. Otherwise, not only humanity but Earth itself may disappear.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Green Administrator was now threatening to destroy not only humanity but Earth itself.
 </p>
 <p>
  The elven forces preparing to deploy in the dozens of screens that popped up,
 </p>
 <p>
  Looked sufficient to bring about humanity’s downfall, if not planetary destruction.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do not interfere, Yggdrasil.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Leave everything to his choice.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Black and White Administrators each expressed their will,
 </p>
 <p>
  Shwooo…
 </p>
 <p>
  Half of the screens Yggdrasil brought up were engulfed in darkness,
 </p>
 <p>
  And the other half were dyed in light.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  And as the light and darkness disappeared from the screens,
 </p>
 <p>
  Yggdrasil’s main forces were completely annihilated.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wow, wiped out in one shot.
 </p>
 <p>
  – As expected of the Permanent Administrators…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Yggdrasil was acting too cocky;
 </p>
 <p>
  – Even if she commands the World Tree Alliance, she’s no match for the true absolute beings.
 </p>
 <p>
  – The elves’ power got suddenly cut down.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the viewers from outer space admired the power shown by the Permanent Administrators,
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I apologize. I will remain still.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yggdrasil lowered his head and kept his mouth shut.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is like picking your nose without using your hands.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Black and White Administrators.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’m not sure what they’re thinking, but they don’t seem to be so hostile to this side.’
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan was thinking that,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Player Seong Jihan has been selected as a temporary Administrator.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Choose the color that symbolizes the Administrator.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Flicker…
 </p>
 <p>
  Three auras rose up in front of Seong Jihan’s eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Red and blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  And green.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  – Oh… is it time to choose the color now?
 </p>
 <p>
  – The colors that came out are exactly RGB lolll
 </p>
 <p>
  – Seong Jihan became a new Administrator, but the only new color available is blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  – I guess red is gone now, but why did green come out?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Yeah, the Green Administrator is right in front of us
 </p>
 <p>
  The three colors a temporary Administrator can choose.
 </p>
 <p>
  As green was included in this list, the viewers expressed their bewilderment.
 </p>
 <p>
  And Yggdrasil, who was in reflection mode, raised his head with an urgent look.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What… what is this? Why is green here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Beats me. Do I look like I know?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan tilted his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  He expected red and blue to come out, but why did green pop up.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Could it be because of Stat Eternity?’
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s the only thing that comes to mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan was puzzled about why this color appeared,
 </p>
 <p>
  “C-Could it be… that my term has ended due to my earlier mistake?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yggdrasil alternately looked at the light and darkness, asking in a pitiful voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your term has not ended yet.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Even if he chooses green, you will not be replaced.]
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  However, the Black and White Administrators flatly denied that.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Aw, that’s a shame lolol
 </p>
 <p>
  – It would have been a big reversal if he chose green and gulped down the World Tree Alliance…
 </p>
 <p>
  – If that happened, humanity could have ruled over the elves, hehe.
 </p>
 <p>
  – What are you saying; why would humanity rule, it’s Seong Jihan who would rule.
 </p>
 <p>
  As people expressed disappointment at the lost opportunity to dominate the World Tree Alliance,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not… replaced?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yggdrasil’s gloomy face was rapidly brightening.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then there can be… two Green Administrators?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Beyond the relief of not losing her position,
 </p>
 <p>
  Yggdrasil’s eyes shone as she discovered a new possibility.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan, choose green!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Why would I?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If, by chance, the two Green Administrators who became one… combine with each other, we may rise to become Permanent Administrators!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Tak!
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, Yggdrasil placed a hand on her chest.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Allow me to formally introduce myself to you, my partner. I am Yggdrasil. The ruler of the World Tree Alliance, owner of 2,484 planets, and the third wealthiest ‘Green Administrator’ in the universe.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…We’re partners already?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan-nim. You just need to bring your body. I’ll prepare everything for our newlywed home!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [PR/N: the avatar is a girl hmmm….]
 </p>
 <p>
  – Turns out the wife is a universal chaebol?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Hmm… it might not be so bad…
 </p>
 <p>
  – What are you saying, she’s trying to devour her husband;
 </p>
 <p>
  – Yeah, she said they need to combine to become Permanent Administrators, what else could that mean?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What else could it be? She’s saying she’ll devour me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned as he looked at Yggdrasil, whose eyes were sparkling in front of him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’d rather the green light not come out at all.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It needlessly drew the attention of a dangerous being.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you become my partner, I will turn your home planet Earth into the best paradise in the universe. And I will provide an opportunity for all humans to become elves!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, be quiet. I’m going to choose, so shut up for a bit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, wait a moment. Give me some more time to appeal…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ignoring Yggdrasil’s chatter, Seong Jihan looked at the three auras in front of him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The most dangerous order here would be green, red, and then blue.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Red and green.
 </p>
 <p>
  Both were dangerous, but the current Green Administrator seemed more dangerous than red.
 </p>
 <p>
  At least red had some wiggle room for resistance.
 </p>
 <p>
  That side really seemed like it would come out saying let’s fuse the moment he chose green.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s go with blue before she blabbers more.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to go with blue as he originally planned,
 </p>
 <p>
  And reached out his hand towards the blue aura.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, not there, I’m telling you it’s the one next to it…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Yggdrasil cried out with a desperate look,
 </p>
 <p>
  [In the end, you try not to choose red…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  The red eye on the back of Seong Jihan’s right hand glinted.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I will guide you to the right path, Heart.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Administrator revealed their presence, the Dragon Lord’s head that had disappeared,
 </p>
 <p>
  And the eye of the Red Administrator also seemed to lose strength as it closed, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  This was merely a predator hiding its claws.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the decisive moment of choice, the Red Administrator tried to dominate Seong Jihan’s body to make him choose red.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  As red moved inside and Seong Jihan’s body was set ablaze,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Red Administrator… what are you doing to my husband right now?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yggdrasil, with murderous intent in her eyes, exuded an intense energy.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Husband? Don’t say such terrible things, you man-eating spider.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Devour? What do you mean devour? We’re going to combine!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s the same thing.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the two revealed intense hostility towards each other,
 </p>
 <p>
  The energies of the two Administrators were about to clash in a dire moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Black and White Administrators, as if this situation had nothing to do with them, just silently watched.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether red wins or green wins, it doesn’t seem to matter to them.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Then, I should choose blue.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Shwooo…
 </p>
 <p>
  A blue light flickered at Seong Jihan’s left foot.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This is…]
 </p>
 <p>
  For the first time, a perplexed voice flowed from the red eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once it seriously started to move,
 </p>
 <p>
  The blue energy instantly dispelled red’s domination.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Both of you, get lost.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who easily regained his body from the Red Administrator, grasped the blue aura.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have selected blue as your symbolic color.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have become the temporary Administrator, the ‘Blue Administrator’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A message confirming the symbolic color popped up.

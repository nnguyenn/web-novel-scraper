  Chapter 468
 </p>
 <p>
  The Blue Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although it was a temporary title, as soon as Seong Jihan became an Administrator, noticeable changes occurred in his body.
 </p>
 <p>
  First,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The player has surpassed the standards of a Constellation.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Constellation Traits disappears and is replaced by the Administrator System.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You are a temporary Administrator. System access permissions are greatly restricted.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Constellation Traits disappeared and was replaced by the Administrator System.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although he could only use limited authority due to the temporary tag,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It feels much stronger than when Constellation Traits was activated.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps it was because an Administrator surpasses even a Level 10 Great Constellation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to when Seong Jihan fought with Constellation Traits activated, his overall abilities had greatly increased.
 </p>
 <p>
  And with such enhancements,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…I can see how monstrous the Administrators are.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Not only the Green Administrator in front of him,
 </p>
 <p>
  But the will of the Black and White Administrators, divided into light and darkness, also contained immeasurable power.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how much Seong Jihan had obtained the same title of ‘Administrator’ as them,
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather, the power gap that he couldn’t even grasp as a Constellation Candidate,
 </p>
 <p>
  Became vividly felt once he became an Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, in the first place, the reason I became a temporary Administrator is not to catch up to them anyway.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If he had wanted to become a being strong enough to stand shoulder to shoulder with them, he would have chosen red.
 </p>
 <p>
  The reason Seong Jihan chose blue was solely to eliminate the red factor inherent in all of humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  And as he became the Blue Administrator like this,
 </p>
 <p>
  Shwoooo…
 </p>
 <p>
  Stat Azure gathered on the back of Seong Jihan’s hand and began to fully suppress the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Blue Administrator… This power, it has the authority to completely suppress me…! How could you…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Submerged in blue light, the Red Administrator instantly understood Stat Azure.
 </p>
 <p>
  He tried his hardest to resist this power, but as the blue light engulfed him once more, his very existence disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Furthermore, the power of Blue tried to eliminate even the Stat Red inside Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s keep this for now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Seong Jihan decided to keep it for the time being.
 </p>
 <p>
  Blue, which was perfectly controlled according to Seong Jihan’s will,
 </p>
 <p>
  Began an uncomfortable coexistence with Red inside his body.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Blue Administrator… Looking at the current situation, it seems to be a power that counters Red.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan eliminated the Red Administrator like that,
 </p>
 <p>
  Yggdrasil looked at Seong Jihan with sparkling eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a shame you didn’t choose green, but it’s not the worst outcome. Blue Administrator.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You seem quite happy about it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course, it’s good for me if Blue and Red fight each other to the death. I wish you good luck. Please make sure to uproot the Red Administrator.”
 </p>
 <p>
  From Yggdrasil’s perspective, although it was regrettable that he didn’t choose green,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Blue Administrator seemed certain to keep the Red in check, so this could be considered the second-best outcome.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You chose Blue.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [I will respect your choice.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Black and White Administrators did not make much comment on Seong Jihan’s choice,
 </p>
 <p>
  Shwooo…
 </p>
 <p>
  And were slowly retracting the light and darkness.
 </p>
 <p>
  They certainly weren’t as emotional as Red and Green, perhaps because they were Permanent Administrators.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan watched the disappearing will of the two Administrators and then,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Ah, right.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Turned towards where the darkness was and opened his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have a question for the Black Administrator.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Shwoo.
 </p>
 <p>
  At those words, the disappearing darkness stopped.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Red Administrator came from the owner of the arena. To be precise, he came from his face.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Does the Black Administrator happen to know anything about this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan spoke about the arena owner who had given him the eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks to that guy, he was able to obtain the Dragon Lord’s heart and come this far, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If it weren’t for Stat Azure, I wouldn’t have been able to overcome the Red Administrator’s control at the end.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, in the earlier situation, he would have chosen the red light and become the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the eye possessed by the Red Administrator disappeared a moment ago,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recalled that quite a bit of the red light shining from the arena owner’s face still remained.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before that side does something reckless again, he needed to confirm with the Black Administrator if he knew about this.
 </p>
 <p>
  [He… did that?]
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  Shwoooo…
 </p>
 <p>
  A purple vortex rose within the halted darkness.
 </p>
 <p>
  [A being of the Void, unable to accept the end.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As if a model of a circular arena floated above the vortex,
 </p>
 <p>
  The purple light instantly engulfed it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Space Arena is temporarily closed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Arena matches are postponed indefinitely.]
 </p>
 <p>
  In an instant, Space Arena was sealed off.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Huh?
 </p>
 <p>
  – What; Why is it closed?
 </p>
 <p>
  – From what I heard, it seems the arena owner betrayed the Administrators?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Him? Why on earth… The arena owner is one of the highest-ranking beings in the Void.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Based on what was said about being unable to accept the end, could it be that he conspired with the Red Administrator because he didn’t want to die?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Gasp; Hasn’t the arena owner lived for an extremely long time?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Just because you live long doesn’t mean you don’t want to live more…
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the highest-ranking being in the Void, the arena owner.
 </p>
 <p>
  Was the reason he helped the Red Administrator simply because he didn’t want to die?
 </p>
 <p>
  “How much lifespan does he have left to do such a thing?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “For someone like the arena owner… it would be about 5,000 years by your standards.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…If he still has 5,000 years left, there’s plenty of leeway, though?”
 </p>
 <p>
  And that’s based on the current standard of 5,000 years remaining.
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering the initial point when the arena owner first conspired with the Red Administrator,
 </p>
 <p>
  His remaining lifespan would have been much longer back then.
 </p>
 <p>
  But even so, from that time, he was worried about dying, so he joined hands with the Red Administrator?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan tilted his head as if he couldn’t understand, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even if the remaining lifespan is long, the end is still scheduled. The only beings who can extend his life are the White Administrator and Black Administrator… Would they do that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So that’s why he joined hands with the Red Administrator?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, the Red Administrator probably promised to take in the arena owner if he became a Permanent Administrator.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, Yggdrasil smiled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I learned something good this time. Even beings of the Void can be swayed by their remaining lifespan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t tell me you’re thinking of recruiting him?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nah, now’s not the right atmosphere for that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Glancing at Space Arena being engulfed by the Void, Yggdrasil waved at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then I’ll get going, junior.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Junior, huh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since he came in as a temporary Administrator, in company terms, he’d be like an intern.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Before the senior leaves, why don’t you give me some tips as an Administrator?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Tips? Sure, I’ll tell you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Because our junior properly kept the Red Administrator in check. Think of it as a reward for that.”𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  Yggdrasil said so and then, crossing her arms, looked Seong Jihan up and down.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Our junior, even after becoming an Administrator, didn’t get much stronger than expected. Don’t you think so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Well, I guess?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Seong Jihan himself felt that he had become considerably stronger as Constellation Traits was replaced by the Administrator System,
 </p>
 <p>
  From an Administrator’s perspective, he still seemed very weak.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan nodded his head nonchalantly to match her tone, Yggdrasil continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s because the ability related to the symbolic color ‘Blue’ you chose is still weak. The Administrator’s power will also become stronger if you enhance the abilities related to Blue.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re saying I should enhance Blue.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, your ability seems to counter Red…”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Yggdrasil spread her palms,
 </p>
 <p>
  On one side, a blue aura rose, and on the other, red flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  And when she combined them, the flames were extinguished, enveloped by the blue aura.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was similar to how Seong Jihan had erased the Red eye a moment ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The evolutionary effect of extinguishing fire is certainly remarkable. But you need to discover more than that from Blue’s abilities for the Administrator’s power to develop as well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I see… Thanks for the advice.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No problem. You need to be active so that Red bastard can be uprooted.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She’s definitely making it clear that it’s you and me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yggdrasil smiled brightly and waved at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, see you next time, junior.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Shwooo…
 </p>
 <p>
  As Yggdrasil’s figure disappeared like that,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Blue Administrator.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Now that the Administrator selection is over, return to your world.]

 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  Light flickered from the right.
 </p>
 <p>
  A pure white portal appeared in front of Seong Jihan’s eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Was it prepared by the White Administrator?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I was going to use a Golden Wheel, but I’ll save it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded and stepped into the portal.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  The surrounding scenery immediately.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh. U-Uncle?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Changed to inside the house.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as he returned home, the first thing that caught his eye was Yoon Seah lying on the sofa eating potato chips.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the huge TV screen filling an entire wall behind Seong Jihan, this scene was being broadcast live.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What the… What, what. Am I being live-streamed right now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seems so.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No way, this video has broken the viewer record!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah jumped up from the sofa and brushed the crumbs off her face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m not even wearing makeup! And I’m in sweatpants!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Didn’t you often do that when you turned on BattleTube?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That was when I was dealing with people. Uncle’s broadcast is a hot topic across the entire BattleNet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I wondered why she was so startled when she usually broadcasts in comfortable attire.
 </p>
 <p>
  Did she not care about the gaze of humanity but suddenly became conscious of the gaze of extraterrestrial beings?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, to the eyes of aliens, it’s all the same.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Could you tell which of the dragons I swept away earlier was pretty or ugly?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, no, but…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s the same for them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan said,
 </p>
 <p>
  – Is this female the Administrator’s family?
 </p>
 <p>
  – For the Administrator’s kin, her abilities seem lacking…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Didn’t you know? Apart from the Blue Administrator, there are no outstanding individuals among humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  – But those who were disciples of the Martial God, like Ashoka and Dongbang Sak, were strong.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ah, they should be excluded as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Excluding those three, they’re just at the level of a lower species.
 </p>
 <p>
  The aliens showed no interest at all in Yoon Seah’s disheveled appearance.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were busy appraising her abilities.
 </p>
 <p>
  As such chats appeared on the TV screen, Yoon Seah scratched her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, I’m also quite strong now, to the point where I can aim for 2nd place in the human rankings…”
 </p>
 <p>
  – Is she 2nd place?
 </p>
 <p>
  – No, she’d be 1st place now. The Blue Administrator will be excluded from the general player rankings.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Looking closely, it doesn’t seem like she has any abilities at all…
 </p>
 <p>
  – But it can’t be compared to the three.
 </p>
 <p>
  The aliens who had gathered to watch the birth of an Administrator in Seong Jihan’s broadcast, which had the highest viewership ever,
 </p>
 <p>
  Were busy evaluating Yoon Seah, who was now aiming for 1st place in the human rankings.
 </p>
 <p>
  And perhaps because their standards were so high,
 </p>
 <p>
  The evaluation of Yoon Seah was full of criticism.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I’ve only been receiving positive comments from people these days, but suddenly negative comments are pouring in from across the universe.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Should I turn off the broadcast?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, no. I should refer to the analysis of our alien viewers…”
 </p>
 <p>
  While saying that, Yoon Seah rather stared at the chat window with wide eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  – At least her mentality seems usable.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Can you call it usable with just this much? What’s the big deal about being cursed at in the universe?
 </p>
 <p>
  – In the end, ability is everything in this world. This human can’t escape the limitations of her species.
 </p>
 <p>
  – The performance of humanity in BattleNet will also find its place with a player like this being 1st.
 </p>
 <p>
  – But the Blue Administrator will take care of his species to some extent, so it won’t be the same place as before, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  The aliens made comments one after another while looking at Yoon Seah like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even with a generous evaluation, it ended at the level of an ace of a lower species.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, everyone. I’ll end it here for today.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Realizing it was time to wrap up, Seong Jihan turned off the broadcast.
 </p>
 <p>
  “As expected, by the standards of the universe, I’m just a lower species…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, your gift is Late Bloomer, right? You can keep developing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right. Late Bloomer… Even if I hit 1st place in the rankings, there’s still room for development!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Yoon Seah recalled her gift, Late Bloomer, and steeled her resolve,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Hmm, this is?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan detected a strange power from her that he had never felt before.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was very subtly hidden, so he hadn’t discovered it until now.
 </p>
 <p>
  But after becoming the Blue Administrator, he finally discovered the energy of Red.

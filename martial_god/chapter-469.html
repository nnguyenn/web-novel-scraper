  Chapter 469
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, wait a sec.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan reached out his hand towards Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Shwooo…
 </p>
 <p>
  Blue light flowed from his hand and was soon absorbed into her.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, is this the power of Blue? I’m the first among humanity!”
 </p>
 <p>
  At first, Yoon Seah was amazed to see the power shown by Seong Jihan, who had become the Blue Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…But there’s nothing special?”
 </p>
 <p>
  However, when she didn’t really feel any difference, she tilted her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The energy of Red is clearly disappearing, but she can’t feel it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The red energy that appeared in Yoon Seah was actually less than 1 in terms of stats.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was to the extent that it would be extinguished instantly by the Blue sent by Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, to think she couldn’t feel it at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I wonder if others will be like this too?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to look for other cases besides Yoon Seah’s.
 </p>
 <p>
  First,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Jihan, how’s your body?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t feel it from sis.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Huh? What?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Floating in a petrified state, Seong Jiah, who approached Seong Jihan, did not have any red energy detected.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shwooo…
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ve come. No, you’ve graced us with your presence, Administrator.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just speak normally. It doesn’t suit you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If the Administrator specially desires it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even from the Shadow Queen, who rose from the floor and bowed her head to greet Seong Jihan,
 </p>
 <p>
  No red energy was felt.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Shadow Queen wasn’t originally human, so she wouldn’t have Red, and sis became a Constellation in a petrified state, so maybe that’s why.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Both of them, in their current state, could not be considered human.
 </p>
 <p>
  So these two were inappropriate to use as a comparison.
 </p>
 <p>
  He needed to meet people to make an accurate comparison.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are there many people in the guild right now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “In the guild? The Daegi guild is busy every day, so there are always people waiting.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll go for a bit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “To see if others have a fire in them like you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Fire?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Leaving behind the puzzled Yoon Seah, Seong Jihan took the elevator down to the guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, there,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, so no matter how much money it costs, the placards must cover the entire Sword Palace building! We need to make it clear that our Boss has become the Blue Administrator!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…No, who among the people doesn’t know that the Boss has become the Blue Administrator?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Still, we need to properly commemorate it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon was raising her voice at Lim Gayeong, instructing her to make placards.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What placards?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, Boss! No… Should I address you as Administrator now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just do it as usual. But what were you talking about just now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course, we’re trying to celebrate the joyous occasion you’ve achieved this time!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you celebrating again? Wasn’t it enough to live broadcast it on BattleTube?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nah, that’s nothing right now. Not only the Korean government but also the World BattleNet Association is talking about declaring today as a memorial day.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, what, becoming an Administrator is no big deal…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan replied as if it was absurd, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No big deal? This is a joyous occasion for humanity!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s the day an Administrator was born among the lower species, humanity, one of only four in BattleNet. It’s a day that should be celebrated worldwide.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right. Let’s make today a memorial day on par with Christmas, no, surpassing it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The two were burning with determination, insisting that today must be made a public holiday.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If we say it took the Boss 2 days to fight the Dragon Lord and talk with the Administrators, shouldn’t we get 2 days off?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… It didn’t actually take 2 days, though.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Still, most people would want to count it as 2 days.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Somehow, compared to Lee Hayeon, Lim Gayeong seemed to be saying that to increase the number of holidays.
 </p>
 <p>
  After listening to their conversation for a while, Seong Jihan decided to get to the point.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Anyway, can you stand side by side for a moment?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Us?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Following Seong Jihan’s words, the two stood side by side.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can’t see it right away from these two.’
 </p>
 <p>
  While Yoon Seah clearly showed the red factor,
 </p>
 <p>
  For these two, it was at an ambiguous level of being there but not there.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  But one thing was certain: the red factor didn’t seem to be absent.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, let’s take a closer look.’
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Shwooo…
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan manifested the power of Blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, unlike when he lightly examined with the naked eye,
 </p>
 <p>
  The red factor was clearly felt from the two.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Compared to Seah’s, it’s almost one ten-thousandth, no, even less than that.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The red factor possessed by Yoon Seah was less than 1 in terms of stats.
 </p>
 <p>
  What Lee Hayeon and Lim Gayeong possessed was even more minuscule than that.
 </p>
 <p>
  At this level, just being touched by the blue light would be enough to make it disappear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan raised the blue energy more to take a closer look.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh… Is that the light of the Administrator?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, do both of you feel any change?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The blue color looks sacred. My body feels lighter too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, not such superficial comments. Please check for substantial changes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… I don’t really feel anything.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Although they were amazed by Seong Jihan’s blue light, the two said they didn’t feel any particular change in their bodies.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Even if the red factor disappears, they can’t feel it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Not only Yoon Seah but others also didn’t seem to care whether they had the red factor or not.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan left the guild master’s room and conducted a test on the blue energy with the general guild staff as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  “My shoulders were heavy, but as soon as I was exposed to the light, they became light! The aching in my knees has improved too!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…This light doesn’t have such effects. Please honestly tell me only about the changes in your body.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh, w-well then… I’m not sure. It feels like my condition has improved?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as he entered the guild office and manifested the blue light,
 </p>
 <p>
  The red factor of the people inside completely disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps it was because the amount of red they possessed was not even 0.0001.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even without Seong Jihan deliberately bringing the blue energy close, just seeing the light from afar was enough to extinguish the fire.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But Seah is definitely in a league of her own.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the guild office, there were not only ordinary people but also a mage specialized in the fire attribute.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet the red factor they all possessed was the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was so minuscule that just seeing the blue light was enough to extinguish it.
 </p>
 <p>
  But only Yoon Seah had a lot of the red factor…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Come to think of it, they said they would make her the heart instead of me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead of himself, who defied having to play the role of the Red Heart,
 </p>
 <p>
  They tried to choose Yoon Seah as a substitute.
 </p>
 <p>
  Was that why there was such a big difference in ability?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Still, it’s a relief that I’ve eliminated Seah’s red factor.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought so and returned home for now.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had observed the red factor possessed by humanity,
 </p>
 <p>
  And even tried manifesting the blue light to erase it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now it was time to seek the next step.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s go and open the Administrator System.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Administrator System that replaced Constellation Traits.
 </p>
 <p>
  There, perhaps, would be the function Seong Jihan wanted.
 </p>
 <p>
  Judging so, as soon as he arrived home, he tried to open the Administrator System, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, Uncle. You’re back already?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing Yoon Seah waving at him, he doubted his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…The red factor has reappeared?’
 </p>

 </p>
 <p>
  2 hours later.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The red factor reappearing isn’t just limited to Seah.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan confirmed that all the red factors he had erased with his power had regenerated.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I clearly uprooted the red from their bodies, but it eerily reappeared…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The power of Stat Azure was definitely a counter to Red.
 </p>
 <p>
  But even after the fire had evolved once,
 </p>
 <p>
  As if embers were flying in from somewhere, the red factor kept appearing inside humans.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Especially Seah, unlike others, the red is getting stronger and stronger.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Was it because the Red Administrator was considering Yoon Seah as the next target?
 </p>
 <p>
  The red she possessed earlier was less than 1, but the red that reappeared after being erased by Blue,
 </p>
 <p>
  Was now reaching almost 2 in terms of stats.
 </p>
 <p>
  And once it reached this point,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh… Uncle. This time, I feel like something has disappeared.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, who had been unable to feel the red until now,
 </p>
 <p>
  Expressed her puzzlement, saying it felt like something was gone.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There’s a limit to directly erasing it like this.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s eyes sunk deep.
 </p>
 <p>
  By manifesting Blue directly like this, it was impossible to remove the red factor from humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to open the Administrator System.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Although he felt various changes after becoming the Blue Administrator,
 </p>
 <p>
  The biggest among them was the Administrator System that only Administrators could access.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who had not been able to enter the system even once because he was experimenting with Red,
 </p>
 <p>
  Thought that this system was the key to fundamentally solving the red factor.

 <p>
  “Administrator System.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan said that,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Administrator System is opening.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Administrator accessing the system is the temporary Administrator ‘Blue Administrator’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Only a few unrestricted areas are accessible.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Administrator System emphasized that he was a temporary Administrator and opened a part of the system.
 </p>
 <p>
  And what was revealed was,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Why is it so complicated?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Endlessly listed management items.
 </p>
 <p>
  The species and planets Seong Jihan had seen so far,
 </p>
 <p>
  The distorted parts of the system, etc.
 </p>
 <p>
  The targets he could touch as an Administrator were endless.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They’re all marked with an X.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps because he was a temporary Administrator,
 </p>
 <p>
  Planets, species,
 </p>
 <p>
  Even the correction of system distortions were all marked as inaccessible.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then what can I access?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan made a remark after seeing everything marked with an X,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Only accessible management items are displayed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Administrator System erased all the numerous items,
 </p>
 <p>
  And displayed only three items.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Humanity, me, and Stat Azure.’
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how limited the authority of a temporary Administrator was, this was a bit too much.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan quietly stared at the three items,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Administrators exist to develop the BattleNet system.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Administrators gain more authority by resolving distortion phenomena in the BattleNet system.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The current temporary Administrator is an error that goes against the BattleNet system itself because he became an Administrator by defeating an impossible feat.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Find your problems and resolve the distortion phenomena.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Administrator System explained why only three items appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’m an error in the BattleNet system?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan saw this and at first wondered what it meant, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A Constellation Candidate defeating a Great Constellation could be seen as a bug from the system’s perspective.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He soon understood why he was pointed out as a problem.
 </p>
 <p>
  Becoming an Administrator from a Constellation Candidate,
 </p>
 <p>
  Was no different from reaching the summit by taking a helicopter on a hiking trail where you had to climb stairs.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘As a commemoration of becoming a temporary Administrator, it’s telling me to fix the bug that is me before touching anything else.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Administrator System was telling him to fix the bug that was himself first to expand his authority.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, let’s see what kind of problem I am.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan smirked and decided to take a look at what kind of bug he was.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Open the management item ‘Seong Jihan’.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whiiiing…
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as Seong Jihan’s words fell, the screen changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the blue background of the system screen,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s status window was displayed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What is this, it’s just my status window?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The status window listing the stats of Martial Soul, Void, Eternity, Red, and Blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  The values of each ability were not much different from before he became an Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  What bug was he supposed to find here?
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan looked at his abilities with puzzled eyes,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Oh… Something is changing.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Behind each stat, a new evaluation value called ‘Distortion’ began to appear.
 </p>
 <p>
  The stats where the distortion value appeared first were Void and Blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Both are 0.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking at the stats marked as Void (Distortion – 0), Blue (Distortion – 0), Seong Jihan nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Blue was currently an FFF-grade stat whose abilities had not been identified.
 </p>
 <p>
  Void had outstanding output, but it was not an ability that distorted the system in the sense that it led the user to death.
 </p>
 <p>
  And,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Eternity is 30, and Red is 50.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Eternity and Red.
 </p>
 <p>
  These stats, which were no different from an Administrator’s abilities,
 </p>
 <p>
  Had a low distortion score, perhaps because Eternity was incomplete.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then the only one left was Martial Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Martial Soul isn’t an ability that greatly distorts the system…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Why is the evaluation taking so long?
 </p>
 <p>
  Around the time Seong Jihan was puzzled,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s out.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With Martial Soul (Distortion – 52),
 </p>
 <p>
  Martial Soul was unexpectedly measured to have the highest distortion value.
 </p>
 <p>
  No, this shakes the system more than the abilities of Administrators?
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan was looking at this with bewilderment,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The system distortion value of Martial Soul,
 </p>
 <p>
  Was suddenly being upgraded in real-time from 52 to 54.

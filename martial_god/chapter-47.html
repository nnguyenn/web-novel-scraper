 <p>
  Chapter 47
 </p>
 <p>
  11 PM, BattleNet Academy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned upon seeing the reporters gathered at the academy’s entrance.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This brings back unpleasant memories.’
 </p>
 <p>
  They had forcibly interviewed Yoon Seah, who was devastated after receiving an F-rank gift.
 </p>
 <p>
  The relentless pressure from the reporters eventually made Yoon Seah reveal that she had received an ‘F-rank’ gift.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I watched that scene from home, feeling helpless…’
 </p>
 <p>
  His pathetic uncle was no help at all during that time. The interview with Yoon Seah spread widely on the internet, becoming a hot topic among people.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to handle this immediately.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan approached the reporters with a commanding presence, drawing all their attention.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you’re here to interview Seah, you’re wasting your time. She won’t be giving any interviews today. Please leave.”
 </p>
 <p>
  This statement made the reporters hesitate. Especially those who had faced him before seemed more cautious.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I don’t want to be paralyzed again…’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Who knows how long he’ll immobilize us this time?’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Should we pretend to retreat for now?’
 </p>
 <p>
  But a few reporters who hadn’t experienced Seong Jihan’s power before bravely approached him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Excuse me… are you Seong Jihan? Can we interview you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a swift move, Seong Jihan gestured, “No.”Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  His dominating Force pushed the approaching reporters back.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, understood…”
 </p>
 <p>
  While most gave up after being pushed back,
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is unacceptable! How dare you use telekinesis!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s inappropriate for a player to use their powers carelessly, especially against a reporter!
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  You’re denying the people’s right to information!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Two reporters continued to protest vehemently.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This won’t do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a snap of his fingers, the mouths of the two protesting reporters were sealed, and their bodies froze, standing like statues at the school entrance.
 </p>
 <p>
  “He’s got them. He’s really… terrifying.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Guess there aren’t going to be any interviews today.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The other reporters reluctantly retreated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon after, a security guard approached Seong Jihan with a weary expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “These people…When will they be released? You will release them, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, they’ll be released once I go inside.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was worried about what would happen if they stayed frozen like that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But is the academy going to just let them stay out here like?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the guard with an annoyed expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’d prefer not to see them when I come out with Seah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The reporters were quite persistent…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We won’t give any interviews. Surely BattleNet Academy prioritizes its students over reporters, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, you’re right, but…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If those reporters block our car or something…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan gave a chilling smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can’t guarantee what might happen.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The guard felt a shiver down his spine. Seong Jihan’s demeanor was far from ordinary.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood. We’ll ensure they leave.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  The Gift Hall was quiet.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike the entrance, there was no one inside except for a single guard.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you here as Yoon Seah’s guardian?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You can wait at that table over there.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Following the guard’s instruction, Seong Jihan took a seat in the designated area. Checking the time, it was already 11:30 PM.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not long now, Yoon Seah would receive her Gift.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should have looked more into Seah’s Gift in my past life.’
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  However, the reason Seong Jihan valued Yoon Seah’s Gift was simple.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was a Ranker in China with the same Gift as Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  She was the world’s second-ranked player who died during the final demotion match alongside Barren.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Every time I heard about her Gift, I remembered Seah’s death, so I avoided detailed information about it…’
 </p>
 <p>
  While he knew the general story of how the Chinese Ranker had grown, he had avoided delving deeper due to the painful memories.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…At least, I know the direction to nurture that Gift.’
 </p>
 <p>
  That knowledge was sufficient.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan was deep in thought with his eyes closed, a familiar voice sounded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hello~ You’re Seah’s uncle, right? I’m Heesu.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That guy…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  From the corridor, the voices of Kim Heesu and a man echoed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan turned his head. Three people were approaching from the corridor: Kim Heesu, a middle-aged man with a camera, and a muscular young man in a sleeveless shirt.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah will be out soon, right? We have an interview scheduled.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We decided not to do the interview.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, Seah agreed to do it with us.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s eyes grew colder. In his past life, Seah had no friends left, but recently, she seemed close to Kim Heesu.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s no need for it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan replied firmly, but Kim Heesu’s smile widened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We. Agreed. To. Do. It. Right, Cousin?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh~Yes. So he’s that Bronze player?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The young man in the sleeveless shirt walked up, his muscles unnaturally twitching and then solidifying.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stone Skin…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh! Bronze! You have a discerning eye.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Stone Skin was a skill that Warriors could learn at level 50, essential for those who played the role of tankers. Using it so openly meant this young man was over level 50.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You threatened reporters with telekinesis, huh? Isn’t that too much against ordinary people?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just stay put until the interview ends, got it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Also, your niece will be hanging out with me for a while.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Insik blocked Seong Jihan’s path with a smug look.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  “She’ll be an adult after her birthday anyway. So, no big deal, right? Might even pull an all-nighter. Hehe…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s gaze turned icy. Whether it was Kim Gyuhyuk or this guy, there were too many crossing the line.
 </p>
 <p>
  At least Kim Gyuhyuk had a reason, but this guy was just senseless.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan stretched out fingers.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh. You want to show me your telekinesis ability? You think it’ll work on me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Insik spoke confidently, but
 </p>
 <p>
  “You think my ability won’t work on you?” Seong Jihan chuckled, as if amused.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How about now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan pulled his finger back,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wh…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  A tearing sound came from Kim Insik’s head.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’ve turned 18 years old and awakened as a player.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’ve received a Gift.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Phew…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah sighed unknowingly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thankfully, she had obtained a Gift.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even for students of the academy, the chance of getting a Gift was not more than 50%.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  More than half of the awakened players didn’t have a Gift, so she was off to a good start.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Status Window.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah opened her status window and her eyes widened.
 </p>
 <p>
  The very first stats shown were Strength, Agility, Stamina, and Magic Power – all of them were recorded as 10.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were maxed-out stats!
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah felt a surge of pride without realizing it.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  But that joy was short-lived.
 </p>
 <p>
  The most crucial part was yet to come – the slot for the Gift at the very bottom of the status window.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, the initial stats were an essential factor in determining a player’s talent.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  However, the grade of the Gift was even more vital in determining whether one would remain an amateur or turn professional.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah’s eyes widened once more as she saw her Gift.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Gift – Late Bloomer (Rank F)]
 </p>
 <p>
  “F…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Rank F for the Gift.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how random Gifts were…She never expected to receive such a rank.
 </p>
 <p>
  She slumped down, feeling as if she couldn’t stand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even after awakening as a player and feeling healthier than before, she felt paralyzed.
 </p>
 <p>
  …It was cold.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite being summer in August. She felt a chill throughout her body.
 </p>
 <p>
  She couldn’t believe what she was seeing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hoping it was just a dream, she closed and opened her eyes repeatedly.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the Status Window was ruthless.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Gift – Late Bloomer (Rank F)
 </p>
 <p>
  [Great potential takes time to manifest.]
 </p>
 <p>
  And there was even such a careless description.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was simply absurd.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah’s head drooped.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Haha… Haha…”
 </p>
 <p>
  She let out a bitter laugh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her dreams had shattered.
 </p>
 <p>
  It felt as if the whole world was crumbling around her.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Worst birthday ever.’
 </p>
 <p>
  What should she do now?
 </p>
 <p>
  She hadn’t considered the possibility of receiving an F-rank gift.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can’t become a player now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With an F and an ambiguous Gift called “Late Bloomer”, the prospects of becoming a BattleNet player weren’t bright.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Should I prepare for college entrance exams?’
 </p>
 <p>
  At least she had maintained good grades, so as not to tarnish the name of the Sword King.
 </p>
 <p>
  She sighed again.
 </p>
 <p>
  She just wanted to sit down and do nothing.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If it was going to turn out like this, why did the Gift Gem shine so brightly?…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Gift Gem, which shone even more brilliantly than that of a senior who received an S grade, had falsely raised her hopes.
 </p>
 <p>
  She almost shed tears thinking about how hopeful she had been just moments ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I won’t cry.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After taking a deep breath, Yoon Seah stood up.
 </p>
 <p>
  What’s done was done.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her uncle would be waiting outside, so she couldn’t stay slumped here forever.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Come to think of it… did Uncle know something?’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Yoon Seah left the Gift Hall, she recalled how Seong Jihan had consistently emphasised that ‘Gifts are random’ recently.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had stressed the randomness to such an extent that at times, it felt somewhat hurtful.
 </p>
 <p>
  But after receiving an F, she felt grateful for his words.
 </p>
 <p>
  If she hadn’t been prepared by his talks, her disappointment would have been even more profound.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘First… let’s get out quickly. And… I should thank Uncle.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Step by step, Yoon Seah tried to compose herself, rubbing her eyes as she slowly exited the Gift Hall.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  As she opened the door,
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  She saw something floating in mid-air and upon closer inspection,
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Is that, hair?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Short strands of sandy-yellow hair which was clumped together with wax was floating in the air as if it were a clump of weeds that had been plucked out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Beyond the man’s hair, which looked like it was styled after a Japanese samurai was…
 </p>
 <p>
  “It works, huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Her Uncle, with one corner of his mouth raised, was making a gesture with his fingers.

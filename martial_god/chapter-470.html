  Chapter 470
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The distortion value is rising in real-time…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Could something be happening in the sealed Tuseong?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s eyes sank as he watched the distortion value of Martial Soul grow.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Come to think of it, the performance of Martial Soul seems to have improved too.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Until now, he thought his abilities had only been amplified after becoming the Blue Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  But it seemed that Martial Soul was also a cause for his body feeling lighter.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Martial Soul is the ability of the Martial God, but…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Martial Soul, the unique ability possessed by the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  The rise in the distortion level of Martial Soul was no different from saying that the Martial God had developed it.
 </p>
 <p>
  But Seong Jihan recalled the Martial God he had seen in Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although his power was overwhelming,
 </p>
 <p>
  He wasn’t really a being that fit well with martial arts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The name Martial God suited Dongbang Sak better.’
 </p>
 <p>
  But would it be possible for such a Martial God to raise the distortion level of Martial Soul in such a short time?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm… at this level, could it be that he even swallowed Dongbang Sak?’
 </p>
 <p>
  For Seong Jihan, who couldn’t know what was happening in Tuseong, he could only make such speculations.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment,
 </p>
 <p>
  An exclamation mark appeared next to the Martial Soul stat.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What’s this? Is it telling me to press it?’
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan pressed the exclamation mark,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whiiiing…
 </p>
 <p>
  [The distortion level of the stat ‘Martial Soul’ has risen abnormally.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Would you like to identify the cause of the problem?]
 </p>
 <p>
  A new message window popped up above the status window.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Of course I need to identify it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan pressed yes,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whiiing…
 </p>
 <p>
  A new screen appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first thing that caught his eye was Dongbang Sak sitting cross-legged.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Dongbang Sak… he wasn’t devoured by the Martial God.’
 </p>
 <p>
  But seeing that he was identified as the cause of the rise in Martial Soul’ distortion level,
 </p>
 <p>
  It was clear that he was influencing Martial Soul in some way.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan continued to stare at the screen for now.
 </p>
 <p>
  […]
 </p>
 <p>
  With his eyes closed, his seated body slowly rose,
 </p>
 <p>
  And a pure white light began to bloom around him.
 </p>
 <p>
  What the light took the form of was a single sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was similar to the Taiji Sword that Dongbang Sak had taken out from the Taiji.
 </p>
 <p>
  And,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Insufficient.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As Dongbang Sak’s mouth opened,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  Light exploded on the screen, and dozens of swords of light began to rise.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each one contained absolute power, the swords of light.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at them closely.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Looking closely, they seem slightly weaker than the Taiji Sword.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps because they were directly created instead of being drawn from the Taiji,
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to the main Taiji Sword, the swords of light seemed to lack power.
 </p>
 <p>
  But even so, they were only slightly weaker and still possessed a threatening power.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, the number of swords was much greater.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan counted the number of swords of light Dongbang Sak had formed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ’54.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A total of 54 swords of light were created.
 </p>
 <p>
  This number was definitely the same as the distortion value of Martial Soul he had seen a moment ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  And,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  As light flashed in the air and one more sword was created,
 </p>
 <p>
  The distortion level of Martial Soul in the status window also rose to 55 in real-time.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The number of swords of light Dongbang Sak creates is truly proportional to the distortion level.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s eyes flashed as he watched the real-time changes.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how much the Martial God didn’t actually suit martial arts,
 </p>
 <p>
  He thought that the growth of Martial Soul’ distortion level was ultimately possible only if the Martial God directly developed Martial Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  So he wondered if he had swallowed Dongbang Sak or something.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Just by Dongbang Sak training, Martial Soul develops.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Martial Soul, which was said to be the ability of a star.
 </p>
 <p>
  Was the source of this ability actually coming from Dongbang Sak?
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Indeed, when the distortion level of Martial Soul changed from 54 to 55,
 </p>
 <p>
  Even Seong Jihan could feel a slight increase in the power of Martial Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Dongbang Sak trained, he was also influenced in a way.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Gosh, even after becoming an Administrator, I think I’ll have a hard time against that old man…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Although he could clearly feel that he had become stronger after becoming the Blue Administrator,
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps it was because the reference ability of Blue, Stat Azure, was still nothing special.
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to other Administrators, his abilities were definitely lacking.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this state, if he faced Dongbang Sak, he would honestly lose.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The cause of the rise in the distortion level of the stat ‘Martial Soul’ has been identified.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Would you like to rectify the problem?]𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  [You can restrain the target using Administrator authority.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A new message appeared in the status window.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even such things are possible with Administrator authority?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Now it felt a bit like being an Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded his head while looking at the system message, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  [It is an ability related to the Administrator. You can properly reverse it by consuming authority.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Consuming authority… It’s saying I’ll use something.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the system message precisely said consuming authority instead of using it, he frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this also using some kind of points?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s similar. Would you like to quantify Administrator authority?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even after becoming an Administrator, there’s no free lunch in this world.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan nodded, an Administrator authority item appeared at the top of the status window.
 </p>
 <p>
  Administrator Authority – 12000
 </p>
 <p>
  “If I rectify the distortion of Martial Soul, how much authority will be used?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [500 is consumed per distortion level of 1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can’t even reduce it all? Then it’ll end after reducing 24.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the swords Dongbang Sak had manifested.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if you subtract 24 from 55, 31 will still remain.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘And Dongbang Sak will develop it back to 55.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Then it would be like wasting Administrator authority.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sealing Dongbang Sak was something he could attempt only when he had accumulated more authority.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If resolving the distortion weakens Martial Soul, I need to consider whether it’s beneficial to me or not.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the various stats Seong Jihan possessed, the most central ability was undoubtedly Martial Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how much the system told him to rectify the distortion level, there was no need to already choose a path of weakening while using authority.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll hold off for now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Understood. The current screen will be terminated.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “End? Can’t you keep it on?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan asked with a hint of regret as the screen that allowed him to spy on Tuseong for free was disappearing.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The current location is a sealed area. Starting 10 minutes later, 100 authority will be consumed per minute to maintain playback.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, is that so? Turn it off right after 10 minutes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as it was said that authority would be consumed at a rate of 100 per minute, any lingering attachment disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  He couldn’t waste the mere 12000 authority just to watch Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But I can watch it for 10 minutes without any cost.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking so, Seong Jihan quietly stared at the screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak, floating in the air, moving the 55 swords of light.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  Sensing the transcendent power contained in each sword, Seong Jihan suddenly thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Come to think of it, that Martial God really doesn’t do anything…’
 </p>
 <p>
  He thought Martial Soul was an ability with the Martial God as the main axis.
 </p>
 <p>
  Was this also a structure that exploited Dongbang Sak?
 </p>
 <p>
  Come to think of it, among the abilities of Martial Soul, there was one that copied and mastered all martial arts of humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Could this also turn out to be a manifestation of Dongbang Sak’s talent?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What the hell does the Martial God even do?’
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan was lowering his evaluation of him by another level,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stop.]
 </p>
 <p>
  From within the screen, the Martial God’s voice was heard telling Dongbang Sak to end his training.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Martial God.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [I told you not to train the Taiji Sword in here.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [This sword is not the Taiji Sword…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Seeing that it can’t be analyzed, isn’t it a similar type?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Shwooo…
 </p>
 <p>
  In front of Dongbang Sak, a red light flashed.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the light spread, it began to examine the swords one by one.
 </p>
 <p>
  [With this much, even the Sun King would be subdued without resistance. Stop training.]
 </p>
 <p>
  […Understood.]
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  [Then, as soon as the seal is lifted, hunt down the Sun King.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes, Martial God.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak, who had been floating in the air, had already come down and knelt before the red light.
 </p>
 <p>
  Certainly, his every movement was loyal, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I will emphasize once more. From now on, do not do any kind of training.]
 </p>
 <p>
  […Yes.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God emphasized once more for Dongbang Sak to stop training and disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Martial God has been suppressing Dongbang Sak’s potential until now…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The current Dongbang Sak, who was already a monster.
 </p>
 <p>
  But if he continues training and develops further and further, he may even escape his control.
 </p>
 <p>
  With such thoughts, the Martial God seemed to have strictly controlled Dongbang Sak’s training.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘With this, the distortion value of Martial Soul won’t grow for the time being.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Unexpectedly, the Martial God is playing a restraining role.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan stroked his chin and watched Dongbang Sak put away the swords.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although he appeared to be a loyal subject of the Martial God on the outside,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Asoka said that Dongbang Sak locked himself inside the Taiji Sword to avoid revealing his true intentions.’
 </p>
 <p>
  And he said that if the Taiji Sword was drawn out during the battle with him, he would come to his senses and help.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that time, he optimistically thought that it would be fine if he fought with all his strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Now that I see it, I need to destroy those 55 swords.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The swords of light, possessing unique power, even if not on the level of the Taiji Sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  He didn’t know how strong they were, but while all other martial arts could be mastered through Martial Soul,
 </p>
 <p>
  Those, like the Taiji Sword, could not be analyzed or copied by Martial Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking at the swords, Seong Jihan recalled Asoka’s last words.
 </p>
 <p>
  – If you can’t draw out the Taiji Sword, you and humanity will all die at Dongbang Sak’s hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before becoming an Administrator, he thought, ‘No, that much should be possible.’
 </p>
 <p>
  But after seeing the 55 swords, the difficulty had skyrocketed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s rather fortunate that Tuseong is in a sealed state.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps because the grade of Stat Azure was too low,
 </p>
 <p>
  Even after becoming the Blue Administrator, he had not yet gained the strength to subdue Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had to quickly obtain power befitting an Administrator, taking advantage of the sealed state of Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  [10 minutes have passed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Beep.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the screen turned off with that message, Seong Jihan tried pressing the other abilities that had distortion levels.
 </p>
 <p>
  But unlike with Martial Soul, no screens appeared for Red and Eternity.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why don’t these have problem identification or rectification screens?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan asked that,
 </p>
 <p>
  [They are abilities of beings with higher authority than the temporary Administrator. You do not have access rights.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The system drew a line, saying that unlike Martial Soul, he did not have the authority to modify the two abilities.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Then there’s practically no way for me to resolve the distortion phenomena?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Martial Soul can’t be done because authority is lacking.
 </p>
 <p>
  Red and Eternity can’t be modified because they are abilities created by beings of higher rank than him.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this situation, how was he supposed to resolve his own distortion phenomena?
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan expressed such doubts,
 </p>
 <p>
  [A temporary Administrator does not necessarily need to rectify distortion phenomena.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The problem of an Administrator is possessing distorted abilities. Abandoning distorted abilities is also a way to resolve distortion phenomena.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The system message suggested a different solution.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, this was,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Abandon abilities? That won’t do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a proposal that Seong Jihan could not accept.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I abandon Martial Soul, Red, and Eternity, Constellation Candidate Seong Jihan would be stronger.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If he deleted all those abilities, the only things left are Void and Blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  With this, drawing out the Taij Sword from Dongbang Sak would become even more impossible.
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you cannot delete all distorted abilities, we recommend deleting at least some of them.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you maintain the current abilities, 50 Administrator authority will be consumed per day.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you delete the stat ‘Red’, 100 Administrator authority will be added per day.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the system message and did a simple calculation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The value of Red is about 150 authority per day.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Currently, when maintaining abilities, it’s -50 per day.
 </p>
 <p>
  If Red is deleted, it becomes +100, so it can be said to have a daily value of 150.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Since Red’s distortion level is 50, I guess it subtracts about 3 per distortion level then.’
 </p>
 <p>
  After becoming an Administrator, it’s making me do arithmetic.
 </p>
 <p>
  While figuring out the Administrator authority calculation method, Seong Jihan asked the system.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Instead of forcibly removing my abilities, wouldn’t it be better to increase the daily incoming amount? How do I increase the daily authority?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [To increase the daily authority acquisition amount, you need to develop abilities related to your symbolic color.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The grade of the stat ‘Blue’ related to the symbol is too low. Raise the grade of Blue.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather than reducing consumption, it’s enough to earn a lot.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Open the management item, stat ‘Blue’.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With that mindset, Seong Jihan opened the ‘Blue’ item, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  [There is no information about the stat ‘Blue’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [This ability cannot be upgraded currently.]
 </p>
 <p>
  That attempt encountered a reef from the very beginning.

  Chapter 471
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nothing seems to work for a temporary Administrator.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned upon hearing that upgrading Blue was impossible.
 </p>
 <p>
  He thought there would be significant changes upon becoming a temporary Administrator, but there were just too many restrictions.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The stat ‘Blue’ is a new ability without existing data.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Once the temporary Administrator grasps Blue, it will then be possible to upgrade it.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [TL/N: Blue and Azure are the same stat]
 </p>
 <p>
  A message appeared to answer Seong Jihan’s thoughts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since Blue was a new ability that had never existed before, it implied that Seong Jihan needed to understand this ability first before upgrading it would be possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I have no more information than that it’s hostile to Red.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Since the original creator of the stat was Ashoka, Seong Jihan didn’t have detailed information about it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering the color was blue, he experimented with various attributes, thinking it might be related to water, but found no significant connections.
 </p>
 <p>
  All he knew was that Blue was hostile to Red and effectively eliminated it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There’s no need to open this management item anymore.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Since it was impossible to upgrade Blue before acquiring more information, Seong Jihan closed the management item for the stat ‘Blue.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The only management item he hadn’t opened yet was.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Humanity.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He had already checked ‘Seong Jihan’ and ‘Blue.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Only ‘Humanity’ remained.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I suppose editing Humanity might also be restricted for a temporary Administrator.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering there was hardly anything he could do with the other two management items he had already checked, Seong Jihan didn’t have high expectations for the Humanity item either.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Humanity]
 </p>
 <p>
  Evaluation Level – Low
 </p>
 <p>
  For Humanity, designated as a low-level species,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Basic Species Information]
 </p>
 <p>
  [BattleNet Player Basic Stats]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stat Weighting]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hidden Abilities]
 </p>
 <p>
  Starting with BattleNet-related stats, an enormous amount of data was included.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Moreover, I can edit this information…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s eyes glowed upon seeing the edit button next to each item.
 </p>
 <p>
  At last, he felt like an Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  After reviewing several items, he decided to test something.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How much authority would it take to increase physical strength?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Would you like to increase Stamina by 1 point?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [This species is drawing the attention of all Administrators.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Modifying it will consume a lot more Administrator authority.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Administrator authority consumption: 100,000]
 </p>
 <p>
  A hundred thousand.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Giving up Red would allow me to add 1 point to Stamina every 1000 days.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Stamina +1.
 </p>
 <p>
  This stat was important in BattleNet but even more crucial for humans living in reality.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he could enhance this once every 1000 days, he’d practically be seen as a god.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But I can’t waste authority on things like this.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to save the humanity Stamina boost for later and continued examining other entries.
 </p>
 <p>
  After opening several items for a while,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hidden Abilities]
 </p>
 <p>
  Red Factor
 </p>
 <p>
  ??
 </p>
 <p>
  He found something related to the Red factor in the hidden abilities section.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So the species Humanity inherently contains the Red factor.’
 </p>
 <p>
  No wonder people continued to regenerate Red even after erasing it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan pondered after seeing Humanity’s information window.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though he became the Blue Administrator, he still lacked substantial authority.
 </p>
 <p>
  And Humanity remained vulnerable to becoming kindling for the Red Administrator at any time.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘And Seah could end up being the spark that ignites that kindling…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing this, it was clear that the first task was to remove the Red factor from Humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan attempted to modify the Red factor from the hidden abilities section.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Would you like to remove the Red factor?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [This species is under the scrutiny of all Administrators.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Modification will consume a lot more Administrator authority.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Administrator authority consumption: 1,000,000,000,000]
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  The modification required a trillion authority.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Are you serious? How many zeros is that?’
 </p>
 <p>
  He barely has 12,000 authority right now, and it suddenly demands a trillion?
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan stared in disbelief at the system message,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ding.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Fellow junior.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A message window with a green background appeared before Seong Jihan’s eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  If someone refers to him as a junior…
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yggdrasil?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Correct. How is it being an Administrator?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [As a temporary one, there isn’t much I can do.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [But you should be able to edit species. Can’t you remove the traces of the Red Administrator from Humanity?]
 </p>
 <p>
  As expected from Yggdrasil, who had been encouraging Seong Jihan to become a temporary Administrator since his days as a Constellation Candidate.
 </p>
 <p>
  He immediately brought up the topic related to the Red factor.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes, there is a modification button for the Red factor.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [See? But I guess your authority isn’t enough.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s right. Did you predict this?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Heh, the ‘Red Administrator’ implanted the Red factors into Humanity. It’s not easy to remove them with temporary Administrator authority.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Saying that it could be easily solved once he became a temporary Administrator, only to now say he lacks authority…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This seems to have some ulterior motive.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was thinking that,
 </p>
 <p>
  Words appeared again in the green message window.
 </p>
 <p>
  [But don’t worry. I’ll lend you the authority.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Lend me… Is that even possible?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes, formal Administrators can do it. I’ll only charge 1% annual interest. But if you can’t repay it, you’ll have to join the World Tree Alliance.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Joining the World Tree Alliance… So this was your plan all along.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘You said it could be easily solved if I became a temporary Administrator.’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Now you tell me I lack the authority and expect me to become your subordinate by lending me authority.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [Heh, you can’t fail to repay 1% interest in a year, right?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [No, I can’t repay it. 1% of a trillion is a hundred billion.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Sorry, what did you just say? A trillion…?]
 </p>
 <p>
  After hearing Seong Jihan’s reply,
 </p>
 <p>
  Yggdrasil’s message paused for a moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  [Uh, wait… Is that true?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes, removing it costs a trillion.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s hard to believe. Can you send me a screenshot of that message?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [For free?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Alright.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Next to Seong Jihan, another message window popped up.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Green Administrator ‘Yggdrasil’ grants you 10,000 Administrator authority.]
 </p>
 <p>
  10,000 just for taking a screenshot?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Really generous.’
 </p>
 <p>
  After receiving the authority, Seong Jihan passed the message to Yggdrasil.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Red Administrator… This is insane.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [So, can you lend me a trillion?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Let’s just extinguish humanity. How about that?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Get lost.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Even the Green Administrator doesn’t seem to have a trillion in authority.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan closed Yggdrasil’s message window, dismissing the suggestion to eliminate humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Buzzzzzz…
 </p>
 <p>
  [Wait, listen. The cost being a trillion might be due to Humanity’s large population. How large is the human population?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [7 billion?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [That many? Let’s just kill everyone and leave about a thousand people. Can’t they repopulate?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Typical thinking for the Green Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  [No, just leave.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Come on… Fine. If you leave only a thousand people, I’ll support you for free. No interest, just pure authority transfer. How about that?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Even after refusing, he persisted.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan realized that telling Yggdrasil to get lost wouldn’t work.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if he closed the message window, he’ll keep sending messages.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘And blocking him might prompt him to invade Earth.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He was genuinely serious about countering the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  He needed to provide a reasonable answer that she could accept.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I have a solution of my own.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [A solution?]
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  [Yes, so I’ll call when I need authority.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan answered and then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Beep.
 </p>
 <p>
  Closed the message window with Yggdrasil.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Red factor… Maybe Ashoka’s method was right.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He recalled when he acquired the stat Blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Acquiring the FFF-grade ability, ‘Blue’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [When the stat Blue increases by 1, Red factor disappears.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [When Red factors are entirely removed from Humanity, the species’ evolution limit is reset to ‘mid-upper species.’]
 </p>
 <p>
  The system message at that time definitely said increasing the Blue stat by 1 would eliminate the Red factor.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s impossible to modify Red factors through Administrator System. But what about granting the Blue stat?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Yggdrasil’s method was blocked, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  Granting the entire humanity the FFF-grade stat Blue could be different.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan went to the Humanity basic stats window and opened Administrator System.
 </p>
 <p>
  When he attempted to add the Blue stat,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Would you like to grant the Blue stat as a basic ability to all humanity?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [For Humanity, the Blue stat will be FFF-grade and cannot be upgraded by the Administrator.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Administrator authority consumption: 1,000,000]
 </p>
 <p>
  It asked for a million authority.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A million… Surprisingly not that expensive. Maybe because of the low grade.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering adding a new ability to all humanity, and it’s an Administrator’s ability at that, it’s not a hefty sum.
 </p>
 <p>
  This low grade might work in his favor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even so, there’s no way to prepare a million authority immediately.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This, I’ll need to borrow.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan sent a message to Yggdrasil.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I’ve found a viable method.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Already?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes, but I need a million authority. Lend it.]
 </p>
 <p>
  […Do you think I’m a charity?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You want to capture the Red Administrator the most, right?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [That goes for you too, doesn’t it?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Not quite. After experiencing being a temporary Administrator, I’m considering just becoming a full-fledged Red Administrator…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stop with the nonsense… Show me some proof about needing a million.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon Yggdrasil’s request, Seong Jihan sent over the earlier message.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Granting the Blue stat to all humanity… That’s a feasible method.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Right?]
 </p>
 <p>
  […Alright. I’ll invest a million then. Just make sure you get it done.]
 </p>
 <p>
  He agreed to invest right away.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, compared to a trillion, a million is nothing.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan awaited the transfer,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Green Administrator ‘Yggdrasil’ grants you 1,000,000 Administrator authority.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Oh… he just gave it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Green Administrator’s authority came in as a grant, not a loan.
 </p>
 <p>
  [To just give away a million… You are generous, senior.]Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  [Heh, it’s tough to hear that from you. Now get it done and show me.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Of course.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who for the first time addressed the Green Administrator respectfully and treated him as a senior,
 </p>
 <p>
  Began the process of granting the Blue stat to humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ding.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The species ‘Humanity’ has no knowledge of the Blue stat.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [If the species ‘Humanity’ gains awareness of the Blue stat, the cost of authority consumption can be reduced by up to 50%.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A system message that caught Seong Jihan’s attention appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If humanity learns about Blue, the authority consumption reduces by half?’
 </p>
 <p>
  This… If he informed everyone about Blue, he could save half of the million granted by Yggdrasil?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can’t resist a half-price discount.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Right there and then, Seong Jihan opened BattleTube.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hello everyone. This is my first broadcast since becoming an Administrator.”
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh…
 </p>
 <p>
  -The Administrator has started a stream..
 </p>
 <p>
  -Going live so soon after becoming an Administrator… This guy is really something.
 </p>
 <p>
  -This guy? Are you referring to the Blue Administrator like that?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Right. The Administrator has transcended species limits already…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The moment he started the broadcast,
 </p>
 <p>
  Alien viewers swarmed in faster than human ones.
 </p>
 <p>
  After watching the escalating viewer reactions for a moment,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Now, let’s begin.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing that an adequate number of human viewers had gathered, Seong Jihan began to speak.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Today, I have an important announcement regarding humanity.”

  Chapter 472
 </p>
 <p>
  -???
 </p>
 <p>
  -Important announcement?
 </p>
 <p>
  -What could it be…? It’s not something like leaving Earth, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  -If it were something like that, why would he even bother making an announcement? lol
 </p>
 <p>
  Given that Seong Jihan was making a significant announcement soon after becoming an Administrator, people waited anxiously to hear what he had to say.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Today, I will give you all a new stat.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan got straight to the point.
 </p>
 <p>
  -A stat…?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is he giving out stats to celebrate becoming an Administrator?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Will it be for regular players only, or everyone?
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m giving it to everyone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow, this is huge
 </p>
 <p>
  -We get a stat for free just because an Administrator emerged from humanity?
 </p>
 <p>
  -This is insane lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -What stat is it?
 </p>
 <p>
  At people’s queries, Seong Jihan smiled and began to explain.
 </p>
 <p>
  “As you know, my Administrator color is blue. Some of you might have wondered why it’s blue… Today, I’ll be giving all humanity the stat that turned me into the Blue Administrator.”
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow, the Administrator’s stat…?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is that even possible?
 </p>
 <p>
  -How extensive will the distribution be?
 </p>
 <p>
  -For today, being a low-level species has its perks…
 </p>
 <p>
  Hearing that he was giving out the Administrator’s stat, ‘Blue,’ even before humanity, alien viewers were the first to react with shock.
 </p>
 <p>
  How much must the Administrator value his species to share the ability that made him an Administrator?
 </p>
 <p>
  As the aliens were expressing envy for humanity,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The species Humanity has recognized the name ‘Blue’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The cost of Administrator authority consumption has decreased by 5%.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing that the authority consumption only decreased by a mere 5%, Seong Jihan steeled his resolve.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Just mentioning the granting of Blue doesn’t significantly reduce the cost. I need to reveal all the facts now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Due to recent events, humans had developed many questions related to Red.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially since the idea of setting all humanity on fire to become the Red Administrator had been mentioned multiple times on Seong Jihan’s channel, conspiracy theories about this topic were rampant online.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was the only one who knew the answer, but since he was an untouchable being, people could only speculate.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Previously, there were no means to eliminate the Red factor, so I couldn’t disclose it…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, as long as I grant the Blue stat, Red factor will disappear. It’s better to reveal this information too.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Some of you might be wondering why I’m suddenly giving this ability. Before I distribute it, I want to explain my reason for granting Blue to humanity.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Buzzzzzz…
 </p>
 <p>
  As he spoke, Seong Jihan displayed a screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since becoming an Administrator, he could now bring up any screen he desired just by thinking about it.
 </p>
 <p>
  He actively utilized this ability.
 </p>
 <p>
  What he first showed was the ‘Hidden Abilities’ section of humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is an ability all humans possess.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hidden Abilities]
 </p>
 <p>
  Red Factor
 </p>
 <p>
  ???
 </p>
 <p>
  -Red Factors?
 </p>
 <p>
  -??? What does that mean?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Even as an Administrator, he can’t reveal everything?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Did humanity actually have so many hidden abilities?
 </p>
 <p>
  -But why is Red coming up here?
 </p>
 <p>
  As humans were debating about the hidden abilities, Seong Jihan pointed to Red Factor with his finger.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Many of you probably had questions after watching my BattleTube broadcasts. Why does setting humanity on fire lead to becoming the Red Administrator? Why do the Absolute Beings become anxious over pushing certain buttons?”
 </p>
 <p>
  -Well…
 </p>
 <p>
  -The last time, you said you didn’t know the exact reason lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -So there was something after all…
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded at the people’s reactions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. I knew it since then, but I didn’t reveal it to prevent social disorder. But now it’s time for you all to know the truth.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Tap.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan tapped the Red Factor on the screen,
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Buzzzzzz…
 </p>
 <p>
  A new screen appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  It displayed a giant with red eyes embedded all over its body.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Humanity was created to turn the Red Administrator into a ‘Permanent Administrator.’ To be precise, the existing humanity was replaced by the current New Humanity.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With this, the faces of Gilgamesh and Pythia appeared next to the giant.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The replacement of Old Humanity with New Humanity was achieved through these two, as you saw before.”
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow, those two… So they were really like Adam and Eve?
 </p>
 <p>
  -I can’t believe I’m a descendant of Gilgamesh, that jerk ㅡㅡ;
 </p>
 <p>
  -I just feel disgusted…
 </p>
 <p>
  Learning that humans with Red Factor had roots tracing back to Gilgamesh made people react negatively to Seong Jihan’s revelation.
 </p>
 <p>
  The impression Gilgamesh left on BattleTube was overwhelmingly negative.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The species Humanity has recognized ‘Red Factor’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The cost of Administrator authority consumption has decreased by an additional 15%.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Talking about Red Factors brought an additional reduction in cost.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So, it totals 20%.’
 </p>
 <p>
  This wasn’t bad, but it could still be reduced further.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan continued,
 </p>
 <p>
  “With Red Factor present, humanity will forever be a tool to evolve the Red Administrator. Even though I’ve prevented it several times, that’s only a temporary fix. In the future, the Red Administrator can still emerge…”
 </p>
 <p>
  -The Red Administrator is like a parasite on humanity…
 </p>
 <p>
  -But if Seong Jihan remains an Administrator, won’t he take care of it?
 </p>
 <p>
  -He’s already stopped it multiple times, hasn’t he?
 </p>
 <p>
  -We can’t rely on one person forever; we need a permanent solution.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But what solution is there? How do we eliminate Red Factors?
 </p>
 <p>
  -That’s for Administrator Seong Jihan to figure out…
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the reactions pouring in about eliminating Red Factors, Seong Jihan nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There is a solution.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Buzzzzzz…
 </p>
 <p>
  As he spoke, Seong Jihan displayed a face on the screen.
 </p>
 <p>

 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is that person…?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ashoka?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yeah, the Constellation who saved Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  -I remember Buddhists were trying to claim him because of his Thousand Hands and Thousand Eyes form lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -But why is he showing this person now?
 </p>
 <p>
  The face that appeared was Ashoka.
 </p>
 <p>
  After saving Seong Jihan, Ashoka had become the most favored among the Constellations by the general public.
 </p>
 <p>
  In India’s Hinduism, there were even voices advocating for Ashoka to be incorporated into their pantheon.
 </p>
 <p>
  The image of Ashoka’s impressive display still lingered vividly in humanity’s minds.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The one who gave me the stat ‘Blue’ is Ashoka.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Showing Ashoka’s face, Seong Jihan revealed,
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have acquired the FFF-grade ability, ‘Blue’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [When the Blue stat increases by 1, Red Factor disappears.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [When Red Factor are completely removed from humanity, the species’ evolution limit is reset to ‘mid-upper species.’]
 </p>
 <p>
  Buzzzzzz…
 </p>
 <p>
  Displaying the information he had seen when he acquired the Blue stat.
 </p>
 <p>
  -The Blue stat…
 </p>
 <p>
  -It’s FFF-grade
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is it possible to grant it to everyone because of its low grade?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Hey, but if the Red Factor disappear, the evolution limit is set to mid-upper? So, it’s not infinite like before?
 </p>
 <p>
  -That’s kind of disappointing.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Seriously… We got upgraded from lowest to lower species thanks to Seong Jihan, shouldn’t we be satisfied?
 </p>
 <p>
  -True, even reaching mid-level is amazing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some people felt disappointed that the Blue stat only eliminated Red Factors and changed the evolution limit to mid-upper.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, they were soon flooded with responses from other viewers pointing out that even reaching the lower species tier was thanks to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  -And humanity was created to evolve the Red Administrator…
 </p>
 <p>
  -That’s why humanity didn’t have an evolution limit?
 </p>
 <p>
  -To reach the Permanent Administrator tier, the species needed to be limitless.
 </p>
 <p>
  -How did Ashoka create such an ability? A stat solely for countering Red…
 </p>

   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  -But didn’t Seong Jihan make a poor choice? The symbolic color’s ability seems too weak.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Seriously, FFF-grade?
 </p>
 <p>
  Alien viewers, observing the Blue stat, criticized Seong Jihan’s choice, claiming it was a poor decision.
 </p>
 <p>
  They had expected a powerful new symbolic color ability but were disappointed to find it only eliminated Red with no other significant effects.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Did he choose that color just to eliminate Red Factor?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Foolish move…
 </p>
 <p>
  -He’s too tied to his species. As an Administrator, he should transcend those constraints.
 </p>
 <p>
  -If he chose Red or Green, he would have been absorbed by those Administrators. Blue was a better choice.
 </p>
 <p>
  -We’ll see in the long run.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Who knew a lower species like humanity would produce an Administrator?
 </p>
 <p>
  As aliens debated Seong Jihan’s choice of color,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The species Humanity has fully recognized ‘Blue’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The cost of Administrator authority consumption has decreased by an additional 30%.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan received a message indicating that humanity fully recognized the Blue stat.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s done.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks to the announcement, most humans had gathered on Seong Jihan’s BattleTube channel.
 </p>
 <p>
  Awareness about Blue spread rapidly among people.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Now, it’s time to grant the ability.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan opened the Humanity management window to use his Administrator authority.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then… I will now use my Administrator authority to grant the ability.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Opening the Humanity management window and accessing the stats,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Would you like to grant the Blue stat as a basic ability to all humanity?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [For humanity, the Blue stat will be FFF-grade and cannot be upgraded by the Administrator.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Administrator authority required: 500,000]
 </p>
 <p>
  He used the discounted Administrator authority.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh…
 </p>
 <p>
  -It really got added?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow, it applies even at Level 1?
 </p>
 <p>
  -It didn’t feel real till now…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The reactions poured in instantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  For BattleNet players at or above Level 2, or even those living ordinary lives at Level 1, everyone saw Blue 1 appear in their status window.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow, high-level players are saying they got Blue in both status windows lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -The system is thorough…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Does this mean Red Factors… are gone?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Are we really free now?
 </p>
 <p>
  As people saw Blue appear, the chat was exploding.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, uncle. I got it too…! Wow… This is amazing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah said as she stood before Seong Jihan, showing him her status window.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the very bottom, ‘Blue’ had appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s no need to allocate more points, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  At her question, Seong Jihan observed her.
 </p>
 <p>
  The red energy, far more prominent in her than in others, was vanishing rapidly with the granting of Blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If it disappears this quickly for Seah, it should be the same for others.’CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the red’s energy vanish from his most worrisome niece, Seong Jihan grinned.
 </p>
 <p>
  “1 point is enough. Everyone else shouldn’t allocate more either. It’s just a waste of points. This stat only eliminates Red.”
 </p>
 <p>
  -The Administrator’s stat… I wish we could do more with it lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -Honestly, someone will waste points on it.
 </p>
 <p>
  -True lol There’s definitely someone who will.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Btw, has the Red Factor truly disappeared?
 </p>
 <p>
  Noticing the chat’s reactions, Seong Jihan nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now that Blue had been granted, it was time to check the Hidden Abilities section to confirm the disappearance of Red Factor.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let me check.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan reopened the Humanity management window and the Hidden Abilities section.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hidden Abilities]
 </p>
 <p>
  ???
 </p>
 <p>
  Red Factors were gone, leaving only ??? in the Hidden Abilities section.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What could this be?’
 </p>
 <p>
  As he pondered the ??? mark,
 </p>
 <p>
  Sssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Hmm?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Letters started forming in the ??? mark, as if to answer his curiosity.

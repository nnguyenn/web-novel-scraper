  Chapter 473
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hellbound From Hell]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hell?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan felt puzzled after noticing the word that appeared in place of the ???.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hell? The term is typically used to describe the afterlife or the underworld, isn’t it?
 </p>
 <p>
  Was this hidden ability, which was previously shrouded with ???, actually tied to Hell?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Hell?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why is Hell suddenly mentioned…?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Are we falling into Hell now that the Red factors have disappeared?
 </p>
 <p>
  People quickly picked up on Seong Jihan’s muttering and started to question among themselves.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Hell? Does he mean the Void?
 </p>
 <p>
  -It must be that. The final destination of all beings is the Void. So, when they say Hell, they must mean the Void.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But why specifically mention the Void here?
 </p>
 <p>
  Alien beings watching the broadcast quickly assumed that Hell meant the Void.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Seong Jihan thought otherwise.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm… This doesn’t seem to be the Void.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The concept of beings ending up in the Void usually signifies death, which makes sense in the BattleNet context. But why would such a thing be hidden under ???
 </p>
 <p>
  After pondering for a moment about what Hell might entail, Seong Jihan decided to reveal everything.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ve already exposed so much. I might as well reveal this too.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He decided to harness the power of collective intelligence.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Everyone, the Red factor have disappeared, but something like this has appeared instead.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan revealed the term ‘Hellbound From Hell’,
 </p>
 <p>
  -What?
 </p>
 <p>
  -So Hell is real?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow… There really is an afterlife?
 </p>
 <p>
  -See, this is why you should believe in religion! Or you’ll end up in Hell, lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  -So believing in Seong Jihan is enough? lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yeah, let’s trust in the Administrator for salvation.
 </p>
 <p>
  As people reacted to the revelation that Hell might be real, some even started to joke about forming a religion around Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, the alien viewers had a larger reaction.
 </p>
 <p>
  -No way, the system actually verifies Hell?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is the system message genuine?
 </p>
 <p>
  -The Administrator revealed it, so it must be true;
 </p>
 <p>
  -The concept of Hell shouldn’t be separate from the Void… Why is such a term used specifically?
 </p>
 <p>
  -It’s strange that this appears as a hidden ability.
 </p>
 <p>
  The majority couldn’t understand why this was hidden from them, why it wasn’t classified as the Void.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment,
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’ve uncovered even this, it seems.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A voice, familiar yet unsettling, resounded in Seong Jihan’s ears.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This voice… It’s unmistakably….’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the voice of the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite supposedly being erased during the selection process, not all of him seemed to have vanished.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You insidious bastard… Does this Hell have to do with you, Red Administrator?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan said this,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Unc… Uncle! Look outside!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, her face pale with shock, pointed out the window.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why? What’s wrong?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The… The whole world… It’s turned red.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Her voice trembled with fear as she described the world turning red.
 </p>
 <p>
  But,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Seah, what are you talking about?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t feel anything unusual.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Those watching at home, including the petrified Seong Jiah and the Shadow Queen, didn’t sense anything out of the ordinary.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  -Huh?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Did you hear that?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yeah, he said something about uncovering everything…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is it just my eyes, or has the world turned completely red?
 </p>
 <p>
  -The sunlight is totally crimson now;
 </p>
 <p>
  -It’s nighttime here, but the moonlight is blood-red,
 </p>
 <p>
  In contrast, human viewers all seemed to have similar responses to Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  They too had heard the Red Administrator’s voice and noticed the world turning crimson.

 <p>
  “Is this… only affecting humanity?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Since Seong Jihan had transcended humanity by becoming an Administrator, this phenomenon didn’t affect him.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jiah was petrified, and the Shadow Queen was a Shadow Elf, so neither of them seemed affected as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  [So… I really might not be considered human anymore.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s why I told you to use the key and revert to being human quickly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Offering a brief word to the feeling of isolation Seong Jiah was experiencing, Seong Jihan stepped outside to get a clear look.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘While I can’t feel the world turning red… there is something off up there.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The sky above, with the sun appearing as usual, seemed normal.
 </p>
 <p>
  But from the direction of the sun, a faint red energy was emanating.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh… Why do I keep looking at the sun…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s really hurting my eyes, but I can’t stop…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  People on the ground, too, were staring at the sky with confused and disturbed expressions.
 </p>
 <p>
  To be precise, they were all staring at the sun.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to trace this red energy.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan ascended into the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The red energy grew increasingly intense.
 </p>
 <p>
  And as he ascended, the sky too began to turn red, just as the humans had described.
 </p>
 <p>
  -The Red Administrator is linked with Hell…?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Did he create this Hell system separately from the Void?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Isn’t the realm of death under the jurisdiction of the Black Administrator…? He’s really crossed a line;
 </p>
 <p>
  -Does the Void not care about this?
 </p>
 <p>
  -The Black Administrator didn’t seem aware of his subordinate colluding with the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Permanent Administrators might not be as omnipotent as we thought…
 </p>
 <p>
  The consensus was that Hell should be within the realm of the Void, controlled by the Black Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  That the Red Administrator had managed to create something separate yet overlapping with the domain of the Void led to doubts about the Black Administrator’s true power.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan arrived at the source of the powerful red energy emanations.
 </p>

 </p>
 <p>
  Hovering over Seoul, a gigantic red eye was staring at him.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Blue Administrator. I admit it. The plan to make me a permanent Administrator through humanity has failed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The pulsating movement of the enormous eye made Seong Jihan furrow his brows.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Red Administrator…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Following the revelation of the Hellbound From Hell ability, the red eye had abruptly appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  This eye was the most significant and powerful manifestation of the Red Administrator Seong Jihan had encountered so far.
 </p>
 <p>
  Particularly,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…It’s likely because of this hidden Hellbound ability. Energy is flowing from the earth towards here.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The world had turned completely red.
 </p>
 <p>
  Humans, despite the pain in their eyes, couldn’t stop staring at the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator’s eye was gradually absorbing the energy from those people.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where have you been hiding? Here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I am everywhere. My appearance manifests because Hell has been revealed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hell… What is that exactly?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Surprisingly, the Red Administrator readily answered Seong Jihan’s question.
 </p>
 <p>
  [It is a system designed to efficiently utilize a core resource: humanity.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “A system?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Indeed. Currently, the Black Administrator monopolizes the management of the dead through the Void. But this Void leans excessively towards ‘annihilation,’ squandering resources inefficiently…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Resources…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You were designed as a resource to elevate me to a permanent Administrator. You cannot be used frivolously. Thus, the Hell system was created to monopolize even your deaths.]
 </p>
 <p>
  He regarded humanity as a core resource.
 </p>
 <p>
  Alive, they nurture the Red factor. Dead, they’re drawn into Hell for reuse.
 </p>
 <p>
  “And you managed to keep this hidden from the Void?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Permanent Administrators don’t bother observing lower species in detail. Besides, as you know, I had a collaborator.]
 </p>
 <p>
  He was referring to the Arena Owner.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s mouth curved into a sneer.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What now? Your collaborator has been unmasked, and Hell has been revealed. When the Permanent Administrators catch you, it’s over for you too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Heh. I am not bound to any one place. I am everywhere…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so? Then stop clinging to humanity and entertain yourself elsewhere.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I intend to.]
 </p>

 <p>
  The Red Administrator surprisingly agreed with him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes.]
 </p>
 <p>
  With that,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Above the red eye, another scene began to unfold.
 </p>
 <p>
  It showed Ashoka, who had defied the Red Administrator after gaining enlightenment.
 </p>
 <p>
  -The five enlightened beings before you all chose to turn away. But defiance… interesting. One finally provides a bit of entertainment after such a long wait.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Administrator had actually welcomed this act of defiance with joy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although this was all Seong Jihan had seen from Ashoka’s memory.
 </p>
 <p>
  -I… I will turn away…
 </p>
 <p>
  -We were all under your control…
 </p>
 <p>
  -We cannot cooperate with you. Forever, I shall avert my gaze from the sky, never looking at humans, and live with my eyes on the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  Prior to Ashoka, the enlightened beings.
 </p>
 <p>
  All had chosen to avert their gaze, unable to bear looking at the sky, their heads bowed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Perhaps that was the natural choice.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red factor pervaded humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  On top of that, there was Hell created by the Red Administrator hidden in the heavens.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite understanding the world’s workings and distortions, choosing defiance, like Ashoka, wasn’t easy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Turning a blind eye and continuing to live was the best option.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I did not consider Siddhartha to be a variable. I merely regarded him as a diversion.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yet, he created The Martial God within infinite regressions, and through you, he has even exposed Hell…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  The eye glowed with a red light.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Humanity. You are now free. I shall withdraw my hand from you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator declared he would withdraw from humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet Seong Jihan remained cautious.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…If you’re withdrawing, why is the Hellbound ability still here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The hidden ability, ‘Hellbound From Hell,’ persisted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Moreover, the energy from the earth is still streaming in.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The human energy rising from the ground was growing stronger.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The investment needs to be recouped, after all.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Twitch.
 </p>
 <p>
  The eye emphasized the need to recoup the ‘investment,’ burning brightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Of course, he wasn’t going to leave quietly.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan prepared to draw his sword and spear to attack the eye,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is there really a need to fight?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  A bowler hat appeared out of nowhere, and the Arena Owner revealed himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Arena Owner, you’ve changed a lot.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This face?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Under the bowler hat was a face shaped like the cosmos.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the once intricate cosmos was now riddled with red holes, giving an impression that it could collapse at any moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m now just as damaged as your half-mask.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you get punished by the Black Administrator?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, I fled as soon as you became an Administrator, but my old Master was just too powerful…”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a flick, the Arena Owner inserted and removed his fingers from the holes in his face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, now that I’ve lost the Arena, I need a new title. Luckily, the Red Administrator decided to govern Hell.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Should I call you the Owner of Hell now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Hmm… In your world, I guess the terms Hades or King Yeomra fit? Anyway, until I decide, just call me the Owner of Hell.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sorry, but I’m going to destroy that. So, you won’t be the Owner of Hell.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Haha…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Arena Owner laughed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve been observing you. Even as the Blue Administrator, you’re quite powerless…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No matter my condition after being punished by my previous Master, you’re no match for me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The fierce aura of the Void mixed with a red essence began emanating from the holes in the cosmic face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Given all the grievances I hold against you—losing the Arena, getting punished by my Master—it’s quite a list.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What a shame.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even so, given all our past dealings, I’d prefer to part amicably.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Arena Owner, having amplified his power, spoke again.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So please, stay still if you wish to survive.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a grin, Seong Jihan countered,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do I really seem like someone who would do that?”
 </p>

  Chapter 475
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Manifestation of Blue.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Emitting blue energy was possible even now.
 </p>
 <p>
  But manifestation seemed to be something else.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The function has been unlocked, so I should try it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Following the system’s guidance, Seong Jihan tried manifesting the blue energy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, from his body, a blue light flowed out.
 </p>
 <p>
  [According to the Administrator’s imagination, the form of Blue is revealed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Swooosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Above his head, an object was created.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is… a wheel?’
 </p>
 <p>
  A golden wheel imbued with a blue glow.
 </p>
 <p>
  It didn’t have a skull like Ashoka’s, but anyone could see it resembled his golden wheel.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clank…
 </p>
 <p>
  As the wheel moved, blue energy spread in all directions, starting to sever the red lines.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The speed has increased drastically.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The blue-glowing golden wheel showed the optimal effect in severing the red lines.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Blue stat, which had been stuck at 100 and not increasing,
 </p>
 <p>
  [A significant portion of the red’s distortion has been reversed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Blue stat increases by 10.]
 </p>
 <p>
  was rising dramatically through interaction with the golden wheel.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Hell system’s foundation is collapsing… How can the Hell I’ve built up for so long be blocked by something like that?]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the destruction accelerated due to the manifestation of Blue, the red pupils reacted intensely.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seems like you’re starting to feel it crumbling now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s words, the pupils wriggled and looked at the Arena Owner.
 </p>
 <p>
  […Now is not the time to defend this place. Go and stop him! At this rate, the Hell you are to inherit will disappear.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swooosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The Arena Owner pulled back about half of the Void energy surrounding the pupils.
 </p>
 <p>
  He then gazed at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bzzzt!
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, a barrage of red beams poured down.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Total Annihilation rushed to destroy Seong Jihan and the golden wheel floating above his head, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  Clank…
 </p>
 <p>
  As the wheel moved once, the Total Annihilation disintegrated and vanished in midair.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh my… Your authority is truly threatening to the red.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When the Total Annihilation, the strongest in destructive power among the red abilities, disappeared so weakly,
 </p>
 <p>
  red energy stopped flowing from the hole-filled face of the Arena Owner, and Void energy rose up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “However, if that overwhelming power… only applies to ‘red’, you won’t be able to subdue me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re quite confident for someone who was defending by laying out Void energy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Until a moment ago, I thought I could win by just buying time. There was no need to confront the inner Void.”
 </p>
 <p>
  From their perspective, as long as they defended Hell, their ‘investment’ would pay off even if they just bought time before Seong Jihan severed the red lines.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Arena Owner didn’t need to take the risk of facing the Taiji Sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  But now the situation had turned 180 degrees.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan had the advantage if he bought time, and they were the ones being chased.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then.”Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Arena Owner instantly stood in front of Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come, receive this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He spewed out Void energy from his entire body.
 </p>
 <p>
  An attack method aiming for Seong Jihan to absorb the Void energy and self-destruct.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…For now, I need to avoid it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If the cracks on his face progressed further here, it would be irreversible.
 </p>
 <p>
  To avoid absorbing the Void energy, Seong Jihan stepped back for the time being.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where are you going…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kwak!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Arena Owner grabbed the golden wheel floating in the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  “My, my… It rapidly devours the red I possess. However,”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swooosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  As violet Void energy flowed from his hand,
 </p>
 <p>
  the golden wheel slowly melted away.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Dealing with it using Void energy is simple.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The form of Blue is annihilated.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Blue stat decreases by 5.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the blue-glowing golden wheel disappeared, the stat decreased by 5.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Blue ability, in the end, is merely the antithesis of red.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Listening to the mocking words of the Arena Owner, Seong Jihan inwardly thought,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What he said isn’t wrong.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Blue stat, which had risen to C-grade.
 </p>

 <p>
  However, the ability it possessed was still specialized only against red.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, the very reason this ability was created in the first place was to eliminate the red factor possessed by humanity, but
 </p>
 <p>
  for an Administrator’s ability, the applicable range was far too narrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is this inevitable due to its origin…?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Since it was an ability created by Siddhartha, the form of Blue also appeared as a golden wheel.
 </p>
 <p>
  And because he originally designed it to counter red, even if the grade increased, it could only be applied to red.
 </p>
 <p>
  But just because that was the reason it was created, accepting it here would mean,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This ability loses its potential for development.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He had become the Blue Administrator, so that couldn’t be.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recalled when he severed the red lines with Blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  Blue, which said it had reversed some of the distortions.
 </p>
 <p>
  When this power was applied, the system’s distortions were corrected.
 </p>
 <p>
  The way it was applied was by severing the distorted areas.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Severing the system’s distortions and restoring them to their original state…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Severance and restoration.
 </p>
 <p>
  Were these two aspects combined in the ability shown by Blue?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Let’s see.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan focused his thoughts on the two keywords while dodging attacks,
 </p>
 <p>
  “My, my… You’re far too agile. But your abilities have certainly improved since becoming an Administrator.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Arena Owner, who had been spewing out Void energy, gave up on chasing Seong Jihan and stood still in the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I didn’t want to use the power of the Arena, but…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Tap.
 </p>
 <p>
  He brought his hand to his top hat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I will open the space for the defeated.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He threw it towards the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, centered around the top hat, a vast expanse of violet Void energy unfolded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Construct the execution grounds.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Arena Owner mentioned the execution grounds, the Void energy soon created a stage.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Isn’t that… a guillotine?
 </p>
 <p>
  -There’s also a gallows;
 </p>
 <p>
  -This is a real execution ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Such things were hidden in that hat…
 </p>
 <p>
  The space for the defeated, the execution grounds.
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside, the Arena Owner crossed his arms,
 </p>
 <p>
  his starry eyes twinkling as he watched Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I will designate the defeated. Target, Seong Jihan. Recent defeats… 1 time. The Martial God system comes in handy at times like this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swooosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was designated as the defeated, violet beams of light rose from the execution grounds.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Bring the defeated.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When the Arena Owner pointed his finger at Seong Jihan,
 </p>
 <p>
  Bzzzzt…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The violet Void energy began rushing towards him as if to restrain a criminal.
 </p>
 <p>
  -The Arena Owner also resorts to just using Void energy when in a hurry…
 </p>
 <p>
  -I wondered why he used the top hat he always wore, turns out he had that hidden…
 </p>
 <p>
  -The Void energy is immense. To block that, it seems only the Black Sword or Total Annihilation would work…
 </p>
 <p>
  -The Red Administrator will retract the Total Annihilation, and carelessly using the Black Sword might absorb the Void energy and become a problem.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Right, if more Void energy enters the current Seong Jihan, he will crumble starting from the left side of his face…
 </p>
 <p>
  -So this is how he loses soon after becoming an Administrator…
 </p>
 <p>
  The more Void energy he absorbs, the more he crumbles.
 </p>
 <p>
  Total Annihilation cannot be used.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the eyes of the extraterrestrial viewers, Seong Jihan’s situation seemed to be a dilemma.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan drew out his spear,
 </p>
 <p>
  -Total Annihilation, it won’t work…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is he trying it just in case?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Since the Red Administrator will be focused on managing Hell, he might be aiming for this moment…
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  They thought Seong Jihan was using Total Annihilation just in case, hoping it would work.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  [You think I’ll let you use Total Annihilation?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator was on guard for this very situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  He knew that subduing Seong Jihan was more important than repairing the severed lines of Hell.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  As flames soared from Seong Jihan’s Phoenix Spear,
 </p>
 <p>
  […What?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator tried to cancel it out immediately, as if he had been waiting for it.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  the flames that rose from the spear, far from being extinguished,
 </p>
 <p>
  burned even more fiercely, incinerating the rushing violet Void energy all at once.
 </p>

 <p>
  “This is definitely Total Annihilation… Seems like you can’t control it as you please?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan sneered.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he swung the Phoenix Spear once,
 </p>
 <p>
  Total Annihilation was unleashed, severing the strands of Void energy.
 </p>
 <p>
  And outside of that red light, a faint blue glow was rising.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Blue light? Don’t tell me, your authority…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a shame I can’t use Total Annihilation as it is. So I decided to let it be used a bit more.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan then aimed the tip of his spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Phoenix Spear harbored both blue and red lights.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  The Blue ability Seong Jihan grasped was the severance and restoration of distortions.
 </p>
 <p>
  He focused first on severing.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Red Administrator canceling out Total Annihilation is also him using his authority on me… If I sever this with Blue, I can continue using Total Annihilation.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In a situation where the Taiji Sword couldn’t be used due to the Void energy,
 </p>
 <p>
  and Total Annihilation was being canceled by the Red Administrator,
 </p>
 <p>
  to break through the current situation, an authority with that level of power had to be used.
 </p>
 <p>
  In fact, it would be best if the Blue authority alone could draw out that much destructive power.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But right now, I don’t have the luxury to devise that.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to focus on what he could do for now.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Total Annihilation imbued with blue and red light continued to sever the strands of Void energy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Furthermore, as it tried to attack even the execution grounds,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mmph…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Arena Owner quickly stepped forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  From his body, flames soared up in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is quite troublesome. If there were only red, it would be absorbed…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Tap. Tap.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Arena Owner shook his body several times,
 </p>
 <p>
  but the blue-red flames did not easily die down.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Having a hard time?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, at this rate, I will be pushed back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Quickly assessing the situation upon seeing Seong Jihan’s new power, the Arena Owner replied.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I will detonate the execution grounds and pour out the Void energy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He gave up on the tactic of dragging Seong Jihan to the execution grounds,
 </p>
 <p>
  and decided to blow up the stage altogether.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Most of your Void energy will be lost then.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was going to discard the Void energy anyway.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Alright, do it.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as the Red Administrator’s order was given,
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack…
 </p>
 <p>
  The Arena’s execution grounds quickly developed cracks.
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside, a massive amount of Void energy began to rage.
 </p>
 <p>
  By causing the Void energy within the top hat to run amok, was he trying to make Seong Jihan absorb it somehow?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Tsk, I really don’t want to take it in, but they keep trying to force-feed me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the execution grounds.
 </p>
 <p>
  The stage of Void energy that was about to crumble upon the self-destruct command.
 </p>
 <p>
  The amount of Void energy that would come out from there was truly enormous,
 </p>
 <p>
  perhaps even affecting the ground below this vast sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm…’
 </p>
 <p>
  If he were to risk damage to the ground, he could just flee far away and survive.
 </p>
 <p>
  In fact, no one knew what impact the Void energy falling from this high altitude would have on humanity on earth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Running away and severing the red threads from afar with the blue-glowing golden wheel would be more advantageous in terms of gains.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I don’t think I necessarily need to avoid it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The abilities shown by Blue were the severance and restoration of distortions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here, the distortions only referred to what Red had done, but
 </p>
 <p>
  did it really need to be limited like that?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Severing distortions and restoring them to their original state, in other words… It’s an ability to nullify the opponent’s authority.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If this nullification function could be applied elsewhere as well,
 </p>
 <p>
  could it also be used on the self-destruct command utilized by the Arena Owner?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s see…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan manifested the power of Blue again.
 </p>
 <p>
  A moment ago, Blue appeared as a golden wheel.
 </p>
 <p>
  But what he needed this time was not Ashoka’s wheel.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll create it as something most suitable for me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If it was something most fitting for himself, of course it would be a weapon.
 </p>
 <p>
  Blue energy rose from his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, what are you trying to do again…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s body instantly stepped onto the stage of the execution grounds that was about to explode.

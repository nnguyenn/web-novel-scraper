  Chapter 476
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘For now, I’ll focus on severance.’𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  Swooosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The blue energy rising from Seong Jihan’s hand soon took a form.
 </p>
 <p>
  What he created was a blue longsword.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘For cutting, a sword is indeed the best.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The longsword created by condensing blue energy seemed to lack great power compared to Seong Jihan’s Eclipse or Phoenix Spear at first glance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even when the blue sword struck down on the execution grounds from his hand,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sword only sank into the stage of Void without much change.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The fuse of the explosion… is this it?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s eyes glowed blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  Until now, he could only detect the distortions of red, but
 </p>
 <p>
  it seemed that even the self-destruct command of the execution grounds fell into the category of a rather significant distortion.
 </p>
 <p>
  The violet lines were clearly visible inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s see.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan detected the line he needed to sever inside the execution grounds and,
 </p>
 <p>
  Slice!
 </p>
 <p>
  He cut it off with a single strike.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swooosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The stage of the execution grounds that had been swelling up
 </p>
 <p>
  instantly collapsed like a deflating balloon.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… You canceled the self-destruct command. The execution grounds have nothing to do with red…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Arena Owner expressed bewilderment as the Blue ability, which he thought only applied to red,
 </p>
 <p>
  caused the self-destructing execution grounds to subside.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If it’s an ability that can only be used on red, can it be called the symbolic ability of an Administrator?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan calmly responded on the surface while checking the state of the sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s different from when I cut the red lines. It consumed quite a bit of power.’
 </p>
 <p>
  When cutting the red lines, the Blue stat increased,
 </p>
 <p>
  but the Void lines consumed a considerable amount of energy in the opposite manner with a single cut.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, this wasn’t a permanent consumption to the point of reducing the stat.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It will take some time to recover to its original state.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed impossible to infinitely sever distortions like cutting through red.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Still, it’s at this level even at C-grade. When the grade rises, it will become more useful.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan pulled out the blue sword from the execution grounds,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh my… Did you figure something out? How troublesome. However,”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swooosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The entire body of the Arena Owner disappeared,
 </p>
 <p>
  and only his cosmic face remained, starting to expand greatly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Since you’ve come inside the execution grounds, I will personally greet you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Once again, strands of Void were created inside the execution grounds.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the explosion of the execution grounds was prevented, from their perspective,
 </p>
 <p>
  as long as they could blow the Void into Seong Jihan, it was a success, so they seemed to continue the same attack method.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the Void rising above the execution grounds.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This level isn’t enough to make the lines visible.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Void rising a bit from the execution grounds wasn’t a distortion that an Administrator could cut with a sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  After all, one couldn’t kill an ant with a cow-slaughtering knife.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Then I’ll just slaughter the cow.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked deeper into the execution grounds.
 </p>
 <p>
  Below where he had cut off the Void line earlier,
 </p>
 <p>
  there were 7 Void lines intersecting and extending.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The execution grounds unfolded by the top hat… That’s something that can be called a distortion.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather than the trivial Void lines rising up like that,
 </p>
 <p>
  the Arena’s execution grounds itself was something worth nullifying.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  The blue longsword grasped by Seong Jihan grew larger.
 </p>
 <p>
  Screech…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The blade of the enlarged sword touched the 7 intersecting Void lines.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike the lines he had cut before, the violet lines resisted quite a bit.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  [5 points of ‘Blue’ stat are consumed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As power was concentrated to the point of consuming the stat,
 </p>
 <p>
  Snap…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The 7 lines could no longer endure and were severed all at once.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Then, the risen Void subsided.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swooosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The Void that formed the execution grounds began to gather at a single point.
 </p>
 <p>
  What appeared there was the top hat the Arena Owner always wore.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, no…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Arena Owner was startled to see this and tried to retrieve the hat, but
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan quickly took the hat first.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I used 5 precious stat points for this.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike the red lines, the Void lines definitely had strong resistance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially since the execution grounds unfolded by this top hat had 7 lines intersecting,
 </p>
 <p>
  its durability was high, resulting in a heavy consumption of Blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no way he could hand this back to them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan held the hat like that,
 </p>
 <p>
  “G-Give that back right now…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Arena Owner revealed his urgency, speaking informally unlike his usual self.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What did you hide in here that’s making you speak informally?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who had no intention of returning it, examined the hat while sneering.
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the hat’s opening, there was a cosmic space like the Arena Owner’s face.
 </p>
 <p>
  And inside, Void energy constantly rose up.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘These Void guys really love the universe.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan looked inside the top hat with curiosity,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Black Administrator proposes to retrieve the top hat to punish the traitor, asking if it’s alright with you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A message suddenly popped up from the Black Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  No, this guy is too much.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Why didn’t you punish him until now, and you’re retrieving it only now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan asked back with a displeased face.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Black Administrator says if he had descended, Earth would have been destroyed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Black Administrator explained the reason why he couldn’t intervene until now.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Is that all?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Black, being the permanent Administrator, would naturally be strong,
 </p>
 <p>
  but does Earth get destroyed just by him coming to beat up that guy?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan…! G-Give it back!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m talking with your former boss. I’ll play with you in a bit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  While avoiding the Arena Owner who rushed at him, having lost his reason,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan asked the Black Administrator,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, fine. Let’s say Earth would have been destroyed, so you didn’t descend… Then, in exchange for retrieving this top hat, what will you give me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Black Administrator asks again if you want compensation from him.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. I want it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan immediately answered the Black Administrator’s question.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Seong Jihan is really amazing…
 </p>
 <p>
  -He’s using “Give it to me” even on the Black Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  -What kind of guts is this?
 </p>
 <p>
  -He has nothing to lose, so…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Isn’t a permanent Administrator like a superior to a temporary one…?
 </p>
 <p>
  -There’s no such thing for him.
 </p>
 <p>
  The extraterrestrial viewers showed a mixture of admiration and bewilderment upon seeing this, but
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah. Not items or anything, give it to me with Administrator authority.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was even specifying what he wanted to receive from him, regardless of their reactions.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll receive it and raise the Blue stat grade.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was too much for the stat to drop by 5 just for cutting 7 Void lines.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how he looked at it, it seemed to be because the Blue grade was only C.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since they wanted this top hat despite having an abundance of Administrator authority,
 </p>
 <p>
  he had to hand it over and receive authority.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you think?”
 </p>
 <p>
  To Seong Jihan’s proposal,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Black Administrator accepts your proposal.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [1 million Administrator authority is given.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Black Administrator immediately shot 1 million authority.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘1 million… Well, not bad.’
 </p>
 <p>
  No one else would buy the top hat the Black Administrator wanted.
 </p>
 <p>
  With 1 million authority, and the Black Administrator saying he would also take care of the Arena Owner,
 </p>
 <p>
  This much was enough to be satisfied and hand it over.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I accept the deal.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan tried to end the deal like that,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Y-You can’t hand that over…!!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Arena Owner, who had completely engulfed the atmosphere with his face, shouted loudly, but
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Swooosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  the top hat had already turned pitch-black, and the ownership had been transferred.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Oho.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the hat that floated up into the air on its own,
 </p>
 <p>
  hundreds and thousands of Void lines that he had seen earlier were drawn in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I wouldn’t be able to cut that even if I used all my stat points.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It took 5 stat points just to cut 7 lines.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how much the Blue authority could sever distortions, it was impossible to put the blade to that.
 </p>
 <p>
  As expected, one needed to be at this level to be a permanent Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan was thinking that,
 </p>
 <p>
  “R-Red Administrator. Please spare me! Didn’t I only follow you…?! Didn’t you say you would hand over Hell to me?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Arena Owner, realizing his end, was appealing to the red eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  […You’ve worked hard until now. I won’t forget your efforts.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  Leaving only those words, the Red Administrator turned his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow, what a personality…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is he mocking him by saying he worked hard? LOL
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why did the Arena Owner come out of the Void and end up like this instead of just living carefree there?
 </p>
 <p>
  -He said it’s because he didn’t want to die.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Someone at that level would have already lived for a very long time, no??
 </p>
 <p>
  -No matter how long you live, you wouldn’t want to die… You’d want to live even longer.
 </p>
 <p>
  When the human viewers heard the Red Administrator’s answer and were dumbfounded,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Y-You…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Arena Owner couldn’t finish his words and,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swooosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  He was sucked into the top hat.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That’s why you should have kept working at a good job, why did you change jobs?’
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Arena Owner and the Void were completely sucked into the top hat,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan now advanced toward the Red Administrator without any burden.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should raise the Blue grade on the way.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Having figured out the usefulness of Blue, he was disappointed that it was only C-grade.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before confronting the Red Administrator, he first raised the ability grade.
 </p>
 <p>
  [1 million Administrator authority is consumed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The grade of ‘Blue’ stat rises to A-grade.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘1 million for A-grade… It’s slowly not increasing anymore.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As the ability grade rose, the required amount of authority definitely increased.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, with the Blue grade rising from C to A, the development of the ability was clearly felt.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘With this much, I think I can test not only the severance of Blue but also the restoration…’
 </p>
 <p>
  While stroking his cracked left face like that, Seong Jihan stood in front of the red eyeball.
 </p>
 <p>
  […Blue Administrator. You are truly my opposite. An authority that nullifies change.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The red pupils flickered intensely as they looked at him.
 </p>
 <p>
  [If I escaped from the oppression of the existing system through the red authority and newly constructed the rules,]
 </p>
 <p>
  The red eyes glinting with a red light.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You protect the old system by breaking the reformed system through Blue.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan snorted upon hearing this.
 </p>
 <p>
  As if his actions were some kind of reform.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anyone who hears you would think you’re a revolutionary. Hey. You just created bugs, didn’t you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan drew the blue longsword again and aimed it at the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This sword is a means to slay bugs.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Bugs? Even after seeing this Hell system, you judge it as a mere error?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The current method of processing Void players is a wasteful act of resources. The Hell system is a more advanced processing method than the annihilation function of the Void… This is not an error but an upgrade. As an Administrator, you should also understand, right?]
 </p>
 <p>
  At those words, Seong Jihan’s eyes flashed with a blue light.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So this eyeball was Hell…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator, who attributed the afterlife of humanity and extracted energy from it.
 </p>
 <p>
  From birth to death.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meticulously operating it, the processing method itself could indeed be seen as an upgrade in some ways compared to the Void that completely deleted it.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That’s from the ruler’s perspective.’
 </p>
 <p>
  From the standpoint of those subjected to it, it was a terrible system that extracted energy even after death and further attributed them to it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan greatly enlarged the blue longsword.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re just a complicated bug. You need to be cut down immediately.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Seong Jihan. You’re an Administrator now. How long will you view the system from the perspective of the ruled?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… Until today.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The blue sword that soared high into the sky,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Only until today. I’ll view it from humanity’s perspective.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Slash!
 </p>
 <p>
  It cut the red eye in a single stroke.

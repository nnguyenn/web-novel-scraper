  Chapter 477
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack…
 </p>
 <p>
  The red eye split in half.
 </p>
 <p>
  The complex of red authority contained within it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hell’ was collapsing in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I admit… The experiment conducted on humanity has ultimately failed. The Hell connected to you has been discarded.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Twitch. Twitch.
 </p>
 <p>
  The eye, cut in half with most of its power gone, moved feebly and spoke to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  [But this failure was not in vain. I have already successfully transmitted the construction data of Hell.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Transmitting data even when split in half like this?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan furrowed his brows.
 </p>
 <p>
  “When did you send it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [From the moment you took care of the Arena Owner for me.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Took care of? Your tone makes it seem like you wanted him dead.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [One owner of Hell is sufficient…]
 </p>
 <p>
  This bastard, he had no intention of handing over Hell at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  No wonder he didn’t seem to actively help the Arena Owner.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Taking this failure as a lesson, I will successfully complete the next experiment… Rejoice in peace, at least for a while. My failed creation.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can’t you just die forever now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Slash!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan cut the halved eye several times, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Haha… Even a mere beast doesn’t dig only one den…]
 </p>
 <p>
  The red eye, even while being shredded to dust, left such a will and disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, what a nasty bastard.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Where the hell did he hide that red eyeball again?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought about searching the universe to find him, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No, the rest is up to the permanent Administrators.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He decided to leave the universal search task to the higher-ups.
 </p>
 <p>
  Honestly, just finding Hell was enough to say he did his job, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan was thinking that,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The 1st-grade system distortion of red, ‘Hell’, has been eliminated.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Blue stat increases by 100.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The reward for eliminating Hell came in.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This makes Blue 205.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was quite a headache-inducing enemy, but the reward was also tremendous.
 </p>
 <p>
  With this battle, the grade of Blue rose to A, and the stat also increased drastically.
 </p>
 <p>
  For Seong Jihan, it was a battle where he gained quite a lot.
 </p>
 <p>
  And,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘After destroying Hell, there’s a considerable amount of red energy remaining in the debris…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The red energy that would slowly disperse into the atmosphere if left like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a shame to just let this go as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although it was the ability of the Red Administrator, the opposite of Blue,
 </p>
 <p>
  it still had its uses until now.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s absorb it with the sacred flame.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  As white flames rose from Seong Jihan’s palm, the red energy scattered around began to gather there.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Red stat increases by 2.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Red stat increases by 5.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red stat, which steadily increased through the sacred flame, finally reached 255.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A difference of 50 from Blue.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though he was the Blue Administrator, why was the Red stat still higher?
 </p>
 <p>
  After organizing the harvest of this time like that, Seong Jihan,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well then, let’s see if the hidden abilities have disappeared.’
 </p>
 <p>
  opened the management item ‘Humanity’ and looked at the hidden ability section.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Red Factor’ and the ?? Hellbound From Hell.
 </p>
 <p>
  The two hidden abilities had both disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Does this mean they’ve become an ordinary species now…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s not easy to be ordinary either.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan was thinking that and examining humanity’s abilities,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Huh? This wasn’t there before…’
 </p>
 <p>
  At the very bottom of the management item Humanity, a new text was added and shimmering.
 </p>
 <p>
  Wondering what it was, Seong Jihan scrolled down, and there,
 </p>
 <p>
  [BattleNet Withdrawal Possible]
 </p>
 <p>
  was displayed.
 </p>

 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile,
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh… Looks like we’ll live lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -I knew Seong Jihan-nim would do it.
 </p>
 <p>
  -As expected, I believed in him…!!
 </p>
 <p>
  -Look at those bastards who were complaining to Seong Jihan-nim about why he removed the Red Factor quickly changing their stance
 </p>
 <p>
  -Hahaaha This is humanity for you.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Hell was destroyed and the rapidly draining life force returned,
 </p>
 <p>
  the attitudes of the human viewers had already turned 180 degrees.
 </p>
 <p>
  The people who were protesting to Seong Jihan just a moment ago about why he removed the Red Factor and made them die
 </p>
 <p>
  were now praising Seong Jihan even more strongly as if such a thing never happened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Everyone, the hidden abilities have disappeared, but a new item has been added.”
 </p>
 <p>
  -What else has been added to humanity?
 </p>
 <p>
  -No matter how much you dig, something keeps coming out of this species…
 </p>
 <p>
  -That’s why I want to kidnap one and experiment on it…
 </p>
 <p>
  -No merchandise available in the market?
 </p>
 <p>
  -They still belong to the Bronze League, so it’s illegal.
 </p>
 <p>
  To Seong Jihan’s words, the extraterrestrials who were wondering what the hell this species called humanity was and wanted to perform human experiments on them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fortunately, they belonged to the Bronze League in this case.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to clear up the misunderstanding of the extraterrestrials.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What was added this time is not a special ability that only applies to humanity. It’s this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When he showed the [BattleNet Withdrawal Possible] item in the management item Humanity window,
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh. Withdrawal…
 </p>
 <p>
  -We can escape from BattleNet??
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow, amazing
 </p>
 <p>
  -Can we go back to the old days without battles…?
 </p>
 <p>
  An explosive reaction came from the human viewers.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, of course, it’s not possible right now. It requires quite a lot of Administrator authority.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan said that and brought his finger to the shimmering text,
 </p>
 <p>
  [1 billion Administrator authority is required for immediate withdrawal.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [After the end of this season, 10 million Administrator authority is required for withdrawal.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [A species whose reason for being invited to BattleNet has disappeared.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Upon withdrawing from BattleNet, the withdrawal is permanent.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Various information related to BattleNet withdrawal popped up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Immediate withdrawal is impossible, and as for withdrawal after the end of the season… I can’t guarantee it, to be honest.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Administrator authority he received was all used to strengthen the Blue stat.
 </p>
 <p>
  The season might already end before he could gather 10 million authority.
 </p>
 <p>
  No, perhaps achieving the original withdrawal condition,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘3 wins in the Space League’, might be faster.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still,
 </p>
 <p>
  “If we leave this time, we won’t get involved with BattleNet anymore.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The species that receive an invitation to BattleNet are those with a factor that can live ‘eternally’, was it?
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Factor and Hellbound From Hell, which were humanity’s hidden abilities, went beyond eternal life.
 </p>
 <p>
  They had the potential for a single being to aim for even the position of a permanent Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now that they’re gone, withdrawing this time means they won’t receive an invitation anymore.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So this is how we can enjoy freedom.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Removing the Red Factor was really the right decision.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan was thinking that this was the greatest achievement of today,
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ooh… Amazing…!
 </p>
 <p>
  -Then the fear of dungeon portals will disappear, and we won’t have to watch this crazy battle game…!
 </p>
 <p>
  -But there hasn’t been much fear of dungeon portals lately, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  -More people die from mosquitoes these days lolol
 </p>
 <p>
  -It’s a bit unfortunate not being able to watch BattleNet matches… Can’t watch BattleTube either.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Hey, it’s fine now because we’re doing well, but what if we get into the relegation zone? Will you be so carefree then? ㅡㅡ’
 </p>
 <p>
  -But our backer is Seong Jihan…
 </p>
 <p>
  People’s reactions were more divided than expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  And,
 </p>
 <p>
  -?? Why leave BattleNet?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Weren’t they the lowest-ranked species? Do they want to go back to that time?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Huh? Go back?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yeah, if you withdraw from BattleNet, you have to spit out all the benefits you received from there.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the extraterrestrial chat window, the majority opinion was why bother withdrawing.
 </p>
 <p>
  -When the Administrator is protecting them like that, I would stick around here if I were them.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Seong Jihan-nim, can’t you just make humanity withdraw and come to us? Our Aljur species is quite similar to humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Aljur, don’t you guys have 7 horns and 11 eyes… How is that similar to humanity?
 </p>
 <p>
  -We also walk on two legs like them? We only have two arms and legs? Our bodies are only 3 times larger?
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  -He’s bragging…
 </p>
 <p>
  Starting with the Aljur tribe’s proposal,
 </p>
 <p>
  appeals from extraterrestrial species telling him to make humanity withdraw and come to them poured out.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  -What… What is this? The race bonus disappears?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Where do you give and take back?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Does this mean the life expectancy of 200 years disappears?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is 200 years the problem? Will we get sick a lot like before?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ah, I don’t want that… The stamina stat is so good;nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh, the stock prices of pharmaceutical companies that were ruined are rising in real-time lolol
 </p>
 <p>
  -Really? Mine was -90% keke
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ah, I just want to live like now without taking medicine.
 </p>
 <p>
  After obtaining information from the extraterrestrial chat window, the opposition among human viewers grew.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan opened his eyes wide seeing these reactions.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was a reaction he couldn’t have imagined in his previous life.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the hellish days when only the final 10 nations remained and the whole world was covered in dungeon portals,
 </p>
 <p>
  whenever they lost in a Bronze League match, humanity fell into despair.
 </p>
 <p>
  Back then, everyone’s wish was to escape BattleNet…
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, everyone. You saw the humanity extinction scenario last time, right? A world where all but the final 10 nations were destroyed. A species that gets deleted upon relegation… BattleNet isn’t such a good place.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan spoke up, unable to bear people’s reactions, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  -But we have Seong Jihan-nim.
 </p>
 <p>
  -The Administrator will take care of everything!!
 </p>
 <p>
  -Let’s quickly adopt Seong Jihanism as the state religion.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Really, which religion has doubled lifespan and made the body healthy so far?
 </p>
 <p>
  -When my mom collapsed and woke up last time, I already accepted Seong Jihan-nim as my god.
 </p>
 <p>
  -There’s already a Seong Jihan shrine in Japan. It’s a must-visit spot for Korean tourists lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -No, we can’t let them take it. What the hell is the government doing?
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather, only testimonies of faith were increasing.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…These people, really.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With species evolution and whatnot, humans have received too many benefits from BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  They don’t know how scary BattleNet was.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, the era of destruction won’t come as it did then during the period I manage, but…’
 </p>
 <p>
  If they continued like that, all the religious facilities on Earth would really turn into places that upheld Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I don’t really like that.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan furrowed his brows.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he was upheld and served as a god, it seemed he would really spend his life taking care of only humanity until he died.
 </p>
 <p>
  He’d rather not.
 </p>
 <p>
  He looked at the overheated chat window and,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Let’s go home for now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  decided to return home instead of staying in the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Everyone, regarding BattleNet withdrawal, I will broadcast again later as I obtain accurate information. Let’s end BattleTube here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Beep.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although BattleTube was turned off like that,
 </p>
 <p>
  -I’m telling you, staying is the right choice.
 </p>
 <p>
  -No, then are you saying we should play this crazy battle game for life?
 </p>
 <p>
  -You don’t want to live until 200?
 </p>
 <p>
  -What if it goes like the humanity extinction scenario last time?
 </p>
 <p>
  -You don’t trust Seong Jihan-nim?
 </p>
 <p>
  -No, but being safe is the best…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The ‘BattleNet withdrawal’ brought up by Seong Jihan was instantly dominating the topic among humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, in a hotel room in Incheon,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Tsk tsk… Why is that bastard Seong Jihan mentioning BattleNet withdrawal himself?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The old man Gilgamesh, who was watching this broadcast, clicked his tongue.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Red Factor, Hell… If he removed all these things, he should start dominating in earnest now. Aren’t all the people asking to become our god? But why is he bringing up the withdrawal story himself? I really don’t understand. How foolish. Don’t you think so, Pythia?”
 </p>
 <p>
  […If he had any intention of becoming a ruler, he would have already joined hands with the Red Administrator. He has no intention of dominating humanity.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s what’s so frustrating. If he’s not going to dominate, why is he using his power like that? I don’t get it. Tsk tsk.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Gilgamesh’s words, Pythia’s divine eyes sparkled.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Removing the Red Factor was my lifelong aspiration. I prayed for the Martial God to do it, but the one who actually accomplished it was Seong Jihan…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Factor, which she had no clue how to remove.
 </p>
 <p>
  But Seong Jihan cleanly finished this task by granting the Blue stat to all of humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God only said he would do it, not even showing a hint of what method he would use.
 </p>
 <p>
  From the unexpected Seong Jihan’s side, he finished it in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Then. The only remaining Red Factor on this Earth is.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The divine eye wriggled and stared at Gilgamesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Only this bastard.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The starting point that spread the Red Factor to humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking at Gilgamesh, who was now called ‘Adam’,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia’s eyes emitted a murderous light.

  Chapter 478
 </p>
 <p>
  BattleNet withdrawal.
 </p>
 <p>
  This topic, which emerged after Seong Jihan destroyed Hell,
 </p>
 <p>
  continued to be discussed even after the broadcast ended.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Losses suffered by humanity after entering BattleNet]
 </p>
 <p>
  -Population decrease due to dungeon portals (estimated 10~20 percent)
 </p>
 <p>
  -Destroyed nations (ex: North Korea)
 </p>
 <p>
  -Logistics damage due to dungeon portal occupation.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Increase in youth violence due to harmful battle games forcibly occupying broadcast channels.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Emergence of class divisions and widening gaps between players and non-players.
 </p>
 <p>
  The negative impacts of BattleNet on peaceful human society are countless.
 </p>
 <p>
  Would you give up a peaceful daily life for the sake of species evolution?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yeah, I can live 100 more years~
 </p>
 <p>
  -The author of this post is also broadcasting through BattleTube lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -Honestly, if Seong Jihan-nim wasn’t the Administrator, I would also cast a vote for withdrawal, but now that we can reap the benefits, why should we leave?
 </p>
 <p>
  -We should trust in our Administrator’s backing and keep evolving;
 </p>
 <p>
  Many debates related to this took place in BattleNet-related communities, but the overall trend of public opinion was leaning towards staying in BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  The world of the tutorial period before Seong Jihan’s appearance definitely made people feel a sense of crisis, but
 </p>
 <p>
  Since his active role, humanity was able to directly experience the positive aspects of BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  The benefits brought by Seong Jihan were across various aspects, but
 </p>
 <p>
  The most tangible one for the general public was indeed health improvement.
 </p>
 <p>
  To the extent that life expectancy was predicted to nearly double and the medical and pharmaceutical industries were faltering,
 </p>
 <p>
  The impact of species evolution on society was considerable.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Most people want to stay in BattleNet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. The majority, no, the public opinion of all countries is in favor of staying in BattleNet. The support for Seong Jihan is overwhelming.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In the underground conference room of the Robert Gates Building in the United States,
 </p>
 <p>
  The leaders of the companies leading the Gates Group had all gathered to hold an emergency meeting regarding this BattleNet withdrawal.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I would also support him. After being in a wheelchair, I can walk now, and I feel like dancing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is there anyone here who hasn’t benefited from Seong’s grace? Everyone looks 10 or 20 years younger.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No matter how advanced medical technology is, it couldn’t turn back time. It only prevented aging.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, that’s why our bio company’s stock price plummeted… But personally, I’m satisfied. We’ll live and see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The leaders of the Gates family, who had thoroughly enjoyed the benefits of species evolution.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even the business owner whose pharmaceutical company was shattered welcomed the life extension effect with both hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  The effects of species evolution were given equally to everyone regardless of wealth,
 </p>
 <p>
  but unlike the poor without wealth, the wealthy who only lacked health felt the benefits of this species evolution more thoroughly.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, there was also a downside for these capitalists.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The shaking of the existing system by BattleNet is a red flag.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The influence of players is expanding day by day.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right. Compared to the tutorial period, the power they can use in the real world has become stronger.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “In countries with poor public order, it’s not uncommon to find players reigning like kings.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now we can hire them with money, but…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “As time goes by, the power will shift from capital to players.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Players, whose influence had grown since BattleNet entered the main game.
 </p>
 <p>
  They had power, gained public influence through BattleTube, and held considerable wealth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even in the case of the United States, the operating funds for the No. 1 guild American First were provided by the Gates family,
 </p>
 <p>
  but the actual power was gradually being taken by the affiliated players.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If humanity continues to stay in BattleNet, the power structure will be shaken by the random ‘gifts’.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The wealth of the Gates family may also become subordinate to players.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “In fact, isn’t Barren from American First showing such signs? That bastard keeps coveting real power.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t even mention it. Why is that young punk so greedy…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Life extension is good, but it’s not desirable for this system to continue…”
 </p>
 <p>
  For those in power, nothing was more threatening than their power being shaken.
 </p>

 <p>
  The members of the Gates family enjoyed the effects of evolution but had negative thoughts about staying in BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We need to change the trend of public opinion.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We should widely publicize the negative aspects of staying in BattleNet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm. The effects of species evolution are so outstanding that it doesn’t seem easy to sway public opinion…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How about this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Robert Gates, who attended the meeting, spoke while looking around at the attendees.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We turn public opinion towards BattleNet withdrawal and at the same time ask Seong Jihan to come up with a solution.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What do you mean by that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We ask him to find a way to maintain the effects of evolution while withdrawing from BattleNet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, that would be ideal, but…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Will things go as we wish?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He is an Administrator and someone who destroyed Hell. Wouldn’t there be a way?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Will that be possible?
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking at the family members who had doubts, Robert Gates grinned.
 </p>
 <p>
  “As always. Let’s ‘ask him to do it’ this time too. Let’s not openly take the lead, but hide behind the back of public opinion…”

 <p>
  A few days later.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There are a lot of articles like this these days…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What articles?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, who was sitting on the sofa, showed the screen in response to Seong Jihan’s question.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Articles related to incidents caused by players.”
 </p>
 <p>
  On the news screen Yoon Seah was watching, several articles were posted about players causing accidents and incidents, calling them the light and shadow of BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They committed all sorts of crimes, from serial killers to kidnapping and drug trafficking.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not easy for the authorities to crack down on players anyway.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right. Our country has good public order, so it’s fine, but countries with poor order are in chaos…”
 </p>
 <p>
  While scrolling down like that, Yoon Seah said,
 </p>
 <p>
  “But these articles seem to have surged after you mentioned BattleNet withdrawal.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. If even I, who only occasionally watch the news, can feel it, wouldn’t people feel it more?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, when she opened the comment section of the news,
 </p>
 <p>
  The comment with the most likes caught her eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Players are quite problematic… Can’t we maintain the effects of evolution while withdrawing from BattleNet?
 </p>
 <p>
  └ Seong Jihan-nim will do it for us.
 </p>
 <p>
  └ But Seong Jihan is also a player?
 </p>
 <p>
  └ He’s an Administrator, so there must be a way!
 </p>
 <p>
  └ This time too, ‘Do it for us.’
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Why do they keep asking him to do it for them? They’re so greedy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the reactions asking Seong Jihan to solve it, Yoon Seah frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They want to keep the evolution bonus while withdrawing from BattleNet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Calling players problematic. That’s too much. Well… It wouldn’t be a complete lie to say there are none. But these days, only articles like this are coming out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking at the articles about players causing problems, Seong Jihan thought,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It was even more lawless in the past.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In his previous life, due to the dungeon portals, players were practically nobles.
 </p>
 <p>
  Later on, they could easily avoid legal punishment even after committing murder.
 </p>
 <p>
  Recalling the world back then, it’s heaven now, but
 </p>
 <p>
  the gap between players and non-players would be the same as then.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There are many players who do good deeds… Really.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing her pouting her lips, Seong Jihan said,
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you want to do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. Now that I’ve become an Administrator, you’re the undisputed No. 1 player. You could be called the top vested interest from the players’ side.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, what vested interest… No. Well, am I?”

 <p>
  Yoon Seah said while scratching her cheek,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m a bit disappointed, but I think it’s better to leave than to be involved with BattleNet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really? Because players are problematic?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No. Rather than because of these problems… If we accidentally slip up, a lot of people might die fighting the opponents you face.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ve been lucky so far.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right. Like when the Tower of Babel appeared in the middle of Seolleung. And last time with Hell too. The scale is different when accidents happen in BattleNet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although they had been fortunate enough to prevent accidents from happening so far,
 </p>
 <p>
  This luck couldn’t continue forever.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before something happens later on, it would be better for humanity to cut ties with BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can’t keep cleaning up after them forever either.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan firmly believed that humanity should withdraw from BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Still. They shouldn’t ask you to do it like this. They want to sneak out with the evolution bonus… Isn’t this impossible?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm, wait a moment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Yoon Seah’s words, Seong Jihan opened the humanity management item and asked the system,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can humanity’s current abilities be maintained even after withdrawing from BattleNet?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It can be maintained if ‘Permanent Ability Preservation’ is activated.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “How much authority does it require?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [When permanently preserving all abilities, 100 million will be consumed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…100 million? Why so much?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The growth range of the species ‘Humanity’ is large, and it is receiving attention from all Administrators, so more Administrator authority is needed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Even after destroying Hell and chasing away the Red Administrator, they’re still paying attention.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This time, the Blue stat grade was upgraded, so the authority is barely converted to +100 per day…’
 </p>
 <p>
  When Blue was FFF-grade, the authority was drained by -50 per day due to distortions in other stats.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Blue rose to A-grade, the amount of authority acquired also increased together.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, the Administrator authority accumulated by +100 each day.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, to obtain 100 million authority, it would take a million days at this rate.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Of course, if I give up on all other stats, the amount of authority gained will increase… But there’s no need to overdo it like that.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If there was an abundance of authority, it would be a different story.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had no intention of sacrificing that much for humanity when it was already burdensome to raise Blue.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  “At the current rate, it takes 1 million days to catch both rabbits.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “1 million days… Oh. I punched it into the calculator, and it’s 2739 years?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. It’s basically telling us not to even dream about it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right…”
 </p>
 <p>
  While Yoon Seah was agreeing that it seemed impossible at Seong Jihan’s words,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Jihan, Sophia is here to see you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jiah approached while floating and spoke to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sophia? It’s been a while.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, Sophia said she was going to the US to see her parents… She must have returned today.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Yoon Seah got up from the sofa with a delighted expression,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jiah spoke in a subdued voice,
 </p>
 <p>
  [But… It seems Sophia. She’s not her original self.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you mean by that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I sense the divine eye in her.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jiah raised her eyes of light like that,
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Step. Step.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia entered the house with a serious face unlike her usual self.
 </p>
 <p>
  On her forehead, the divine eye similar to what Seong Jiah had raised were flickering.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I borrowed her body for a moment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Among humans, there were only two beings with divine eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at those eyes of light with a subdued eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…You. Are you Pythia?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. I have something to tell you.”

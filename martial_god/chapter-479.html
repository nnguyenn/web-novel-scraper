  Chapter 479
 </p>
 <p>
  “Something to say… What is it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Before that, I want to ask about your intentions first.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “My intentions?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan tilted his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  After going through the trouble of possessing Sophia’s body, the first thing she asked about was his intentions?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Why you became the Blue Administrator and what you plan to do from now on.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Asking for a lot of information despite occupying Sophia’s body.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m only temporarily connected to her due to our past ties. I can’t stay in her body for long. You don’t need to worry about that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia spoke softly with a face quite different from when she was the Martial God’s loyal disciple.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at her closely.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia’s current possessed state.
 </p>
 <p>
  Could it be reversed with Blue stat?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm… This level of distortion is too weak to even be called one.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia’s power was so weak that it would disappear in less than an hour.
 </p>
 <p>
  With this level, it was ambiguous to even break the distortion.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to have a conversation with her for now.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why did I become the Blue Administrator?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It was better than picking either red or green. And the Benefactor of Life left such a will too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Benefactor of Life… You mean Ashoka?”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s words, Pythia asked back.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, I have to repay my debts.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I see. You gave up the path to becoming a Permanent Administrator and repaid your debt of life.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, in the first place… If I had chosen red, I would have just become a host for the Red Administrator, and if I had become green, I would have been subordinated to Yggdrasil. There was no choice.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, if you had even a little ambition to become a Permanent Administrator, you wouldn’t have made such a choice.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Permanent Administrator? What’s the point of becoming that? It would just be bothersome.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Permanent… You said it’s bothersome?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia’s eyes widened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I didn’t expect you to assess the position of a Permanent Administrator like that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t it obviously bothersome to manage BattleNet for life without being able to die?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…You have surprisingly little ambition. But how did you come this far to become a temporary Administrator?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Because of your master and the Red Administrator. I have to live, don’t I?”
 </p>
 <p>
  That Martial God bastard kept trying to reset this world.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the Red Administrator was trying to become a transcendent being through humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  He only came this far resisting them.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You came this far for survival. But for someone who wants to live so much, your face is in a terrible state.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Tap. Tap.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan tapped his left face, Pythia nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, if you leave that, you won’t live for even a year.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A, a year…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right. The reason you put on that Void despite knowing its danger… It’s because the one you need to save is not you, but her, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia then looked at Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jiah quickly stepped forward and hid her behind his back.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh my. I was just looking. In the first place, I have no special connection with her, so I can’t possess her.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s better to be careful of anything.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really… You’re too much for a fellow divine eye owner.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia smiled and looked at Seong Jihan again.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, what’s your answer to my question?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, isn’t it natural to try to save one’s family?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so? There aren’t many people around me who do such obvious things. Especially cases where they try to save someone while gnawing at their own lifeline.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle, is that really true… That face…”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Yoon Seah’s worried words, Seong Jihan answered nonchalantly,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll remove this with the Administrator’s ability, so it’s fine.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “T-That’s possible?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. I think it’s possible.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the functions of Blue stat, severance had already borne some fruit.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, if he developed the restoration function to return things to their original state, he could find a clue to solving this Void fracture.
 </p>
 <p>
  If there was a way to live, there was no need to die unnecessarily.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll just cut off that Martial God bastard’s head and live well on my own, so don’t worry.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Cut off my lord’s head…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even at the mention of cutting off his head, Pythia showed little reaction.
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering her past loyalty to the Martial God, it was a puzzling attitude.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan was looking at her closely,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll help with that too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ll help in fighting the Martial God…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. To be exact,”
 </p>
 <p>
  Tap. Tap.

 <p>
  Pythia pointed to her forehead.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll give you the divine eye. To you.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “…What’s with the change of heart?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Change of heart? This was my original purpose for coming here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your purpose was to give me the eyes?”𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. And not just that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash.
 </p>
 <p>
  As light flickered in the divine eye,
 </p>
 <p>
  the image of the old man Gilgamesh looking at the sea was reflected.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was going to tell you Gilgamesh’s location too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I can’t help but be suspicious. Why are you, who was more loyal to the Martial God than anyone, suddenly…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Because you achieved the reason I pledged loyalty to him.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When did he?
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan looked at her with puzzled eyes,
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia smiled slightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You removed the Red Factor from humanity. You did.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Removing the Red Factor was the reason for your loyalty?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. It was all because of that factor that my children were burned by the Blood clan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As she said that, Pythia’s eyes sank.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Martial God said he would do it someday, so I believed and pledged my loyalty… But you did it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Because of that, your attitude changed and you’re even giving me the eye? I can’t easily believe it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if removing the Red Factor was her lifelong wish,
 </p>
 <p>
  it was not easy to understand her saying she would hand over the divine eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan did not let go of his suspicion, Pythia shrugged.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Actually, I was just going to tell you Gilgamesh’s location. Although he has lost his reproductive ability now, that bastard can become a seed that spreads the Red Factor again. I wanted you to eliminate him.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry about that. From my perspective, Gilgamesh is also someone I need to eliminate.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. But… When I thought about dying, I became curious about your thoughts. Why did you become the Blue Administrator? What will you do with that power from now on?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So that’s why you asked those questions earlier.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s your impression after hearing it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia smiled and raised the corners of her mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… You came this far for a more mundane reason than I thought? You became an Administrator just to save one person.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wh-What’s mundane about that!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Yoon Seah flared up, Pythia’s smile deepened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “And despite becoming an Administrator, you have no ambition. It’s enough to make the constellations who strive to become transcendent beings feel deflated.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “While evaluating like that, you’re still willing to give me the divine eye.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s why.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She answered brightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m tired of those overflowing with ambition. Since I was human.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You may also develop greed over time and try to reign as an Administrator… But you’re still better than those who are already like that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Already like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God or Gilgamesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  No, was she referring to both of them?
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan quietly looked at the divine eye, she said,
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Martial God’s power is mighty, so even if I give you the divine eye, it won’t be of much help. It will still be difficult for you to subdue him.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even though I’ve become an Administrator?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. The power he has accumulated is endless, so he will still overwhelm you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God, who had gathered and accumulated power to become a Permanent Administrator in one go.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how much Seong Jihan became a temporary Administrator and developed Blue,
 </p>
 <p>
  if you only consider the total amount of power, he would have the upper hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Still… With my divine eye, you will be able to interfere with his future vision.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your eyes play that much of a role?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Because even the divine eye summoned by the Martial God are based on mine.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At those words, Seong Jihan furrowed his brows.
 </p>
 <p>
  That Martial God bastard.
 </p>
 <p>
  He exploited Dongbang Sak’s ability to use Martial Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  Were the divine eye the same?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Isn’t this guy’s real ability parasitizing on others’ powers? To this extent?’
 </p>
 <p>
  He really wanted to take away the Martial God title from that Martial God bastard soon.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan was thinking that,
 </p>
 <p>
  “You seem to be in a dilemma. Well, it’s natural not to trust me. Then,”
 </p>
 <p>
  Zing…
 </p>
 <p>
  As light emanated from the divine eye,
 </p>
 <p>
  […Pythia. Isn’t it about time you showed your usefulness? At this rate, I will be able to specify the location of the World Tree.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A voice began to be heard from Gilgamesh, who was looking at the sea.
 </p>
 <p>
  Was he trying to find the World Tree in the West Sea?
 </p>
 <p>
  He’s really persistent too.

 <p>
  “Wouldn’t it be better to deal with him first?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded at Pythia’s suggestion.
 </p>
 <p>
  He could think more about obtaining the divine eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. Where exactly is the location?”
 </p>
 <p>
  For now, he decided to deal with Gilgamesh first.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Above the Martial God’s star, Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the part above the sky where the constellation’s relics were located,
 </p>
 <p>
  There was a brilliant light shining brightly enough to illuminate even Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  […Now all the power has gathered.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The identity of the light was the Sun King.
 </p>
 <p>
  Defeated by Dongbang Sak, he had mobilized all his power
 </p>
 <p>
  and finished preparing to invade Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s just that Tuseong was sealed for three months as punishment from the Administrator, so he couldn’t invade.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The three-month seal. It turned out well. I was able to gather power.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The power of the Sun King, which had spread throughout BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  It took quite a lot of time even for him to gather it all together.
 </p>
 <p>
  The three months Tuseong was sealed was utilized as a preparation period for him to gather his full strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  [When the seal is released, that monster will come to stop me again…]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sun King recalled the Cosmic Demon who had subdued him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although he was incomplete at that time, he was sliced by the Cosmic Demon without being able to put up much of a fight.
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, he had drawn all his power, but considering the strength of the Cosmic Demon, the same result as before might come out again.
 </p>
 <p>
  [There’s no need to fight him…]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sun King decided to avoid a battle with the Cosmic Demon, who possessed immeasurable power.
 </p>
 <p>
  In any case, his goal was to take possession of the Martial God’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was enough to just activate the stigma engraved on his 17,777th son.
 </p>
 <p>
  The important thing was to somehow enter Tuseong and make contact with him.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. If I take possession of the Martial God’s body, I will be able to make even that mighty Cosmic Demon my subordinate…]
 </p>
 <p>
  So there’s no need to fight him.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sun King made such a strategy and,
 </p>
 <p>
  Scattered the gathered light widely to surround Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how strong the Cosmic Demon was, he wouldn’t be able to block all directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  He would attack from all sides at once and take possession of the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sun King finished his invasion preparations like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then the only thing left to do was to wait until the seal was released.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should check if there’s anything unusual outside.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sun King turned on BattleTube.
 </p>
 <p>
  In that world where numerous channels were rampant,
 </p>
 <p>
  There was a video that drew incomparably unique attention.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He uploads videos even after becoming an Administrator.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, the Blue Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even after reaching the position of an Administrator, he was uploading videos on his BattleTube channel.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was absurd for such a classless bastard to become an Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  While feeling the absurdity, the Sun King played the video.
 </p>
 <p>
  And,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Red Administrator… He even won over the Arena Owner.’
 </p>
 <p>
  While interestingly examining the characters appearing in the video,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That’s…’
 </p>
 <p>
  A red eye appeared on the screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  As it formed ‘Hell’, he only stared at it as if enchanted.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Haha… Even a mere beast doesn’t dig only one den…]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Red Administrator left such a will to Seong Jihan before dying,
 </p>
 <p>
  Twitch.
 </p>
 <p>
  Changes began to occur within the Sun King’s light mass.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ugh… T-This is…]
 </p>
 <p>
  What emerged from the light mass was a giant made of pure white light.
 </p>
 <p>
  It closely resembled the appearance of the giant he had fought against Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  And from all over his body,
 </p>
 <p>
  Plop. Plop.
 </p>
 <p>
  Red eyes began to pop out one by one.
 </p>
 <p>
  [M-Master… Since when…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sun King tried to resist this somehow while looking at his rapidly changing body, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Since when, you ask? Why do you think I took on disciples?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [T-That’s…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [It was all to use at times like this.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Poof! Poof!
 </p>
 <p>
  The giant of white light instantly turned red.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  The light surrounding Tuseong also changed to the same color.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’re quite useful, my disciple.]
 </p>
 <p>
  And the Red Administrator, who had taken possession of his former disciple’s ‘body’,
 </p>
 <p>
  looked at Tuseong and said with delight,
 </p>
 <p>
  [But there’s something even more useful over there…]

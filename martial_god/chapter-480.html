  Chapter 480
 </p>
 <p>
  Late night at the Incheon coastline.
 </p>
 <p>
  Standing in a secluded spot, Gilgamesh looked beyond the sea, a smile forming at his lips.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, the World Tree was indeed in the sea.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes, but it’s quite a distance from here. Can you make it?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even though I have weakened… crossing the sea is not an issue. More importantly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh looked at the back of his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  A desiccated, wrinkled hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  It showed that his aging had progressed further.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Before I age any more, I need to draw life energy from the World Tree.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Right.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your response is lukewarm. You need life energy too; that should free you from that eyeball form, shouldn’t it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Because I don’t think you’ll give it to me. Didn’t you plan to discard me after using me?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Haha. How could I treat my first wife so harshly?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh’s lips curved upwards as he looked at the divine eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you sincerely cooperate this time, I will share some life energy with you. As the King of Humans, I promise.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [So if I help, you’ll just let me live?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Haha. There will be a small restriction. But it’s nothing too significant, so don’t worry.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh’s smile deepened as he mentioned the small restriction.
 </p>
 <p>
  […Fine. Let’s go.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Following the light guided by the divine eye, Gilgamesh began running across the sea.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how much his strength had dwindled, the power he had amassed up to an 8th-level constellation remained.
 </p>
 <p>
  He soon reached his intended destination.
 </p>
 <p>
  [From here, you must go to the bottom of the sea.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Indeed. I can sense it now…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh’s eyes glowed as he gazed into the sea.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once he absorbed life energy from the World Tree, which was sealed there, he could halt this aging.
 </p>
 <p>
  Quickly diving into the water, he reached the place where the World Tree was sealed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Standing on the seabed, he noticed the seal.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is the seal formation.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Most of the complex patterns had disappeared due to Seong Jihan’s interference.
 </p>
 <p>
  Only the red dot at the center and several connecting lines of the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams formation remained.
 </p>
 <p>
  The shape itself was simple enough to seem easy to dismantle.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But the power contained within it is immensely strong.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssshhh.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Gilgamesh moved his hand underwater, a barrier formed around his body.
 </p>
 <p>
  The barrier repelled the seawater, making conversation possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Pythia, do you hear me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  He spoke as he looked at the divine eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  [What is it?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “That seal formation, it’s not easy to dismantle. Do you see anything with your divine eye?”
 </p>
 <p>
  […Hmm. It seems you shouldn’t touch the center. The rest, I can’t quite figure out.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Tch, even the divine eye isn’t helpful.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Clicking his tongue, Gilgamesh scrutinized the seal formation underwater.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had come all this way, but this was a problem.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The World Tree is surely inside the formation…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the strong seal, life energy was faintly leaking from the red dot.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it were fully released and the World Tree revealed itself,
 </p>
 <p>
  he could not only stop aging but also return to his youthful days.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Aren’t you going to do anything?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait… This is precious life we’ve barely held onto. I can’t risk it here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [So you can’t break the seal.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re really noisy! I’m merely lacking power at the moment. Hmm. Hold on… But…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh grimaced as if struck by an idea and walked over to the seal formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come to think of it, there’s no need to dangerously dismantle the seal.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […Why not?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even by just absorbing the life energy leaking from here, I can slowly regain my former strength.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It seems like it will take decades, no, even centuries to regain your former power with that…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmph, what’s a few centuries?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh sneered at Pythia’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I am someone who has lived since the beginning of time. I can wait that long.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […]
 </p>
 <p>
  “While absorbing the life energy here, I will wait for Seong Jihan to collapse on his own.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He then looked down at the divine eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, this is where we part ways.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [So there’s no life energy for me?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. If I had enough power, I would’ve inscribed the domination code on your body. But there’s no room for that now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [As I thought…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia responded indifferently, as if she expected nothing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssssshhh.
 </p>
 <p>
  She turned away from Gilgamesh, looking towards the side.

 <p>
  [Am I right? There’s nothing in this guy for me anymore.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Who, who are you talking to?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh nervously turned and looked to the side.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There you are. Just as I thought.”
 </p>
 <p>
  There stood Seong Jihan, calmly crossing his arms.

 </p>
 <p>
  Why was Seong Jihan here?
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh widened his eyes before quickly coming to a conclusion.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You, you… You betrayed me?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You and I were never in a relationship that valued loyalty.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “This mad…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Krrrr.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh clenched his fist, trying to crush the divine eye,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Whoa.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan moved his hand, Gilgamesh’s arm was severed cleanly.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  At the same time, the floating divine eye moved close to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You… monster!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I wondered how you’d deal with the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams formation, but in the end, you’re just stalling.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The final disciple of the Martial God, Gilgamesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though he had often shown pathetic behavior, his power of regeneration was a potential subject of research.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hoping he might manifest some new ability upon nearing the World Tree,
 </p>
 <p>
  He had observed Gilgamesh discreetly.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the end, Gilgamesh’s solution was to stall and wait for Seong Jihan to die.
 </p>
 <p>
  That was not helpful at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Urk…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Utter disappointment until the very end, Gilgamesh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Step. Step.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan slowly approached and held his dark sword up to Gilgamesh’s throat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ve lived a long time, haven’t you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Urgh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have many things I’d like to ask you…”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the fifth disciple of the Martial God, Gilgamesh had many secrets worth extracting.
 </p>
 <p>
  Starting with his power of regeneration,
 </p>
 <p>
  his initial agreements with the Martial God, and his connection to the Void.
 </p>
 <p>
  He held many keys that could unlock several mysteries.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I bet he would try to trade his information for his life, and I can’t let that happen.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The first human to bear the Red Factor, Gilgamesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had to disappear for good today.
 </p>
 <p>
  Only then would humanity be completely freed from the loathsome Red Factor.
 </p>
 <p>
  The dark purple energy began to swirl around Seong Jihan’s sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s time to rest.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait, wait…! Spare me!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t embarrass yourself in front of your descendants. Die with some dignity.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud.
 </p>
 <p>
  Groveling on the seabed, Gilgamesh fell to his knees.
 </p>
 <p>
  “To live, what wouldn’t I do…! Seong Jihan, spare me. I will sincerely help you from now on!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What could you help with?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ruling humanity is bound to have trials and errors, even for you as an Administrator…! With my experience, I can solidify your rule.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ruling again, huh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Domination of humans and the desire to live.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even in the moment of death, Gilgamesh displayed his two strongest desires.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why don’t you just rest, old man?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait, wait…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  Without hesitation, Seong Jihan decapitated Gilgamesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud. Thud.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh’s head fell to the seabed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Without its head, his body
 </p>
 <p>
  sss…
 </p>
 <p>
  failed to withstand the Void energy and soon dissipated.
 </p>
 <p>
  [So he’s really dead now. Is he?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Since he used whatever power he had left to come here, subduing him was easy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan lightly replied to the startled Pythia at Gilgamesh’s death.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘His head… still remains.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He noticed Gilgamesh’s skull lying on the seabed, resisting the Void energy that had swept away the rest of his body.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan chuckled meaningfully.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite being bathed in the Void energy, mere flesh and bones had survived.
 </p>
 <p>
  While reflecting on this,
 </p>
 <p>
  Sssss…
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Purple Void energy began to consume Gilgamesh’s skull, causing it to wither away, with the bones beginning to melt.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike the body, the head took longer to succumb to the Void.
 </p>
 <p>
  […]
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia’s divine eye flickered, observing the strange phenomenon intently.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright. Since Gilgamesh is dead, time to hand over the divine eye.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [So Gilgamesh is dead, you say…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t he?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan blinked one eye as he spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  […Yes. He is.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia responded and asked Seong Jihan a counter question.
 </p>
 <p>
  [So, what will you do with the divine eye? Will you accept it?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll accept it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan pointed to his forehead.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Put it here. But you know you’ll die once the eye is transferred… Are you ready for that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. Now that the Red Factor is gone, I want to rest.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The divine eye slowly moved, adhering to Seong Jihan’s forehead.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash. Flash…
 </p>
 <p>
  The light began to fuse into Seong Jihan’s skin.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Seong Jihan, please… handle it all until the end.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Pythia’s voice weakened as she mentioned the ‘end.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As the light from Seong Jihan’s forehead faded,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Special Authority: Divine Eye has been transferred.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Received Divine Eye from a lower-tier player. The effects are significantly reduced.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The system message confirmed the transfer.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan touched his forehead.
 </p>
 <p>
  The divine eye had indeed entered, but its power was weak, as the message indicated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…I don’t even know how to activate it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The method to harness the divine eye remained a mystery.
 </p>
 <p>
  Maybe, he should have received it before becoming an Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No. If I hadn’t become an Administrator, she wouldn’t have given me the eye.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The whole reason for getting the eye was that Seong Jihan had eradicated the Red Factor.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he hadn’t become the Blue Administrator, Pythia would have continued helping the Martial God and fighting him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, I’ll ask my sister about this later…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan moved his hand away from his forehead.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He grabbed Gilgamesh’s skull from the seabed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got anything else to say?”
 </p>
 <p>
  He saw several small bones forming chains inside the inverted skull.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Whoa. He’s actually using regeneration even in his skeletal state.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He marvelled at the sight.
 </p>
 <p>
  Wriggle. Wriggle.
 </p>
 <p>
  The bone chains weakly moved in the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Seong… Jihan…! Did you figure it out…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course. Your body was gone, yet your skull remained intact.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Urgh… Urgh…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You really… have a strong will to live.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan examined the half-dissolved skull.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Can I store this in my inventory?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The thought struck him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Inventory.”
 </p>
 <p>
  To satisfy his curiosity, he opened his inventory and placed the skull inside, then took it out.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment,
 </p>
 <p>
  [You… I’m not an item…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh’s skull shouted at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh… You’re still conscious?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Amazing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan admired Gilgamesh’s tenacity for survival once more and shoved the skull back into his inventory.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘In this state, there’s no rush to make him disappear.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He could extract more information later.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan finished dealing with Gilgamesh and looked at the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The final seal of the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams formation… should I enter now?’
 </p>
 <p>
  He had lacked the power to break it before.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, he felt strong enough to withstand the forces within the formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Should he dismantle the seal right now?
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan contemplated the seal,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  A light flickered from his forehead.
 </p>
 <p>
  The divine eye, whose activation method had been unknown, responded on its own when focused on the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  And what the divine eye revealed was…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…What is this?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Next to the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams formation,
 </p>
 <p>
  was Seong Jihan’s severed head lying on the ground.

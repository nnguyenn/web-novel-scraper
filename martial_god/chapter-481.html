  Chapter 481
 </p>
 <p>
  The scene shown by the divine eye that revealed the future.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing Seong Jihan’s decapitated head there…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Does that mean I die here in the future…?’
 </p>
 <p>
  And the scene of the decapitated head next to the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams formation, it seems related to Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s head rolled briefly on the seabed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  As the water began to fill the area again, his head floated up.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘My face looks dazed.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan observed the floating head carefully.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since he had been defeated, it was obvious why his head was cut off.
 </p>
 <p>
  But why was his face so clean?
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially the left side which contained Void energy…
 </p>
 <p>
  It was slightly grazed at the chin, just like when he first embedded the Void energy into his face.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘In the future, I look better than now?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks to the Blue stat, the severance function had become somewhat effective.
 </p>
 <p>
  He planned to test restoration on his face.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking at the future version of his face, it seemed like it worked.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The issue is that I’m decapitated…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, considering Pythia’s downgraded divine eye was implanted in him,
 </p>
 <p>
  it wasn’t entirely reliable to say it accurately showed the future.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Assuming this to be true, I’d better prepare more thoroughly.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan watched as his head floated higher and faded out of view, lost in thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  When fighting Dongbang Sak, one must always assume the worst.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was a monster who quickly soared the distortion of Martial Soul because the Martial God released some restrictions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though he had become a temporary Administrator and his power has increased,
 </p>
 <p>
  It was wise to prepare assuming he’s at a disadvantage.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So far, the divine eye has shown me being defeated and decapitated by what seems to be Dongbang Sak. And my face is much more recovered… So, two things.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Was there any more information?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan tried to shift his gaze.
 </p>
 <p>
  The downgraded divine eye seemed fixed and wouldn’t change angles.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It would be helpful to see the surroundings, but it’s unfortunate.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan’s severed head completely rose from the seabed, only the pattern of the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams formation was visible.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then he should at least examine that.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan compared the current Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams formation with the one shown by the divine eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The future’s Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams formation… Now that I look closely, its color has lightened. Many lines have disappeared as well.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though he couldn’t observe it earlier due to the scene of his own decapitated head.
 </p>
 <p>
  The future Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams formation indeed looked different from the current one.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just by viewing it, the future’s formation seemed weakened.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm… Did I perhaps partially dismantle the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams formation?’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was scrutinizing the changes, a sudden light appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  A light sword abruptly appeared above the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams formation and pierced through it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is… The sword of Dongbang Sak I saw before.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The cause of the rising distortion of Martial Soul, the light sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  As more swords began to sprout, they uniformly penetrated the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then…
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  The swords simultaneously emitted light.
 </p>
 <p>
  The view turned completely white in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  “…It’s over.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The world reverted to its original state.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Seeing the light sword, it seems clear that Dongbang Sak cut my head.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Nobody else could create such a sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Confirming the suspect who severed his head, Seong Jihan looked at the actual Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Looking at this again, I can be sure. The Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams formation shown by the divine eye was weakened.’
 </p>
 <p>
  And Seong Jihan inferred that he was the one who weakened the formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  If Dongbang Sak had tampered with the formation, it wouldn’t be merely weakened but completely dismantled.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm… But wasn’t there just the World Tree inside? Why couldn’t I dismantle the formation?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The final seal of the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams formation.
 </p>

 <p>
  Before, it seemed impossible to approach.
 </p>
 <p>
  But now, as a Blue Administrator, it didn’t seem that difficult.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike the ambiguous scene shown by the divine eye, he felt capable of dissolving it entirely.
 </p>
 <p>
  Was there a reason for his future self to leave it intact?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…I have to go in and check.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Contemplating it from outside wouldn’t yield any answers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to enter the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams formation to verify.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he placed his foot on the central red dot,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  His body was sucked into the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Could it be a strong opponent made me unable to dismantle the formation?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Expecting such a scenario, he entered the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Why is it so peaceful?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Contrary to his expectations, the inside of the final seal was calm.
 </p>

 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the final seal of the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  It contained the red World Tree, seen before.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Unlike before, Dongbang Sak isn’t guarding it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike the previous seal where he encountered Dongbang Sak and Asoka from Siddhartha’s era.
 </p>
 <p>
  The final seal only housed the World Tree alone.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘In the past, entering itself seemed impossible… The difficulty was entering the formation. The inside just contains the World Tree.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking this, Seong Jihan looked around.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a barren land, the red World Tree stood tall alone.
 </p>
 <p>
  Contrary to its appearance, which lacked any vegetation, the life energy here was denser than in any place Seong Jihan had seen.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Life energy leaking outside the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams formation… Inside, it’s so rich it’s suffocating.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If Gilgamesh had entered here, he would have quickly recovered.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan examined the World Tree,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  The cracks on the left side of his face caused by Void began to heal slightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The cracks on my face… are healing.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Touching his face lightly in astonishment,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Void energy decreases by 5.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Efficiency of the incomplete stat “Eternity” increases slightly.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Messages indicating the disappearance of Void energy and an increase in the efficiency of the incomplete stat “Eternity” appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So the red World Tree… Is it what healed my face in the future?’
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t thanks to the Blue stat’s restoration ability.
 </p>
 <p>
  The red World Tree inside the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams formation healed his face with its life energy.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The life energy emitted by this World Tree is truly extraordinary.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Healing the Void cracks and enhancing the incomplete “Eternity” stat.
 </p>
 <p>
  This exceeded the realm of ordinary World Trees.
 </p>
 <p>
  Was it because it combined properly with the red?
 </p>
 <p>
  In terms of extending life, this would be considered an upgraded version.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Just standing here will heal the Void cracks.’
 </p>
 <p>
  His cracked left face.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike the slightly grazed face before, the expanded cracks naturally brought instinctive aversion from people.
 </p>
 <p>
  While people’s fear of his face wasn’t a big concern,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The issue was that my lifespan was running out fast.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Void-induced cracks could anytime cause his body to collapse.
 </p>
 <p>
  In front of his worried niece or others, he had confidently declared there was a way to heal it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Frankly, he didn’t actually have a solution.
 </p>
 <p>
  An idea to develop the Blue stat’s restoration function?
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s all he had.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But who would’ve thought an easy solution existed.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Just standing near the red World Tree inside the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams formation made him recover.
 </p>
 <p>
  Furthermore,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I use Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit to draw more life energy from this World Tree… the healing will accelerate.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even by merely absorbing the life energy floating around, his recovery was this fast.
 </p>
 <p>
  Drawing power directly from the World Tree would accelerate the healing.
 </p>
 <p>
  His face would return to its original state, and the stat “Eternity” might even lose the “incomplete” label.
 </p>
 <p>
  The only downside to this change was the disappearance of Void.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…If I hadn’t seen the future with the divine eye, I would’ve immediately tried it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan laughed bitterly.

 </div>
 <p>
  What’s the use of fixing his face?
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak would sever his head anyway.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially without Void, One Sword Breaks the Sky might weaken or become unusable.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is that why I got decapitated… I still need Void.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Facing Dongbang Sak’s impending battle, weakening One Sword Breaks the Sky wasn’t an option.
 </p>
 <p>
  After observing the red World Tree for a while.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Void energy decreases by 10.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Efficiency of the incomplete stat “Eternity” increases slightly.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Let’s leave.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After losing 10 more Void stat, he turned away from the World Tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  There would be other opportunities to heal the cracks.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Defeat Dongbang Sak and return.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking this, Seong Jihan exited the formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams formation came back into view.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The formation is slightly weakened…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Its color had faded, and a few lines had disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Did it weaken because he absorbed some life energy?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So the formation shown by the divine eye weakened because I stayed inside longer.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Honestly, he understood the sentiment.
 </p>
 <p>
  It healed the Void cracks that might devour him anytime.
 </p>
 <p>
  It even perfected the “Eternity” stat.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I hadn’t seen the future decapitation, I would’ve stayed there forever…’
 </p>
 <p>
  After smacking his lips a few times,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan gave up lingering and surfaced from the seabed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should ask my sister about using the divine eye when I get home.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Since he has obtained it, he should make good use of it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking this, Seong Jihan entered his home through a window.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, Uncle. Long time no see?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, waving nonchalantly, greeted him from the living room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan sensed something unusual in her words.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Long time no see?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, it’s been two weeks.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Two weeks have passed?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Two weeks.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan widened his eyes in shock.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… To you, Uncle, it might’ve felt brief? I thought Gilgamesh must’ve run very far.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No. I quickly caught him.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh wasn’t even a variable.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking about the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams formation, Seong Jihan realized,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Time inside the formation must flow differently.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If he stayed longer absorbing life energy in there,
 </p>
 <p>
  Time could’ve passed quickly outside.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I left just in time.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Without the divine eye’s foresight, he might’ve lost his head in there unaware of the passing time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking he had made the right choice,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan asked Yoon Seah,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where’s your mom? Is she out?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mom? She’s doing something with the Queen.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “With the Shadow Queen?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. She should be back soon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking of learning how to use the divine eye but finding his sister out was unfortunate.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Since she’ll be back soon, I should check my own condition for now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Opening the system, Seong Jihan saw a piled-up message.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Big trouble, big trouble, Head!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hey… Are you ignoring my message because I called you Head? Come on, we’re closer than that~]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Okay. No reply, huh… Fine, I’ll be respectful. Blue Administrator! We are in big trouble!]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Why is this guy messaging again?’
 </p>
 <p>
  A series of messages from the Dead Star Constellation.
 </p>
 <p>
  What now?
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan checked,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ding.
 </p>
 <p>
  Another message from him arrived.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You saw the messages! Head, it’s a real big deal!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Why?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Sun King… has turned red!]

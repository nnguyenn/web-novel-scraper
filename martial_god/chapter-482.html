  Chapter 482
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzzz…
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan stared at the screen displayed by the Dead Star Constellation, Karlein.
 </p>
 <p>
  A cluster of light surrounding the dark-sealed red.
 </p>
 <p>
  The colors flickered with alternating red and white light.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You found out the red’s location again?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yeah, I tracked the Sun King’s forces and followed their movements. They’ve concentrated all their power there.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… So that light cluster is the Sun King?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Correct. And among them…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzzz…
 </p>
 <p>
  As the red and white lights alternated, a giant figure of light appeared within the cluster.
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s likely the real form of the Sun King.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… That giant was originally white, but it’s red now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yeah, it switches back and forth, but ever since it turned red, it seems to have grown stronger… I contacted you because you’d be the best at identifying that red light.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Identify, huh… Are you asking me to see if it’s related to the Red Administrator?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yeah. You’re the one who is able to counter red, after all.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan chuckled at that and closely observed the screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  The red light emitted by the Sun King did indeed remind him of the Red Administrator’s power.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm, just looking at it isn’t enough.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yeah, I guess it’s hard to determine from a video… Want to come over here and check it out firsthand?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “How am I supposed to get there?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I’m already set up nearby. I can summon you here, Head!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Summoning, huh.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, if things go wrong over there, I can always return using the Golden Wheel.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The total number of times he could use Golden Wheel was three.
 </p>
 <p>
  It felt wasteful to use it here, but if the Sun King’s transformation was due to the Red Administrator, it was crucial to confirm it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Sun King taking control of Martial God… Honestly, that wouldn’t be much different, but the Red Administrator controlling Martial God is another story.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sun King positioned among the Great Constellations.
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering how he had easily subdued the Dragon Lord, another Great Constellation, the Sun King wasn’t particularly a threatening entity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, even if he seized control of the Martial God, it wouldn’t drastically change the current situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the Red Administrator was different.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If the Red Administrator harnesses the accumulated power of Martial God’s infinite regressions, it would be much more troublesome than the current Martial God.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the Red Administrator he had encountered wasn’t particularly strong, he created considerable problems nonetheless.
 </p>
 <p>
  Granting him more power could lead to an unbearable situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If it’s true that the Red Administrator has seized the Sun King, I must hinder him.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With this thought, Seong Jihan accepted Karlein’s summoning.
 </p>
 <p>
  […Uh, Head. It seems you can’t be summoned because your rank is too high.]
 </p>
 <p>
  But a problem arose.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can’t be summoned because I’m an Administrator?”Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yeah. Even other means of transportation like portals are restricted since Earth is a direct jurisdiction of an Administrator.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Sometimes, being an Administrator seemed to work against him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan brooded over Karlein’s message.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Can’t I just use Warp?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even the lower-level Constellation Karlein had been able to cross vast distances using Warp and portals.
 </p>
 <p>
  Being an Administrator, why wouldn’t he be able to?
 </p>
 <p>
  With that thought, he asked Karlein.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where can I learn functions like Warp for planetary movement?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [High-level Constellations get that feature unlocked, you know.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I skipped straight to being an Administrator, bypassing the Constellation phase.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Oh right~. Then yeah, you wouldn’t have had the chance to use Warp. Hmm… I’ve never come across a case like this, so I can’t say.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Was this a side effect of jumping from a Constellation candidate to an Administrator?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan pondered alternative solutions.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Ah, I could just ask directly.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He opened the Administrator system and posed his question.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Would you like to unlock the Warp function?]
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  For a change, the system seemed willing to comply.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh… Doesn’t this require special permission?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Warp is a basic function provided to high-level Constellations. It does not require Administrator privileges to unlock this function.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Great.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Had he known, he would have inquired about Warp sooner.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the cooperative system message, he intended to ask Karlein for coordinates, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Unlocking the Warp function will take 100 days.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “100 days?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The time required to unlock the Warp function was no joke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come on… Why does it take 100 days to unlock Warp?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s the minimum time required to unlock the Warp function for an Administrator.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can’t I speed it up with my privileges?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Using temporary Administrator privileges cannot alter the duration.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Warp function, specific to Administrators, took 100 days to unlock.
 </p>
 <p>
  But modifying the duration wasn’t possible due to his temporary status.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Normally, 100 days wouldn’t feel too long… But the timing’s bad this time.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God had been sealed for three months already.
 </p>
 <p>
  Most of the sealing period had already passed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Waiting for 100 days would mean the situation would likely end by then.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Looks like challenging the Sun King in person is too difficult.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan observed Karlein’s screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking he couldn’t make it across, the changing color of the Sun King seemed even more linked to the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  But leaving things be, was unsettling.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey. Didn’t you want to seek revenge against him? How about challenging him? Too tough?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tsk… Honestly, before he turned red, I could have landed a blow. But since his color changed, his power’s way too overwhelming.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You stand no chance at all?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yeah… Even if I ambush him at full force, I feel like it wouldn’t make a dent.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Even Karlein, who burned with hostility against the Sun King, admitted defeat.
 </p>
 <p>
  This definitely suggested a connection with the Red.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…But do I really have to intervene personally?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan pondered, watching Karlein’s screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shouldn’t ongoing issues with the Red Administrator be handled by the permanent Administrators?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I chased him away from Earth, the rest should be Black and White’s responsibility.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  An intern shouldn’t have to travel for such a distant mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  He addressed the Administrator system.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can I contact my superiors?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Sending a message is possible.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Attach that video and request an investigation, suggesting that the Red Administrator seems involved.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Message sent…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Being an Administrator sure made delegating tasks to the system convenient.
 </p>
 <p>
  Feeling the pride of an Administrator, Seong Jihan awaited the response.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon,
 </p>
 <p>
  [A response has arrived.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The matter is currently under investigation.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [However, the Sun King’s faction claims the red light is part of his abilities and refuses a thorough examination.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Unless clear traces of the Red are confirmed, permanent Administrators cannot intervene.]
 </p>
 <p>
  They were investigating, but direct intervention was currently impossible.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Permanent Administrators are surprisingly limited.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Supposedly the overseers of the universe, they seemed quite restricted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then can permanent Administrators Warp me there?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Warping is also considered intervention.]
 </p>
 <p>
  So, nothing worked?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Are they deliberately blocking me from going?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The lack of intervention from permanent Administrators felt intentional.
 </p>
 <p>
  Should he just watch over things then?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If the Red Administrator gains Martial God’s power, this is terrible…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan stared at the screen.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Desperately wanting to intervene, but utterly powerless.
 </p>
 <p>
  Would he be left to just watch because of physical distance from Tuseong?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm… Are they aware of this within Tuseong?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan focused on the inside of the light.
 </p>
 <p>
  Where the Darkness-sealed red resided.
 </p>
 <p>
  Those within the sealed compound might not even be aware of the Sun King’s transformation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They might know the Sun King is waiting, but not about the Red Administrator.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If the red’s confinement obstructs their view of the outside,
 </p>
 <p>
  they might be clueless about the Sun King’s change.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Worth a shot to inform them.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Helping the Martial God seemed counterintuitive, but helping the Red Administrator take over would be worse.
 </p>
 <p>
  Assessing the situation soberly, Seong Jihan decided to inform Karlein.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Karlein, I need to stream this on BattleTube.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [This? Why broadcast it?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “To inform those within Tuseong.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Even if Martial God gets the info… the guy is the 17,777th child of the Sun King. Even if he knows, he can’t respond.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s someone else who can respond. Not just the Sun King’s child.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Oh, are you talking about the Cosmic Demon? He’s strong, but just a standard Constellation. He wouldn’t stand a chance.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Evaluating Dongbang Sak from a normal perspective, the Dead Star Constellation underestimated him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan smirked at those words.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll see. I think he can handle it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you say so, Administrator, I’ll look forward to it. Use the footage however you like. I’ll keep filming from afar.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With Karlein’s permission, Seong Jihan immediately started streaming on BattleTube.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  “And so, we cannot ignore the possibility that the Red Administrator has influenced the Sun King’s transformation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s latest BattleTube stream.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike his usual stimulating content, today’s broadcast focused solely on the Sun King’s siege of Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  But despite the lack of typical excitement,
 </p>
 <p>
  – Oh no, did the Red Administrator resurrect again?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Just seeing red gives me PTSD honestly
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers reacted strongly to the idea of the Red Administrator using the Sun King as a host.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Why is the Sun King letting his body be taken over? Is being a Great Constellation that trivial?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Well Dragon Lord was also shattered by Seong Jihan…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Aren’t they in Tuseong, the place that made Seong Jihan suffer when summoned? Isn’t it good if they fight among themselves??
 </p>
 <p>
  – They could fight hard, but if the Red Administrator absorbs Martial God, our foes will double.
 </p>
 <p>
  Human viewers fully trusted Seong Jihan and believed the Red Administrator had invaded the Sun King.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Just because the color changed doesn’t mean the Red Administrator took over, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Still, if the Blue Administrator says so, he must have seen something…
 </p>
 <p>
  – If the Red was really involved, wouldn’t Black and White have already intervened?
 </p>
 <p>
  – But do they ever really get involved? Remember, the Arena Owner turned out to be with the Red anyway.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Black and White would only act on solid evidence.
 </p>
 <p>
  – They won’t intervene based just on suspicion;
 </p>
 <p>
  However, viewers from other worlds had mixed opinions.
 </p>
 <p>
  On top of that,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Great Constellation ‘Sun King’ finds accusations baseless and offensive.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The red tint is due to reclaiming scattered abilities linked to the Red. I emphasize that I have no relation to the Red Administrator.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Messages from the Sun King himself popped up, rebutting Seong Jihan’s stream.
 </p>
 <p>
  – If the Red Administrator had taken over, we wouldn’t get messages from the Great Constellation ‘Sun King.’
 </p>
 <p>
  – Did the Blue Administrator make a mistake?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Seriously… Perhaps it’s spite due to some past conflict with the Sun King.
 </p>
 <p>
  – But what conflict would there be? The Sun King only seemed to help the Blue Administrator in the end.
 </p>
 <p>
  – If you only consider outcomes, the whole world aided the Blue. Still, the Sun King did cause inconvenience.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sun King directly countering Seong Jihan’s claims swayed off-world opinions, making Seong Jihan appear rash.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the Sun King truly was possessed by the Red Administrator,
 </p>
 <p>
  there wouldn’t be a message identifying him as the Great Constellation ‘Sun King.’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Is that really the Sun King?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as Seong Jihan pondered, suddenly unsure,
 </p>
 <p>
  – Uh…? But now…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Tuseong is glowing…?
 </p>
 <p>
  Sealed in darkness, Tuseong began to change.

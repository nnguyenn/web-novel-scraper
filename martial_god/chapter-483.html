  Chapter 483
 </p>
 <p>
  Amidst the seal forged by the Administrator, where darkness reigned.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, after Seong Jihan’s comment regarding the Sun King’s transformation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Significant changes, even detectable by ordinary observers, began to unfold inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash…!
 </p>
 <p>
  A brilliant white beam pierced through the darkness.
 </p>
 <p>
  It extended toward where the Sun King stood.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, can you zoom in on that light?”
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, the screen quickly zoomed in.
 </p>
 <p>
  Obedient indeed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought, examining the massive beam.
 </p>
 <p>
  A white-bearded elderly man stood within.
 </p>
 <p>
  He contrasted sharply with the world dyed in brilliant white, calmly stroking his beard amidst the extending light.
 </p>
 <p>
  And behind him, several colossal weapons were stationed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Weapons far too large for any human to wield.
 </p>
 <p>
  These emanated a faint blue light within the brilliant white.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Constellation relics… Has the Martial God supported him?’
 </p>
 <p>
  A collection of 50 pieces of Constellation relics.
 </p>
 <p>
  The crimson light emitted from them connected with Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God had bolstered his strength in such manner, so it appeared Dongbang Sak too gained such support.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But only 50? The number is rather small.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recalled his past battle with the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  Back then, connecting to at least 500 was standard, this time, merely providing such little support seemed lacking.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the Sun King can’t be stopped, he’d be overtaken, yet he offers only limited support.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is he afraid that giving too much power would cause Dongbang Sak to slip from his control?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Such a stingy fellow.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan clicked his tongue in disapproval.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh… Is that the Cosmic Demon?
 </p>
 <p>
  -I never thought the seal would be broken from that side.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Even if it’s the Cosmic Demon, they can’t match the Sun King’s force.
 </p>
 <p>
  -He’s at least receiving support with the Constellation relics, though.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Only 50 pieces… Didn’t the Martial God mobilize 500 when fighting Seong Jihan?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why provide so little support now?
 </p>
 <p>
  Even the alien viewers pointed this out.
 </p>
 <p>
  During the battle against Seong Jihan, who was merely a Constellation candidate, the Martial God mobilized 500 pieces.
 </p>
 <p>
  Against the Sun King, who might have ties with the Red, using only a tenth of that puzzled everyone.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thunk.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak stopped stroking his beard.
 </p>
 <p>
  “As expected… You’ve grown stronger than anticipated. Sun King. Or should I call you the Red Administrator?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Raising his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sword of the Light.
 </p>
 <p>
  The light piercing through the seal gathered at his feet.
 </p>
 <p>
  What emerged was a sword glimmering with light.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘55 swords… Emerging here.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead of the Taiji Sword, the light swords that were created by Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  The main culprits behind the distortion of the Martial Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nothing has changed. Nothing can penetrate Tuseong.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Dongbang Sak lowered his arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  The swords shot toward the seal.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hssss…!
 </p>
 <p>
  A bright mark was etched onto the sealed red.
 </p>
 <p>
  The 55 swords rapidly moved, carving a massive pattern over the dark seal.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is that… An adaptation of the Nine Palace Eight Trigram?’
 </p>
 <p>
  A pattern similar to the seal, the Nine Palace Eight Trigram.
 </p>
 <p>
  The only difference was the scale, enough to engrave the entire darkness-sealed red.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
 </p>
 <p>
  And then.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the light in the pattern flashed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sun King’s power was sucked into the formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh… It’s over…
 </p>
 <p>
  -50 pieces were enough for the Cosmic Demon…
 </p>
 <p>
  -That wasn’t the Sun King’s main body?
 </p>
 <p>
  -What kind of pattern absorbs light so easily?
 </p>
 <p>
  -It reminds me of the seal the Martial God used against other Constellations…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Great Constellations aren’t that impressive, it seems.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Perhaps humanity is the real issue here.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Great Constellation Dragon Lord had lost completely to Seong Jihan, a Constellation candidate.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the Sun King’s power absorbed quickly by Dongbang Sak’s formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  The alien viewers debated whether Great Constellations were trivial or if humanity was a bugged race.
 </p>
 <p>
  The swift and overwhelming disappearance of the Sun King’s light was indeed amazing.

 <p>
  ‘If that guy isn’t the Red Administrator but the Sun King, this would end here.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought while observing the vanishing light.
 </p>
 <p>
  The seal perfectly drawn over the darkness, absorbing all external light.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he were the original Sun King, there was no escaping from this formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  The 55 light swords had created an impenetrable seal.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Fufu…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  From within the seal, a red light flashed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon, flames began to ignite over the pattern.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unable to invade the interior,
 </p>
 <p>
  flames erupted over the drawn symbol.
 </p>
 <p>
  They quickly gathered, soon transforming into the shape of a giant.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Erasing species limits won’t stop a monster like this from emerging.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A giant of light, covered in red eyes throughout its body.
 </p>
 <p>
  A familiar figure by now to the human viewers.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Holy, those red eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh, it really is the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  -He’s got incredible persistence. When will this guy finally disappear?
 </p>
 <p>
  -To reach the top rank on BattleNet, you need that kind of tenacity, it seems…
 </p>
 <p>
  -With so many monsters here, that resilience is basic…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Still, couldn’t he go somewhere else instead of always showing up?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the Red Administrator appear again, viewers expressed heated resentment.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak, observing him, stroked his beard.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you the Red Administrator?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [No, I am the Sun King. Calling me a foolish disciple unable to gather strength despite the long time would fit better.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Calling himself the Sun King while criticizing his own apprentice.
 </p>
 <p>
  Both in appearance and insinuation, anyone could identify him as the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You really are the Red Administrator. This works out well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Snap.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak ripped a few hairs from his beard.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Allow me to test this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The hairs clumped together.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon transforming into a giant blue sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This is…]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator, who had previously appeared relaxed,
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon seeing the sword, widened the red eyes across his body.
 </p>
 <p>
  Naturally so.
 </p>
 <p>
  The blue sword Dongbang Sak had summoned.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Isn’t that the Blue Administrator’s weapon?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Greatly resembled Seong Jihan’s Blue Sword.
 </p>
 <p>

 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Why is he using that?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan furrowed his brow upon seeing the blue sword in Dongbang Sak’s hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Always learning from Dongbang Sak,
 </p>
 <p>
  It felt odd to see his own skill mirrored.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Are you in league with the Blue Administrator?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not identical. Just a mere imitation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Very fine imitation indeed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I possess some minor skills.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Poof…
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak pointed the sword tip at the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The blue created to sever red… Let’s see if mine achieves a similar result.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lowering the blue sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  The blue aura from the blade.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instantly sliced through the Red Administrator’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  But.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Surely not in league, huh.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Flames erupted from the cleft in his body.
 </p>
 <p>
  Quickly restoring the Red Administrator to his original form.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your sword doesn’t sever me at all.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so? That’s good news, indeed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […What?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “This means there’s much more training left for this sword.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the evaluation that his blue sword was far weaker than Seong Jihan’s real one,
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak seemed elated.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then how about this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  The sword expanded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Or perhaps this is better. The shape I’m most accustomed to.”

 <p>
  Morphing from the blue sword to a blue saber, it emitted a deeper blue aura.
 </p>
 <p>
  -What’s that old man doing…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Copying Seong Jihan now? No shame…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Shouldn’t this be penalized? How dare he copy an Administrator’s authority?
 </p>
 <p>
  -If he’s going to copy, why not the Red guy? This old man, seriously.
 </p>
 <p>
  The human viewers, growing more exasperated at Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan opened his mouth with a sense of discomfort.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Well, I’ve taken much from him too. Still, feels weird when roles reverse.”
 </p>
 <p>
  -Eh, it’s not the same, haha.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yeah, copying from our side is learning, others doing it is just stealing.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But the Red Administrator says it’s not even close. So it’s likely just an imitation.
 </p>
 <p>
  -True, it doesn’t seem to damage him at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the viewers pointed out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak’s blue saber wasn’t inflicting significant harm on the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The opponent, emitting flames and destructive energy, was overpowering him.
 </p>
 <p>
  -The Cosmic Demon is losing ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Well, his opponent is formidable…
 </p>
 <p>
  -But the Sun King’s identity as the Red Administrator is revealed. Why aren’t the permanent Administrators intervening?
 </p>
 <p>
  -When the Sun King sent messages earlier, it seemed not.
 </p>
 <p>
  -The Red Administrator must have done something;
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why isn’t he being apprehended?
 </p>
 <p>
  As the alien viewers pondered why the permanent Administrators didn’t intervene despite the Red Administrator’s identity being clear,
 </p>
 <p>
  “These cherished clothes… They’re quite damaged.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak, charred and with his clothes ablaze, stroked his beard observing the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  Conversely, the intact Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  […Maintaining that formation and still standing. Impressive, Dongbang Sak.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The numerous eyes embedded in the giant focused on the formation created by the 55 light swords.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still active, the Nine Palace Eight Trigram , absorbing light.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even as the Red Administrator spewed destructive energy, the formation remained intact.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Without removing those swords, you’ll never defeat me.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can’t do that. Your true target lies inside, doesn’t it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Maintaining the formation, mimicking the Blue Administrator’s power… You’re a nuisance.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you for the compliment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak, lightly cupped his fist in thanks.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan deciphered their conversation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Maintaining the Nine Palace Eight Trigram and facing the Red Administrator, hence imitating the Blue. The Blue abilities are designed to suppress the Red.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The light swords’ Nine Palace Eight Trigram, defending the entire Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  Against the Sun King, it would be sufficient, but with the Red Administrator now in control.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had to maintain the formation while fighting the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hence, he turned to the Blue for aid.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm… If he masters it better than me, it would feel quite frustrating.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Though he had learned much from Dongbang Sak through the Void,
 </p>
 <p>
  This felt different.
 </p>
 <p>
  He hoped Dongbang Sak would suppress the Red here,
 </p>
 <p>
  while not overdeveloping Blue’s abilities.
 </p>
 <p>
  With mixed feelings, Seong Jihan watched Dongbang Sak’s and the Red Administrator’s duel.
 </p>
 <p>
  -That old man fights well, though…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Seriously, his evasion skills are top-tier.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Clothes burning that little in the hellfire is impressive;
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is humanity weak because talents are concentrated in a few…?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Did Seong Jihan and that old man hog all the talent?
 </p>
 <p>
  -It makes sense to invest in promising people, but our imbalance is severe…
 </p>
 <p>
  While impressed by Dongbang Sak, both alien and human viewers,
 </p>
 <p>
  marveled at his exceptional skills.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hm, indeed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Slash!
 </p>
 <p>
  This time the Red Administrator’s cleaved body, didn’t heal instantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  [What…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Flames flickered multiple times before the giant of light restored itself.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’ve already progressed…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thanks to you. Improving through real challenges is enlightening.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hah…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator’s lamentations resonated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan shared the sentiment.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Already refining it?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Everything would be exposed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Biting a nail unconsciously while watching the blue saber,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The distortion of Martial Soul rises by 3.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Martial Soul forms a minute link with Blue.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Unexpected messages appeared.

  Chapter 484
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A connection point between Martial Soul and Blue…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan alternately looked at the message that appeared in the administrator window and the screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  It hadn’t been long since Dongbang Sak fought with the Red Administrator, yet such a message appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm…’
 </p>
 <p>
  After pondering for a moment, Seong Jihan tried drawing up the power of Blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The power of Martial Soul reacted slightly to this, enhancing Blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a result, Blue felt about 10 percent stronger than before.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This much from a weak connection?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s eyes lit up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just from watching the video, his power had increased.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But does it work in reverse too?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Since Martial Soul enhanced Blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  Could Blue enhance Martial Soul in return?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan tested Martial Soul with this thought, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This doesn’t show much difference. Just slightly stronger.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps because the two stats differed greatly in value.
 </p>
 <p>
  The effect of Blue enhancing Martial Soul wasn’t very noticeable.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But this is just from a weak connection.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It had only been a few hours since Dongbang Sak fought the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet it had already developed to this weak connection level.
 </p>
 <p>
  With more time, he would likely further develop this ability.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…This is good.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Just earlier, he had felt uneasy about Dongbang Sak using Blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now he felt like cheering him on wholeheartedly.
 </p>
 <p>
  If Dongbang Sak gained more insight into Blue, strengthening the connection with Martial Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  He could just sit back and reap the benefits.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Even if he gains more Blue ability here, it won’t significantly harm me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if he had to fight Dongbang Sak later.
 </p>
 <p>
  Any Blue abilities Dongbang Sak gained now wouldn’t be effective against him.
 </p>
 <p>
  For anything related to the ‘Blue’ stat, the Blue Administrator held absolute superiority.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather than being cut by Blue, he would likely absorb it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I hope things continue like this.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With a completely different mindset from earlier, Seong Jihan watched their battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator unleashing annihilation from all directions, and Dongbang Sak blocking with his blue sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator clearly had the initiative in the battle, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow… the Cosmic Demon is clearly being overwhelmed but.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Somehow it doesn’t seem like he’ll lose…
 </p>
 <p>
  -How can he endure like that when the Red Administrator’s power is crushing him?
 </p>
 <p>
  -This is why Constellations always disappeared when the Cosmic Demon showed up.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Right; how could mere Constellations defeat someone who fights an Administrator like this?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why is he even under the Martial God?
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers, seeing Dongbang Sak’s transcendent martial arts, didn’t think he would lose.
 </p>
 <p>
  And for good reason.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak avoided the red light pouring from all directions while stroking his beard.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh. That attack was sharp.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He blocked attacks from angles he couldn’t dodge with his blue sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  […You’re elusive.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Indeed. Try a bit harder, Administrator.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak pulled up the hem of his clothes.
 </p>
 <p>
  His clothes, which had been singed by fire in their first clash,
 </p>
 <p>
  Were no longer burning.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah. Are you being considerate because I said earlier this was a cherished outfit? I appreciate the sentiment, but I need no mercy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ha.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as he finished speaking, total annihilation rushed in from all directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Very well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  But Dongbang Sak faced the Administrator’s onslaught with a smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  And after fighting like this for several hours.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I see…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak nodded as he looked at the glowing blue sword in his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now I understand a little more.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Along with this, the sword grew larger.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak didn’t avoid the red beams of total annihilation rushing towards him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  He lightly slashed with the blue sword.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  Then.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssshhh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The red light was cut clean through.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So this is how to cut it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak stroked his beard while looking at the blue sword with satisfaction.
 </p>
 <p>
  The martial artist who had only been dodging and blocking the annihilation just hours ago was now starting to cut through it.
 </p>
 <p>
  […You’ve already gained more understanding?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s possible because of an opponent like you. I’m progressing much faster than when pondering alone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Huh.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator was momentarily speechless as he watched Dongbang Sak advance to the next level.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Martial Soul’s distortion increases by 2.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The connection between Blue and Martial Soul deepens slightly.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Good.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, watching from afar, was reaping steady benefits.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Now Blue is affecting Martial Soul too.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Dongbang Sak’s understanding advanced another level,
 </p>
 <p>
  This directly impacted Seong Jihan as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s see. Compared to earlier…’
 </p>
 <p>
  While watching Dongbang Sak slice through the total annihilation, Seong Jihan measured how much his own power had increased.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  First, he drew up Blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s about 20 percent stronger.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to before Dongbang Sak used Blue, it felt 20 percent stronger.
 </p>
 <p>
  Without doing anything at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just from watching the video Karlein sent of Dongbang Sak fighting.
 </p>
 <p>
  Blue had suddenly grown stronger due to the connection with Martial Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  And there was another change.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Until now, Blue’s cutting was specialized for red… but it seems to have gained more versatility.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps because the Blue stat originated to eliminate red,
 </p>
 <p>
  Blue’s abilities of ‘severance’ and ‘restoration’ were strongly specialized for red.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, it showed effects on other things besides red.
 </p>
 <p>
  But maybe because the stat’s grade was still ambiguous,
 </p>
 <p>
  It didn’t show tremendous efficiency for an Administrator’s ability.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  After deepening the connection with Martial Soul,
 </p>
 <p>
  Blue’s effects were gradually gaining versatility beyond just red.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This might be more important than the 20 percent power increase.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan stroked the left side of his face as he thought this.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the versatility increased further from now, there might be a way to resolve the void consuming his face with Blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  Additionally,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Martial Soul has also been enhanced about 10 percent due to the influence of my Blue stat…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even Martial Soul, which had developed as far as it could before,
 </p>
 <p>
  Was growing stronger as its connection with Blue deepened.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the first realization from Dongbang Sak didn’t have a noticeable effect,
 </p>
 <p>
  The second realization was clearly more intense, with Blue having a stronger influence on Martial Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  The two stats working in mutual complementarity.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Dongbang Sak, I’m benefiting from you again.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, this was something.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just when he thought Dongbang Sak was copying Blue, he was increasing abilities like this again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Come to think of it, he had learned quite a lot from him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If only he hadn’t cut off my neck, he’d be the Constellation who taught me the most after Ashoka…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Speaking of which, why did the neck-cutting situation occur in the future?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan speculated about the current situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I had stayed inside trying to heal my broken face, time would have kept flowing quickly.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Then he wouldn’t have been able to broadcast about the Tuseong situation like today.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Tuseong side wouldn’t have known about the Red Administrator’s intervention.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So when the seal was broken, did the Red Administrator enter there in a surprise attack?’
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, Tuseong recognized the opponent as the Red Administrator and came prepared.
 </p>
 <p>
  But in the future where Seong Jihan didn’t warn them, they might have gone to fight thinking it was just the Sun King and been caught off guard by the Red’s invasion.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, if the Red Administrator seized control of the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He might have controlled Dongbang Sak.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A Dongbang Sak controlled by the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  The thought alone was terrifying.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was speculating about the future he had seen through his divine eyet,
 </p>
 <p>
  [So the true Martial God was someone else.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator, who had been fighting Dongbang Sak, suddenly withdrew his power.
 </p>

 <p>
  “There is only one Martial God in the world.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Indeed. Not the snake cowering in fear in Tuseong, but you must be the Martial God…]
 </p>
 <p>
  As he said this, the Red Administrator’s body gradually faded.
 </p>
 <p>
  The giant form of light disappeared,
 </p>
 <p>
  Leaving only hundreds of red eyes floating in the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Fighting you any further is meaningless.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, where are you going! The battle situation is still absolutely in your favor!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak called out urgently to the Red Administrator who was trying to disappear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking at just the battle situation, he was still at a disadvantage.
 </p>
 <p>
  But his reaction was the complete opposite of that situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why is that old man disappointed when the other side is retreating?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Seems he wanted to keep gaining insight into Blue but isn’t being given the chance;
 </p>
 <p>
  -Phew, that’s a relief… I was worried Seong Jihan-nim’s authority might be taken away.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yeah, what insane rate of progress…
 </p>
 <p>
  Humanity, unaware that Seong Jihan’s abilities were improving thanks to Dongbang Sak,
 </p>
 <p>
  Was rather relieved to see the Red Administrator withdraw.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile,
 </p>
 <p>
  -But why doesn’t he use that power for humanity… Why is he on that side?
 </p>
 <p>
  -For real; just looking at his clothes he seems Asian…
 </p>
 <p>
  -That outfit is from the ancient Ming dynasty. He must be Chinese!
 </p>
 <p>
  -Okay we get it, just ask him to side with humanity ㅡㅡ;
 </p>
 <p>
  Questions about Dongbang Sak’s identity also deepened.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the Constellations serving the Martial God, those whose identities were revealed were all extraordinary.
 </p>
 <p>
  So people speculated this Oriental old man must also have an extraordinary true identity.
 </p>
 <p>
  -He is Zhang Sanfeng.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Right, didn’t he use Taiji power too? He’s 100% Zhang Sanfeng.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But Zhang Sanfeng is from much later, shouldn’t he be closer to the origin of martial arts at that level? Bodhidharma?
 </p>
 <p>
  -He looks too much like a Taoist to be a monk lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -But didn’t the aliens call him the Cosmic Demon?
 </p>
 <p>
  -A heavenly demon who’s also Zhang Sanfeng… Has he transcended both orthodox and demonic paths?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Seeing him walk in space, orthodox or demonic doesn’t seem to matter;
 </p>
 <p>
  -If he’s such an amazing figure, why is he subordinate to the Martial God?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yeah if he came to humanity’s side we could just stay on BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  -For real, the buses would increase from one to two lol
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, some of their guesses are somewhat correct.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Zhang Sanfeng and cosmic demon.
 </p>
 <p>
  Weren’t those roles Dongbang Sak played whenever he went on vacation?
 </p>
 <p>
  Even so, people don’t seem to guess as far as Jiang Ziya.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was briefly examining the chat reactions,
 </p>
 <p>
  [I have a more efficient method than battle…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  The many divided eyeballs merged into one.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator transformed into a single red eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then soon,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wh-what… How did you get here…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  It suddenly appeared in the domain of Karlein, The Dead Star Constellation, who was filming this scene from afar.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  [Have you been filming well while hiding until now?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly.
 </p>
 <p>
  A giant red eye appeared over the video.
 </p>
 <p>
  After that, Karlein’s voice was heard.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Kuk, why did you come here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I need to use that video.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Wriggle. Wriggle.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the giant red eye squirmed on the screen, Karlein tried to resist.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you think I’ll just obey you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [There’s no need for that. I’ve already taken it.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wh-why won’t it turn off?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzzing.
 </p>
 <p>
  The control had already passed to the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  The screen focus automatically rotated to center on the red eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  “H-how is this possible…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stay still.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as those words ended, the sound of burning was heard on the video.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh. Aaargh?! I-I’m undead… I shouldn’t feel pain… Wh-why does it hurt so much…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You talk too much.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Sizzle sizzle…
 </p>
 <p>
  As the burning sound grew louder, Karlein’s voice was no longer heard after that.
 </p>
 <p>
  After subduing his opponent like that, the Red Administrator
 </p>
 <p>
  Got down to his main business.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Son of the Sun King. Do you really think you can continue to control that one?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Certain that the wandering Martial God was watching this video now, the Red Administrator began to speak.
 </p>
 <p>
  What he pointed out was the issue of controlling Dongbang Sak.

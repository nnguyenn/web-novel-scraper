  Chapter 485
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This guy really isn’t taking this lying down.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Unable to win through fighting, was he now trying to drive a wedge between the Martial God and Dongbang Sak through the broadcast?
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like it might be better to just turn off the broadcast, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Undead, turn on BattleTube.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator was already prepared for that method too.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kik… Why should I listen to you? Do you think I’ll beg for mercy just because my body’s burning a little?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Karlein, engulfed in flames, mocked the Administrator’s order, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wh-what? Why is it moving on its own…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzzing…
 </p>
 <p>
  His channel on BattleTube was already activated, broadcasting this scene live.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He’s good at everything except fighting, I see.’
 </p>
 <p>
  While he couldn’t show his might against Dongbang Sak,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator clearly demonstrated his superiority in subduing Karlein.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having finished his preparations, he returned to his original point.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Son of the Sun King. You who have watched from nearby would know best. The title of Martial God suits him most. You may be controlling him somehow now, but how long will that last?]
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh, he’s immediately trying to sow discord when he can’t subdue the old man? lolol
 </p>
 <p>
  -But wasn’t the Sun King trying to take over the Martial God? Would such words from an invader have any effect?
 </p>
 <p>
  -For real, it’s like telling the king to get rid of Yi Sun-sin when Japan invades.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Well…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Um, that actually happened in real life…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Come on, this is different from that lol
 </p>
 <p>
  While people were saying the Red Administrator’s attempt to sow discord wouldn’t work,
 </p>
 <p>
  [And what do you think will happen if he continues to train in Blue?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator began to dig into what the Martial God was truly worried about.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Blue is not an ability that ends with subduing red. Its essence is the dismantling of distortions.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Having experienced it firsthand, the Red Administrator, who had somewhat grasped Blue’s abilities,
 </p>
 <p>
  Continued speaking with flashing red eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This means that your method of controlling him could naturally be nullified as Blue develops.]
 </p>
 <p>
  While he didn’t know how the Martial God controlled Dongbang Sak,
 </p>
 <p>
  As Blue, which severs distortions, develops, it could certainly render his control ineffective.
 </p>
 <p>
  [If that happens… do you really think he’ll remain friendly towards you?]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Red Administrator was about to continue speaking,
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak appeared behind him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Administrator. Unable to win by force, are you trying to drive a wedge between my master and me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, he extended his blue sword towards the eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sizzle…!
 </p>
 <p>
  That sword strike was blocked by a red barrier that appeared around the eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Driving a wedge… Huh. Why do you follow the Martial God?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You must know. That your talent shines brighter than the Martial God’s. Despite being able to claim the title of Martial God for yourself, or even aim for a new Administrator position beyond that. Why do you remain trapped in that pitiful rock?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I owe a debt of gratitude to my master, and I’ve received immortality. That is enough.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Is that so? You’ve already repaid your debt of gratitude sufficiently, and I can grant immortality too. What do you say, swordsman? Will you follow me instead?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Going beyond trying to drive a wedge between the Martial God and Dongbang Sak,
 </p>
 <p>
  Now the Red Administrator was attempting to recruit Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  -He’s indiscriminately firing attempts to sow discord;;;
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is he hoping one of them will work?
 </p>
 <p>
  -The Red Administrator really was only bad at fighting…
 </p>
 <p>
  As viewers were expressing their disgust at the Red Administrator’s actions,
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak’s sword stopped, and he frowned slightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…You’re truly noisy. I follow only the Martial God. That is all.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After briefly rubbing his brow, Dongbang Sak attacked the Red Administrator more fiercely.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the barrier remained impenetrable to his still imperfect blue sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  The red eye closely observed Dongbang Sak’s reaction.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Huhu… You just harbored doubt. And so the taboo was activated.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you hadn’t, there would’ve been no need to stop your sword.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator, pointing out what had just happened, addressed the Martial God again.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Martial God. Will you continue to rely on a taboo that wavers even at my words? His control could break at any time. Then disaster would befall you…]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Red Administrator was about to continue speaking,
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack!
 </p>
 <p>
  The blue sword fiercely attacking the barrier momentarily pierced through.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  The instantly regenerated barrier pushed it back, but.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">

   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  [Oho…]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator looked meaningfully at the part of the barrier that had been breached.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Look at this. He has progressed again. To be able to scratch my barrier… Martial God. The day when he breaks through your mental control is not far off!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You never cease talking…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  As Dongbang Sak was about to thrust his sword at the Red Administrator again,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Wait.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “M-Master…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Constellation relics connected to Dongbang Sak pulled him back.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Get to the point. Red Administrator.]
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Did the attempt to sow discord… succeed?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan clicked his tongue in disappointment at this sight.
 </p>
 <p>
  And for good reason.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Martial Soul’s distortion increases by 3.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The connection point between Blue and Martial Soul deepens further.]
 </p>
 <p>
  When Dongbang Sak pierced the barrier with his sword, the connection between Martial Soul and Blue had deepened.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘With this, Blue has been strengthened by 40% and Martial Soul by 15% compared to the beginning. I wanted to keep reaping benefits…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The more the Red Administrator and Dongbang Sak clashed like that, the more he benefited.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the fight stopped because of the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  This guy really wasn’t helpful.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was thinking this,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Have you come? Then I’ll get to the point.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator looked towards the Constellation relics and continued speaking.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I’ll give up on trying to control you. Instead, order him to kill the Blue Administrator.]
 </p>
 <p>
  […The Blue Administrator?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. Don’t you have a grudge against him too?]
 </p>
 <p>
  -What the hell is this suddenly ㅡㅡ;;
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why are they trying to send that old man when they were just fighting each other??
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ugh, that old man was crazy strong though
 </p>
 <p>
  -We were just watching the fire across the river, but now it’s crossing over…
 </p>
 <p>
  The human viewers were thrown into chaos at the Red Administrator’s instigation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, Seong Jihan, the person in question, was also frowning upon hearing this.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is how it connects?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thought to be dead, but he’s alive and interfering until the very end.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But given the Martial God’s cautious nature, I don’t think he’ll go along with those words…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recalled the Martial God’s safety-first personality and waited for his answer.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then.
 </p>
 <p>
  [While I do have a grudge against him, I can’t trust your words.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God showed the expected reaction.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Are you worried I’ll invade again if he disappears?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  [I’ll make that worry disappear.]
 </p>
 <p>
  But, as if he had anticipated this answer, the Red Administrator immediately presented an enticement.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I’ll tell you how to remove the brand the Sun King engraved.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [What?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Without that brand, I can’t control you either. Isn’t this enough to gain some trust?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The words ‘The Sun King’s 17777th son’ that were engraved on the Martial God’s body hidden in darkness.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator boldly claimed he would remove this for him.
 </p>
 <p>
  [How could you…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [A brand created by a foolish disciple, I can easily figure it out. Of course, even the method to remove it.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You can remove this so easily…?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. First, watch the brand disappear, then dispatch him to Earth. Isn’t that sufficient?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Furthermore, the Red Administrator proposed to remove the brand on his side first.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is beneficial from the Martial God’s perspective.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Not only would he learn how to remove the Sun King’s brand,
 </p>
 <p>
  But he could also send Dongbang Sak, who might break free from control at any time, to Earth to fight Seong Jihan, the enemy who had thwarted his plans before.
 </p>
 <p>
  From any angle, this seemed like a deal where the Martial God had nothing to lose.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow, the Red Administrator is really good at everything except combat…
 </p>
 <p>
  -But why is he so obsessed with dealing with Blue?
 </p>
 <p>
  -From Red’s perspective, an Administrator who’s his opposite has appeared, so he probably wants to crush him before he grows
 </p>
 <p>
  -True, Red was extremely vulnerable to Blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  As alien viewers were discussing why the Red Administrator was showing such obsession with Blue,
 </p>
 <p>
  [For now, I’ll hear the method.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Good. Removing the brand is simple…]
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  On the video, the Red Administrator was explaining to the Martial God in real-time how to remove the brand.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The method to remove the Sun King’s brand… It doesn’t feel real hearing it since I don’t have the brand.’
 </p>
 <p>
  For Seong Jihan and the viewers,
 </p>
 <p>
  -What are they talking about there?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Well… we’d have to have been branded by the Sun King to understand.
 </p>
 <p>
  -I can tell that burning the body with fire is the first step, at least…
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers couldn’t really grasp the Red Administrator’s lecture since they didn’t have the brand, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Th-that method…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Karlein, who had been subdued by the Red Administrator in the back,
 </p>
 <p>
  Was exclaiming in amazement.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Right. You had a brand too…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator brought Karlein forward,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Reveal your brand.]
 </p>
 <p>
  He ordered him to open his brand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Letters appeared on the forehead of the giant skull.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This is the Sun King’s property]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Only He may possess it]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Those who covet it, three generations shall perish]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sun King’s brand that had been engraved on Karlein.
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you follow the method I just explained, this one’s brand will be erased. Watch.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator kindly demonstrated,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Karlein’s giant skull head burst into flames all at once,
 </p>
 <p>
  And the engraved brand instantly began to disappear.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It-it’s really… gone… So easily?”
 </p>
 <p>
  After the Red Administrator’s demonstration ended,
 </p>
 <p>
  Karlein showed an incredulous reaction as he examined his own state.
 </p>
 <p>
  [How about it? Quite simple, isn’t it?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Indeed… It’s effective on me too. I can feel the brand being erased…]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God seemed to be testing it on his own body, giving a positive response.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Is this forming an alliance?’
 </p>
 <p>
  A combination of the Red Administrator and the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was quite formidable.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No, dealing with Dongbang Sak invading Earth is the first problem…’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was nice easily upgrading abilities while they were fighting, but now.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan wore a serious expression, feeling the situation had completely reversed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if he somehow managed to stop Dongbang Sak, if those two teamed up to check him again.
 </p>
 <p>
  That would be terrible too.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Geez, it’s one problem after another even as an Administrator.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was contemplating how to counter this in the future,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The brand is almost gone… Was it this easy all along?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [It seems you’ve seen the effect. Then, will you accept my proposal?]
 </p>
 <p>
  […No.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [I see… Wait, what?]
 </p>
 <p>
  From the Martial God’s side, where the brand had disappeared,
 </p>
 <p>
  An unexpected answer was coming.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I’m not afraid of the likes of the Blue Administrator. Rather, you, Red, are more troublesome.]
 </p>
 <p>
  […You, don’t tell me.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dongbang Sak, I will give you an order.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  A dark red light rose intensely from the Constellation relics,
 </p>
 <p>
  That power further strengthened Dongbang Sak’s strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, my master.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Release the formation and kill him immediately with all your might.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “The formation, you say?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. Now that the brand is gone, there’s no need to keep it anymore.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Furthermore,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God ordered the release of even the Nine Palaces Eight Trigrams that protected Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was tantamount to an order to crush the Red Administrator with full force.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Martial God… This means he’s more wary of Red than me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, from his perspective, Seong Jihan was a being who barely survived thanks to Ashoka’s betrayal,
 </p>
 <p>
  While the Red Administrator was a capable being who instantly removed the brand that had troubled him his entire life.
 </p>
 <p>
  Between the two, the more frightening existence would naturally be the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  “A very good decision, Martial God… The Red Administrator is indeed more problematic than me. Nip it in the bud here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Clap. Clap. Clap.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who had been silently watching the video until now, for the first time in his life,
 </p>
 <p>
  Gave a sincere round of applause to the Martial God.

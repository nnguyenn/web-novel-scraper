  Chapter 486
 </p>
 <p>
  A moment ago, inside Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘How empty.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God felt a sense of futility as he watched the Sun King’s brand disappear from his body.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even when he had gathered infinite power through endless regressions,
 </p>
 <p>
  This brand was a difficult problem for him to solve.
 </p>
 <p>
  So he thought it would take rising to the level of a permanent Administrator to remove it…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Red Administrator… truly exceptional.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Among all the Administrators in history, the Red Administrator was said to have shown the most outstanding ability in modifying and improving the BattleNet system.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although he couldn’t overwhelm Dongbang Sak,
 </p>
 <p>
  In areas outside of combat, he was certainly showing unparalleled aspects.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Yes, too exceptional.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God looked at his body where the brand had disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sun King’s brand, which he thought he could only remove after becoming a permanent Administrator,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator had removed it far too easily.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing how easily it was removed,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He could probably create such brands just as easily.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God looked at the screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  The red eye was showing its presence, emitting an intense light.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just when he thought it had been crushed by Seong Jihan on Earth, it quickly took over the Sun King’s body and drew up that much power.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was a dangerous being.
 </p>
 <p>
  Far more than the Blue Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll eliminate him first.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Fortunately, he still had his strongest sword left.
 </p>
 <p>
  A sword that could properly cut down the Red Administrator, who was vulnerable in combat.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dongbang Sak. I will give you an order.]
 </p>
 <p>
  And so, the wandering Martial God ordered Dongbang Sak to use all his might.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak faithfully followed this order.
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzzing…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The color of the Nine Palaces Eight Trigrams that had been blocking Tuseong’s seal faded.
 </p>
 <p>
  In an instant, swords of light appeared behind his back.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak’s aura became much more intense than before,
 </p>
 <p>
  And a blue light began to mix into the swords of light.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak, who could use his full power without needing to protect Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  His swords all flew at once, surrounding the red eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  […Martial God, breaking your promise, you’ve made a foolish choice.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing Dongbang Sak’s encirclement, the Red Administrator said this, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Promise? I never made such a thing. You just told me unilaterally.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Huh…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [I do have a grudge against the Blue Administrator, but he’s someone I can deal with anytime. I fear you more than him.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God clearly expressed his intention through the Constellation relics.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow, the Martial God… betrayed?
 </p>
 <p>
  -But he didn’t actually promise to cooperate with the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yeah, Red messed up. He revealed the method to remove the brand too freely.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Did he think he would cooperate with him?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Honestly, Red is more threatening than the Blue Administrator
 </p>
 <p>
  -That’s right, Red might be scared of Blue, but for the Martial God… he doesn’t have the power of Red, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  The alien viewers, seeing this, thought the Martial God’s choice was rather rational.
 </p>
 <p>
  Blue might be the natural enemy from the Red Administrator’s perspective.
 </p>
 <p>
  But to the Martial God, it was just one of the unique powers he hadn’t seen before.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Wow, there are times when the Martial God is helpful.’
 </p>
 <p>
  You live and learn.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan felt relieved as he watched Dongbang Sak’s swords begin to pierce the red barrier.
 </p>
 <p>
  If those two had joined hands, it would have been truly terrible, but the Martial God made the right decision.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Martial God… reconsider. If you cooperate with me, I’ll give you the authority to operate the hell. If you connect with the hell, you too can escape from the void’s subordination!]
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Sizzle…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The barrier began to break in earnest under Dongbang Sak’s fierce attack.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing this, the Red Administrator pulled out the Hellbound card to try to change the Martial God’s mind somehow, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Hell… What happened to the Arena Owner who was supposed to become its king?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The situation is different now!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s not that different. Better to betray first than be betrayed later.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You foolish…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dongbang Sak, kill him for certain. So that he can never come back to life.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God showed no interest in hell and focused solely on eliminating the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is the Arena Owner that space face with the hat?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yeah, he abandoned him at the end lolol
 </p>
 <p>
  -The Martial God must have watched Seong Jihan’s broadcast too lolol
 </p>
 <p>
  -For real, Red can’t be trusted.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the enemies who seemed about to form an alliance began to fight each other,
 </p>
 <p>
  The human viewers watched the situation with lighter hearts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Stab! Stab!
 </p>
 <p>
  Blue light swords piercing the barrier from all directions – up, down, left, and right.
 </p>
 <p>
  Going beyond piercing the black protective screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzzing…
 </p>
 <p>
  Above it, they were engraving a pattern.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is he engraving the Nine Palaces Eight Trigrams on the barrier to make sure he can’t escape?’
 </p>
 <p>
  He was really faithfully carrying out the Martial God’s order.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was truly impossible to deal with as an enemy,
 </p>
 <p>
  But in a situation like this where he was killing an enemy for you, he was more reliable than anyone.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan watched as Dongbang Sak subdued the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He’ll die soon now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Nine Palaces Eight Trigrams were being engraved flawlessly over the broken barrier.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is the end.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The swords of light all stabbed into the red eye at once.
 </p>
 <p>
  […The disciple’s body. It was quite useful, but it’s a shame. Is this annihilation?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Stab! Stab!
 </p>
 <p>
  Swords mercilessly piercing the red eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even as he was being pierced by the swords of light imitating Blue,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator’s eyeball squirmed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [But I… am everywhere…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re truly persistent. You say such things even in this situation?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Huhu… Isn’t it strange?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Why hasn’t there been any BattleNet sanction even though I’ve shown myself until now?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘The Great Sponsor’ is looking after me.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Splash!
 </p>
 <p>
  Even as blood splattered from the eye pierced by swords,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator continued speaking calmly, as if detached from this.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Kill the Blue Administrator, Martial God. Then I will show you mercy.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mercy? Mercy is for us to give. Though I have no intention of giving it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Remember this. Martial God…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack!
 </p>
 <p>
  As Dongbang Sak’s sword completely shattered the red eye,
 </p>
 <p>
  And even as all its remnants were being sucked into the Nine Palaces Eight Trigrams,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Kill Blue. Only then will I forgive today’s events…]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator was saying to eliminate Blue until the very end.

  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the Red Administrator was perfectly eliminated by Dongbang Sak,
 </p>
 <p>
  -No, even though he was killed perfectly, Red still leaves an uneasy feeling
 </p>
 <p>
  -He says he’ll return… is that possible?
 </p>
 <p>
  -The light swords completely pulverized him and all the remnants were sucked into that formation… there’s nothing left.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But because he made his last words so confidently, it somehow feels like he’ll return.
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  The viewers who watched this couldn’t hide their uneasy feelings.
 </p>
 <p>
  Certainly, the process of the Red Administrator’s death was thoroughly destructive, leaving no room for future problems.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the fact that such a being kept saying to eliminate Blue until the end was quite suspicious.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Ha, this guy really clings to me until the very end.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned, recalling the scene from earlier.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Dongbang Sak’s handling was perfect.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak, who laid out the Nine Palaces Eight Trigrams on the barrier in advance and absorbed even the smallest remnants of the red eye completely inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan couldn’t think of a more perfect way to handle that eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, it would be right to assume that the Red Administrator contained in that eye had certainly been annihilated.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But for him to be so confident… does he have a main body or a spare somewhere else?’
 </p>
 <p>
  And there was something else that bothered him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He clearly mentioned the Great Sponsor at the end.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A being that sponsors the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the current BattleNet, there aren’t many who could do this.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It would have to be the Black and White Administrators… or at most, Green might be included.’
 </p>
 <p>
  But Green was more concerned than anything about the Red Administrator rising above him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Excluding him, the candidates narrow down to two.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Black or White?’
 </p>
 <p>
  It would have to be at least that level to be called a ‘Great Sponsor’ by the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But the Red Administrator was trying to overthrow the current BattleNet system with the Hell, so why would Black and White sponsor him? And if they were going to help, they would have done so earlier…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Black and White supporting Red would be like a king helping rebels, wouldn’t it?
 </p>
 <p>
  What need was there to do that?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…If there’s one thing that bothers me, it’s the existence of the Hell.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The dead are supposed to belong to the void and disappear.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the Hell created by the Red Administrator that shook this law of BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  It hasn’t been long since this was revealed to the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps the Great Sponsor started sponsoring after the Hell appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If this guess is correct, only one of Black and White would have supported him.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If both Black and White were sponsoring Red, the Red Administrator wouldn’t have been playing around there and would have just come back to his original Administrator position.
 </p>
 <p>
  There would have been no need to target the Martial God and invade here.
 </p>
 <p>
  If so, then.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…The Hell is a world that infringes on the realm of the void. Could it be that he received support from White?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather than the Black Administrator, who is the master of the void,
 </p>
 <p>
  The White Administrator’s side seemed more suspicious.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was thinking this,
 </p>
 <p>
  -Great Sponsor… who could that be?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Isn’t he just lying about eliminating Blue to look like he has backing?
 </p>
 <p>
  -But earlier, the Black and White Administrators kept not intervening.
 </p>
 <p>
  -That’s true… even with a big-shot fugitive like the Red Administrator advertising “I’m here” on live broadcast.
 </p>
 <p>
  -If there is a sponsor, isn’t it the White Administrator? The Hell replaces the realm of the void.
 </p>
 <p>
  -It could be Black too. If he directly operates the replacement of the void with the Hell, he could extract power from it, how well would that work?
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the alien viewers too, a debate was unfolding about whether the sponsor mentioned in the Red Administrator’s last words was Black or White.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm… there is a possibility it could be Black.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was looking at the chat, considering all possibilities,
 </p>
 <p>
  -So will the Martial God kill the Blue Administrator?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Red gave him a good method earlier.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Dispatching the Cosmic Demon?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Right, wasn’t the Cosmic Demon’s mental control wavering anyway?
 </p>
 <p>
  The alien viewers were showing interest in whether the Martial God would follow the Red Administrator’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It seems many think Dongbang Sak will invade.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator had already given a guideline once,
 </p>
 <p>
  And he said that Dongbang Sak’s mental control was wavering.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s quite possible to think of getting rid of two troublemakers at once in this opportunity.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should prepare, certain of an invasion.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was thinking this and recalling the scene of Dongbang Sak fighting earlier,
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzzing…
 </p>
 <p>
  Light flashed from the Constellation relics.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
 </p>
 <p>
  [Blue Administrator.]
 </p>
 <p>
  From within, the Martial God’s voice was heard.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I have no particular intention of fighting you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What?”

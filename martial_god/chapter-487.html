  Chapter 487
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan doubted his ears when he heard the Martial God’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  No intention to fight? What on earth did this mean?
 </p>
 <p>
  As he was questioning this, the Martial God continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  [While you are the main culprit who ruined my plans… I have now found complete freedom. I no longer need to do infinite regressions, nor do I have a reason to rise as a permanent Administrator.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Of course, if you want to fight, I’ll accept anytime. But is there really a reason for us to fight now?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Rather, as long as the Red Administrator keeps you in check. It’s better for me if you remain.]
 </p>
 <p>
  In a way, that made sense.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought coldly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘To subdue the Martial God, there’s a big risk on our side too. Especially, beyond the Martial God, Dongbang Sak is the problem.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering the future scene where his neck was cut off,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God had Dongbang Sak as his strongest sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  He’d have to defeat him to challenge the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if a situation came where he could beat Dongbang Sak, by the time he got to the Martial God, he’d probably be in tatters.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Of course, Ashoka said Dongbang Sak would regain his memories if he drew the Taiji Sword… but is that worth risking my life for?’
 </p>
 <p>
  A battle with the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even for Seong Jihan, who had become the Blue Administrator,
 </p>
 <p>
  The odds of winning right now were very slim.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had only recently become an Administrator, so his authority was still weak.
 </p>
 <p>
  The void on his face was always pressing on him like a tumor.
 </p>
 <p>
  But.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I’m given time… the longer this goes, the more advantageous it is for me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The void on his face could be eliminated through the World Tree sealed in the Nine Palaces Eight Trigrams.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Administrator’s authority, Blue, was just beginning, so he could keep developing it.
 </p>
 <p>
  It might have been a problem when the void was an issue.
 </p>
 <p>
  But now that he had a means to solve it, time was on Seong Jihan’s side.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Of course, this guy isn’t someone to be trusted.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As seen when the Red Administrator died,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God was absolutely not someone to be trusted.
 </p>
 <p>
  He could say things like this on the surface, but could launch a surprise attack at any time.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So, while being as cautious as possible… I need to buy time.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Anyway, for now, it’s better not to fight.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan concluded his thoughts and turned the angle of the BattleTube he had left on to himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Fine. If you don’t intend to invade, I have no intention to fight either.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [A wise decision, Blue Administrator.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Blue Administrator and the Martial God confirmed through BattleTube that they had no intention to fight,
 </p>
 <p>
  -What? They’re not fighting?
 </p>
 <p>
  -That’s disappointing…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Well, honestly, if they fought, they’d only hurt themselves. Their domains don’t even overlap.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Come on, they should fight up there so we can rise from down here.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Anyway, they’re already so far above us, it doesn’t matter.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the alien viewers showed disappointed reactions,
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh… good, one bomb has disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Does this mean humanity can just stay on BattleNet? It’s like a peace treaty has been signed.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yeah, now we can just stay and reap the benefits𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  -Let’s just stay and evolve!
 </p>
 <p>
  -But can we trust the Martial God…? Isn’t he likely to betray after this?
 </p>
 <p>
  -I’m sure Seong Jihan-nim will prepare for that lol
 </p>
 <p>
  The human viewers greatly welcomed this peace agreement.
 </p>
 <p>
  The variable of the Martial God that many BattleNet experts had pointed out,
 </p>
 <p>
  Had been somewhat resolved through today’s broadcast.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the opinion that it would be better to continue staying on BattleNet,
 </p>
 <p>
  Began to spread instantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s just words for now, a ceasefire that we can’t be sure will be kept. Yet they’re already talking about staying based on just that.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It seems like people who originally wanted to stay on BattleNet are just raising their voices using this as an opportunity.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan glanced at the chat window to gauge public opinion,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Then, return, Dongbang Sak. We have much to do from now on.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood, my master.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God called Dongbang Sak back.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The seal… shall I completely destroy it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Leave it. We’ll have many official activities in the future, there’s no need to receive more penalties unnecessarily.]
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">

   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  “Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After eliminating the Red Administrator who had built the encirclement,
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak calmly disappeared back into the darkness-sealed Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey… that old man’s gone too, should I turn this off now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  And as the skull head, Karlein, appeared on the screen,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Good work.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, my body got pretty burned up, but thanks to that, the brand is gone…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Karlein, who had been set ablaze by the Red Administrator while filming the fight.
 </p>
 <p>
  But thanks to that, the Sun King’s slave brand had disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  For him, in the end, he had gained more than he lost.
 </p>
 <p>
  And.
 </p>
 <p>
  The one who gained the most today was Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I just watched, but how many times did I upgrade?’
 </p>
 <p>
  All he did was watch the fight between the Red Administrator and Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  As Dongbang Sak on the screen gained insight into Blue and developed Martial Soul,
 </p>
 <p>
  He ended up upgrading Seong Jihan’s power as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It would have been nice if they fought a bit longer. That Red guy was too weak… what a shame.’
 </p>
 <p>
  For an Administrator to be eliminated so easily.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan clicked his tongue in regret as he manifested blue energy.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I wonder if he won’t train in there.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was thinking this,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Martial Soul’s distortion decreases by 1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The connection point between Blue and Martial Soul weakens.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A message appeared before his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  The distortion of Martial Soul that had been continuously rising decreased as soon as Dongbang Sak entered Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Is this the Martial God’s intervention?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the Martial God rejected the Red Administrator’s proposal and subdued him instead,
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed he took note of some of his words.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Blue is not an ability that ends with subduing red. Its essence is the dismantling of distortions.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [This means that your method of controlling him could naturally be nullified as Blue develops.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The point that as Dongbang Sak develops Blue, his control might be broken.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seems he took that seriously and was doing some modification work inside Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’m not sure exactly what he’s doing in there… but does this mean my increased abilities will decrease too?’
 </p>
 <p>
  That would be a shame.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought this as he watched the distortion decrease, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Blue’ is the Administrator’s jurisdiction ability.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [This effect does not apply to Administrators.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Fortunately, while he shared the upgrade effect, it seemed the downgrade didn’t apply.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Being an Administrator is good at times like this.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Only gaining benefits without losses.
 </p>
 <p>
  Is this kind of one-sided exchange possible when you become an Administrator?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was satisfied with this result, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Still, since I don’t know when it might decrease, I should train to completely make these increased abilities my own.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He decided to train to solidify his abilities.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm… but the Void Training Room feels a bit uncomfortable.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Void Training Room that the Arena Owner had modified several times.
 </p>
 <p>
  He used it well before becoming an Administrator, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  After learning that the Arena Owner had sided with Red, he felt uncomfortable and didn’t use that place.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But now that I have power, it should be fine.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought this and tried to enter the Void Training Room, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Void Training Room’ has been closed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Unable to enter the training ground.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Only a message saying he couldn’t enter appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Closed. Because of the Arena Owner, I suppose.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was nice that time passed slowly there, what a shame.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan clicked his tongue at the closure of the training ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  This would make finding a place to train another task.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘For now, I’ll have to handle the urgent matters in the training center at home.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He got up and walked towards the training room inside his penthouse that he hadn’t used in a while.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment,
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

 </div>
 <p>
  A shadow spread from the floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a once-in-a-lifetime request. Childhood photos! With just those, I can make a viral video.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ah. Really. Did you get permission from him?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Permission? Of course he’ll give it. He’s the main investor in our channel.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […Get permission first.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Shadow Queen and Seong Jiah suddenly appeared from within.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Oh, Jihan.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh. Administrator! Perfect timing. I have something to ask your permission for.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What is it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “May I use some of your childhood photos?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  What was she talking about?
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan frowned, the Shadow Queen’s eyes sparkled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you know that all of BattleTube is focusing on you right now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, yeah. I’m always in the trending videos, aren’t I?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right. What’s difficult for other players to achieve even once, you’re doing every time. That’s how much attention is focused on the ‘Blue Administrator’ who has only recently appeared on BattleNet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…And?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan responded in a dry tone, the Shadow Queen’s eyes grew even more intense.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is the opportunity! We’ll air a Blue Administrator special! Starting from your childhood photos, we’ll create a biography looking back on Seong Jihan’s life!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Wasn’t I pretty ordinary as a kid? I was average in both studies and sports.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Well… but you were an energetic child!]
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like she was trying hard to add something positive when there was nothing to praise.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan chuckled and then waved his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t make weird specials, just do what you were doing before.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh… but this is really a blockbuster item! Aren’t you disappointed? We should strike while the iron is hot!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nah. I’m an Administrator now, so I have nothing to be disappointed about.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kuk… It’s too high a level to even envy now…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Shadow Queen expressed her disappointment at Seong Jihan’s refusal.
 </p>
 <p>
  He watched her for a moment, then turned his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “By the way, sis.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can you teach me how to use the divine eye?”
 </p>
 <p>
  […The divine eye?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. I received one, but I don’t know how to activate it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Tap. Tap.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan pointed to his forehead as he said this.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I thought something felt strange… Alright. I’ll teach you right away.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jiah nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God’s star, Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak was kneeling before the Martial God with a haggard face.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Have you forgotten your idle thoughts about Blue?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Yes, master. I have forgotten.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [No. There are still many remnants left. It will take some time to wash them away.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I understand. I will forget again…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Good.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Smoke rose from the Martial God’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  A snake-like form appeared and swallowed Dongbang Sak whole.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak, who had partially understood Blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before he could learn more about it and break the mental control on his own,
 </p>
 <p>
  It had to be made to forget.
 </p>
 <p>
  So the Martial God, who was trying to completely remove Blue from him by swallowing Dongbang Sak over and over again, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s not disappearing easily.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps the insight into Blue had a significant impact on Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  Erasing the memory of it was not as easy as expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘With this body alone, the power is insufficient.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  Dark red energy surged from the Martial God’s body and connected with the Constellation relics in the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  To more perfectly erase Blue, the Martial God was even using the power contained in the Constellation relics.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was that serious about this task.
 </p>
 <p>
  [It must be erased completely… Then it won’t waver.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  From the snake’s head, dark red energy gushed out more intensely.
 </p>
 <p>
  [When their guard is down… I will retrieve the World Tree.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside, the Martial God’s voice echoed ominously.

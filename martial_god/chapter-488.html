  Chapter 488
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There’s no need to fight the Blue Administrator.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The ceasefire proposal that the Martial God offered to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was sincere about this.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Although I’m stronger than him now, he’s an Administrator… If I try to subdue him carelessly, I might face an unexpected counterattack.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Blue Administrator, Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  He endured endlessly even when summoned to Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, he would have died if Ashoka hadn’t intervened.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anyway, despite being brought to Tuseong, he survived.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God didn’t want to take unnecessary risks.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Now that I’m free to act, there are many places to gain power… I don’t need to stay on the fringes, I can build my forces.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Until now, despite having immense power, he couldn’t freely engage in external activities due to the Sun King’s brand.
 </p>
 <p>
  But now the situation has changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  He could expand his influence externally as much as he wanted, as there was no brand to control him anymore.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘First… should I take over the dragon race now that the Dragon Lord is gone?’
 </p>
 <p>
  After the Dragon Lord was killed by Seong Jihan,
 </p>
 <p>
  The dragons were engaged in a civil war to claim the empty Lord position.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since the Martial God himself was created through the Dragon Lord’s body,
 </p>
 <p>
  He intended to participate in this dragon civil war.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Yes. It’s time to leave Tuseong.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The desolate Tuseong he had always seen through infinite regressions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now it was time to leave this place and operate from the center of BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  But for that,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should absorb all the power contained here in this star before I go…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The power accumulated through infinite regressions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before leaving, he needed to store it all within his body without leaving any behind.
 </p>
 <p>
  Currently, there was so much energy stored there that even if he absorbed it, permanent preservation wasn’t possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I retrieve the sealed World Tree, I can store the power.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The World Tree sealed under the Earth’s sea.
 </p>
 <p>
  That World Tree, dyed red, showed a clear difference from other World Trees.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he brought that to Tuseong,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can store all the energy gathered through infinite regressions inside.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, even if his power didn’t reach the level of a permanent Administrator,
 </p>
 <p>
  He could at least catch up to the Green Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  After finishing his thoughts,
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  He spat out Dongbang Sak, whom he had swallowed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dongbang Sak, have you forgotten everything?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not yet…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Blue has taken quite deep roots.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m sorry.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Dongbang Sak bowed his head deeply, the Martial God’s eyes flashed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [We must finish the job before Tuseong’s seal is broken.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that… to retrieve the World Tree from Earth?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. We must break the Nine Palaces Eight Trigrams seal and extract the red World Tree.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “If we retrieve the World Tree, what will happen to the surface?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Why, are you worried?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Though he didn’t answer, his reaction was as good as an affirmation.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God glared at Dongbang Sak as if displeased.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He’s definitely wavering.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps because he briefly lifted the limits to stop the Sun King, and because of what the Red Administrator said,
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak wasn’t showing the same loyalty as before.
 </p>
 <p>
  Originally, if given an order, he should have followed it without worrying about the surface situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…I won’t be able to use him for long either.’
 </p>
 <p>
  After retrieving the red World Tree, he’ll have to think of a way to dispose of him properly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God thought this, but for now, he answered him.
 </p>
 <p>
  [If we retrieve the World Tree, the earth will shake greatly, and the Blood clan sealed with the World Tree will emerge.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Blue Administrator is on Earth, so it should be fine. At most, about 20% of humanity might disappear.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “20%… you say.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. So don’t worry and retrieve it.]
 </p>
 <p>
  For the Martial God, who had repeatedly witnessed the extinction of humanity countless times through infinite regressions,
 </p>
 <p>
  20% was a figure he could view as “Is that all?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I suppose the damage will be concentrated near the sealing site?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Probably. But that’s not for you to worry about. The Administrator will handle it.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I understand.”𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak nodded forcefully at the Martial God’s words, but
 </p>
 <p>
  His complexion was not bright.
 </p>
 <p>
  After all, the location of the sealing site was in the center of the West Sea,
 </p>
 <p>
  So it was close to his homeland.

 </div>
 <p>
  [You’ve developed many idle thoughts.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God, noticing Dongbang Sak’s demeanor,
 </p>
 <p>
  Drew up his energy again to swallow him once more.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Reconnecting with the Constellation relics, the Martial God emitted powerful energy.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I’ll make you think only of the mission.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The snake form appeared again and swallowed Dongbang Sak once more.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Dark red energy spread from the snake’s head,
 </p>
 <p>
  And Dongbang Sak’s ‘purification’ process began again.
 </p>
 <p>
  And after devouring him, the Martial God thought,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I suppose I’ll have to use him this one last time and then make him end himself…’
 </p>
 <p>
  He decided how to finish off Dongbang Sak, who was becoming increasingly uncontrollable.
 </p>

 </p>
 <p>
  In the training room of the penthouse.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This is how I use it… it’s not working?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, it’s not activating at all.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s strange. Why isn’t it working?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, receiving education about the divine eye from Seong Jiah, frowned as it showed no sign of activating.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It showed me my neck being cut off, but nothing since then.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recalled the message he received when he got the divine eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have been implanted with the special authority, Divine Eye.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You received the Divine Eye from a player of lower rank than you. The effect of the Divine Eye is greatly reduced.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It said the effect would be greatly reduced… but I didn’t expect it wouldn’t activate at all.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though an Administrator’s rank is vastly superior to Pythia, who was a Constellation level 8,
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s still a problem if it doesn’t work at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you focus on the third eye, you should at least get a hint…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m not getting anything.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Really? Can’t you feel the flow of power gathering in your forehead?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s nothing like that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s strange… That’s how I use it. Look.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jiah said frustratedly while activating her divine eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I can create it this easily, see?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “That ‘easily’ isn’t happening for me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Haa. How can I teach this any further…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you activate it while focusing like this, you should see…]
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jiah was demonstrating how to activate the divine eye,
 </p>
 <p>
  […Huh?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, her face became serious.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Wh-what’s this?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s wrong?”
 </p>
 <p>
  […The house suddenly disappeared.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Um… wait a moment.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzzing…
 </p>
 <p>
  The eye of light moved back and forth.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Did an earthquake happen? But even for an earthquake, this is too severe…]
 </p>
 <p>
  She muttered in disbelief as she observed the future situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Oh, and there… even a red giant is coming.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Red giant?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes, with eyeballs all over its body… its form is semi-transparent.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recalled a certain being as he heard this.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Isn’t that a Great Golem?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The blood clan that continued to exist as spirit bodies even after death.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was Dongbang Sak’s karma for becoming immortal, as he had sealed these ghosts into the World Tree while wandering the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  To think that the Great Golems, which could only be seen inside the Nine Palaces Eight Trigrams before, would appear in the real world.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…If it appears in the future, does that mean something happened to the World Tree?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Just when he thought peace might finally arrive, it seemed trouble was brewing again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan asked Seong Jiah a question.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How far in the future is this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hmm… I’m not sure exactly. But it’s not too distant. Roughly 2-3 months from now?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “That soon?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seoul collapsing from an earthquake and Great Golems invading, this future was coming that quickly?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan responded with bewilderment, then his thoughts turned to another matter.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘In 2-3 months… Tuseong’s seal would be released.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Was it just a coincidence that these events overlap?
 </p>
 <p>
  Or did Tuseong do something to the World Tree?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…It’s better to prepare assuming the latter.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Come to think of it, although they agreed not to fight each other,
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s a separate issue from them interfering with the World Tree.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  What the Martial God proposed was merely avoiding conflict with Seong Jihan, the Blue Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  The World Tree wasn’t included in the peace agreement.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If it was just an earthquake, that would be one thing. But considering the Great Golems emerging… this incident is definitely related to the World Tree.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was deducing the cause of the situation through Seong Jiah’s future vision,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Martial Soul’s distortion decreases by 3.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The connection point between Blue and Martial Soul almost disappears.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Martial Soul’s distortion decreased again, and now the connection point with Blue was about to be severed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Martial God is trying to quickly erase the traces of Blue from Dongbang Sak.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Was he concerned about the Red Administrator’s attempt to shake Dongbang Sak?
 </p>
 <p>
  He’s not sure how he’s lowering Martial Soul’s distortion, but the Martial God was consistently attempting this.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Since Blue is an Administrator’s jurisdiction ability, that effect doesn’t apply to me, which is good…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The connection point between Blue and Martial Soul that Dongbang Sak had raised was now left intact only for Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the result itself was a one-sided benefit for him,
 </p>
 <p>
  After hearing Seong Jiah’s future prediction, that message felt somewhat unsettling.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm… I’d like to see the situation in Tuseong like last time.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Last time, he was able to spy on Tuseong to identify the cause of the problem when Martial Soul’s distortion abnormally increased.
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, perhaps because the distortion was decreasing, that function didn’t appear.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Martial Soul’s distortion is decreasing, can’t we see the situation?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan asked the system just in case.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The decrease in distortion is a normal situation.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [As it’s not a problematic situation, it cannot be observed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The answer came that it was impossible for this case.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… Then how about spying on Tuseong? Using my authority.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Tuseong’ is a place sealed by a permanent Administrator.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Temporary Administrators do not have the authority to observe it.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Furthermore, the system said it couldn’t be observed because it was sealed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Being new sure is tough.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan realized the limitations of being a temporary Administrator and frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  This Administrator thing, sometimes it allows unexpected things,
 </p>
 <p>
  But at times like this, there were quite a lot of restrictions.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No matter how I think about it, the future my sister saw seems related to that place…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Was there no way to see it?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan pondered for a while, then suddenly recalled something from before.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Lowering Martial Soul’s distortion… it definitely consumed 500 authority per point.’
 </p>
 <p>
  When Martial Soul’s distortion abnormally increased, the system asked if he wanted to correct it.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that time, the required authority was definitely 500 per point of distortion.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I currently have about 3000 authority…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Could he lower the distortion now too?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan asked the system.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How much can I lower Martial Soul’s distortion with 3000?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The recent abnormally increased distortion value is 15. With your current points, you can lower it by 6.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Did he raise the distortion to 15 by himself? In that short time of training?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s correct.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recalled the swords of light that had protected Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing that there were 55 in total, excluding the distortion raised by Blue,
 </p>
 <p>
  The value reached through pure self-training alone was 55.
 </p>
 <p>
  And before preparing for the Sun King, the original distortion was 40.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No matter how I think about it, his talent is really beyond comprehension.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan realized anew that Dongbang Sak was a monster for greatly increasing his distortion as soon as training was allowed, and thought about this matter.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Martial Soul’s distortion… should I try lowering it too?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Previously, he didn’t lower it thinking Dongbang Sak would quickly recover it through training.
 </p>
 <p>
  But now the situation had changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God, who previously allowed him to train, was now keeping him in check.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he also contributed here to weaken Martial Soul,
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak’s monstrous power might be somewhat controlled.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Of course, there’s the downside of Martial Soul becoming weaker… but it’s worth trying.’
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter if they’re given the same Martial Soul,
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak would handle it much better than himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  So weakening Martial Soul would impact Seong Jihan now, but
 </p>
 <p>
  It would be an even bigger blow to Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Besides, I couldn’t do it before because authority was precious, but now I’m getting 100 a day.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Previously, 100 or 200 authority was desperately needed,
 </p>
 <p>
  But now Seong Jihan had used over 10 million to upgrade the Blue stat.
 </p>
 <p>
  3000 or so was worth trying to keep Dongbang Sak in check.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Lower Martial Soul’s distortion.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Lowering the abnormally increased Martial Soul distortion…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Martial Soul’s distortion has decreased by 6.]
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s words, the system immediately began to lower the distortion.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll keep lowering it as authority accumulates.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He began to join forces with the Martial God in reducing Dongbang Sak’s power.
 </p>
 <p>
  And, ten days later.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Oh my.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God, who had been erasing the traces of Blue from Dongbang Sak,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing that his power had noticeably weakened, hesitated for a moment while summoning the snake.
 </p>
 <p>
  […His power has weakened significantly.]

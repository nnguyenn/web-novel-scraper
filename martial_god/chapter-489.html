  Chapter 489
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God looked down at Dongbang Sak, who had a tired expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  To erase the traces of Blue, he had recently been swallowing and spitting him out excessively, but
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak’s power had weakened much more than he expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to adjust the pace a bit.’
 </p>
 <p>
  When Dongbang Sak’s power weakened, the Martial God’s Martial Soul also weakened.
 </p>
 <p>
  Until now, he had pushed through despite this to eliminate the traces of Blue, but
 </p>
 <p>
  Now that he could feel the significant decrease in power, he needed to stop this decline here.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dongbang Sak, your power has decreased a lot. For the time being, recover and train.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Train… is it alright?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak’s eyes widened, as if the Martial God’s words were unexpected.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. But forget about Blue, and don’t think about honing it anymore.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At that order, Dongbang Sak slowly nodded in agreement.
 </p>
 <p>
  And as he began to train in earnest again,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…As expected, his power recovers quickly.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The power of Martial Soul that had decreased,
 </p>
 <p>
  Began to rapidly return to its original state in less than a few days.
 </p>
 <p>
  Was it because he had already walked this path once that recovery is so fast?
 </p>
 <p>
  But even so, the amount that had decreased was considerable, yet the change was this rapid.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘His talent is indeed dangerous.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God raised his guard once again as he observed Dongbang Sak’s talent.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘In the past, I even envied that…’
 </p>
 <p>
  In the very distant past,
 </p>
 <p>
  When he had just started the infinite regressions, he had envied Dongbang Sak’s talent as one of the players, but
 </p>
 <p>
  Now he considered that talent to be at the level of a system error and didn’t dare to compare himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather, through Martial Soul, he had prepared a means to exploit that ability.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s raise him just enough to be controllable, then put the leash back on.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God, completely unaware that Seong Jihan was behind the weakening of Dongbang Sak’s power,
 </p>
 <p>
  Allowed him to train.
 </p>
 <p>
  And this action,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The distortion of stat ‘Martial Soul’ has abnormally increased.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do you want to identify the cause of the problem?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh ho.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Came right back to Seong Jihan as an opportunity.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Lowering Martial Soul’s distortion significantly must have had a big impact on the Martial God himself.’
 </p>
 <p>
  So he made Dongbang Sak train again to return Martial Soul to its original state.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s identify the cause.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan used the given opportunity to spy on Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzzing…
 </p>
 <p>
  A screen appeared before his eyes,
 </p>
 <p>
  Showing the desolate star, Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  [……]
 </p>
 <p>
  In the screen,
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak was sitting cross-legged with his eyes closed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash. Flash.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing more swords of light being created around him one by one,
 </p>
 <p>
  It was understandable why Martial Soul’s distortion had risen so steeply.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘While it’s nice to be able to see Tuseong, I feel like I wasted my Administrator authority.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He lowered it by 6 with great effort, but it was quickly restored in no time.
 </p>
 <p>
  He used a month’s worth of authority, and it only lasted a few days.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was feeling regretful,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Martial Soul’s distortion increases by 2.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Martial Soul and Blue form a weak connection point.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As two swords of light flashed into existence, one soon took on a blue hue.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Oh?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Along with this, Blue gained more connection points with Martial Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  This didn’t overlap with the connection points with Blue that Dongbang Sak had built up so far.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What… Did Dongbang Sak train for me like this?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan hastily manifested his Blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  He could clearly feel that his ability had increased slightly compared to before.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This makes the Administrator authority not feel wasted at all.’
 </p>
 <p>
  When he spent 3000 and Dongbang Sak quickly recovered his power, he thought, ‘Why is that old man like that?’
 </p>
 <p>
  But now that he was developing Blue with that talent, the return on investment was enormous.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was smiling at this unexpected fortune,
 </p>
 <p>
  […Master. I’m sorry. During training, the ability of Blue connected.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [I saw.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The atmosphere in Tuseong was serious, unlike Seong Jihan’s mood.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Despite giving you so many warnings. You still thought of Blue.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [I judged that there might be a clue to develop martial arts in that authority, so…]
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  […I’m disappointed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  A giant snake emerged again from the Martial God’s form.
 </p>
 <p>
  It soon swallowed Dongbang Sak, who was sitting cross-legged.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What? Why is he suddenly eating him?’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was puzzled by this scene in Tuseong,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Forget again.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God gave this order while swallowing Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Along with this, the Martial God’s energy connected with the Constellation relics.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was mobilizing all his power to suppress Dongbang Sak’s strength again.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm… So that’s how he severs the connection point with Blue and reduces Martial Soul’s distortion.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, having grasped the general situation from watching the screen,
 </p>
 <p>
  [It seems it’s becoming increasingly impossible to control… As soon as the seal is broken, I’ll have to order him to retrieve the World Tree.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Could also roughly figure out when they would invade through the Martial God’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The seal was for 3 months, so there’s not much time left until it’s released.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Tuseong, which had been given a 3-month probation as punishment for summoning Jihan, the Constellation candidate.
 </p>
 <p>
  That period was now coming to an end.
 </p>
 <p>
  If Dongbang Sak invaded as soon as the seal was broken, he needed to prepare for this in advance.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Blue got a bit stronger thanks to that today… but the gap is still big.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recalled when Dongbang Sak fought the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although he had the Martial God’s support, he laid out Nine Palace Eight Trigrams all over Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even with a huge difference in power, he avoided all the precise carpet bombing of total annihilation.
 </p>
 <p>
  His movements were on a completely different level.
 </p>
 <p>
  To draw out the Taiji Sword against such an opponent,
 </p>
 <p>
  He needed to narrow the gap even more than now.
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There’s not enough time to catch up through training… and the most effective thing I can use right now is Administrator authority.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If he had known this would happen, he would have saved some instead of pouring it all into upgrading Blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan regretted spending it all when he had it and thought about ways to get more Administrator authority.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Giving up stats like Red or Eternity isn’t effective.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Giving up the two stats with high distortion would increase the daily incoming Administrator authority, but
 </p>
 <p>
  Right now, he needed immediate authority more than an increase in daily earnings.
 </p>
 <p>
  The time when Tuseong’s seal would be broken was approaching soon.
 </p>
 <p>
  After pondering for a while,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I guess there’s no choice. That’s the only way…’
 </p>
 <p>
  He opened the system and contacted the Green Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  [Senior.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Senior… Junior. What favor are you contacting me for?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You caught on quickly.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [There’s no way you’d be this polite if you didn’t have a favor to ask. You wouldn’t even contact me.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Quite perceptive.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, seeing Yggdrasil’s response, got straight to the point.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Is there no way to get more Administrator authority?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [I remember transferring a considerable amount of authority last time. I have nothing more to give.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Of course, I’m not asking for it for free like last time. I want to borrow it.]
 </p>
 <p>
  He was one of the last people he wanted to be indebted to, but
 </p>
 <p>
  Given the circumstances, he had no choice.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike GP, Administrator authority was a resource impossible to obtain from anywhere except other Administrators.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to borrow from him.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hmm… The red has disappeared from humanity, what do you need it for?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’re not asking to borrow authority without telling me what it’s for, are you? I don’t have an excess of authority either, you know.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You gave me a million each time when I was eliminating the Red factor.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [That was an investment to eliminate my political rival. Well, he seems to still be hiding somewhere…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Yggdrasil speculated that the Red Administrator was still alive somewhere, and continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  [So, why do you want to borrow it?]Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dongbang Sak, who subdued the Red Administrator, is about to invade Earth on the Martial God’s orders.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Why is he invading? Didn’t you make a peace agreement with the Martial God? There’s no need for him to attack you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Strictly speaking, it’s retrieving the red World Tree, not an invasion.
 </p>
 <p>
  But,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I probably shouldn’t mention the red World Tree in front of Yggdrasil.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The red World Tree that eliminates the void.
 </p>
 <p>
  If Yggdrasil learned that such an item was on Earth,
 </p>
 <p>
  The next invaders might be the World Tree Alliance rather than Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  That would be like avoiding the wolf only to call the tiger.
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s no need to bring this up here.
 </p>
 <p>
  [It seems Dongbang Sak is hard to control, so they want to use this chance to get rid of him along with me.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hmm…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [So, is a loan possible?]
 </p>

 <p>
  [It’s possible. About 100,000. The interest is 1% per day.]
 </p>
 <p>
  1% per day?
 </p>
 <p>
  Isn’t this outright robbery?
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hey, no deal.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Oh my. Seeing you immediately switch to informal speech, I guess the deal is off?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yeah, with 1% per day, I can’t even pay the interest.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [But if you satisfy my curiosity, I could lend it without interest.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Was this the real goal all along?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought this, but still,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Is that so? What are you curious about?]
 </p>
 <p>
  He sent a polite message again.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I like how quickly your attitude changes.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’re too kind. Please, ask whatever you’re curious about.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your face. I noticed it had recovered a bit last time… How did you do it?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned at this message.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He’s got good eyes.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He immediately noticed the slight recovery from contact with the red World Tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I definitely shouldn’t say more about the World Tree.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The red World Tree that deletes the void.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he learns it’s under the Earth’s sea, the World Tree Alliance would surely launch a massive invasion here.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought for a moment, then found something to answer with.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The restoration ability of Blue. Let’s pretend I’ve gained it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Severance and restoration of distortions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of these two functions he had realized were Blue’s abilities, he hadn’t properly used the latter yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  But well, he’d figure it out someday.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan pretended he had learned it in advance and sent him a nonchalant message.
 </p>
 <p>
  [As I gained insight into Blue’s authority, I got a bit of a hint. So it recovered a little.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Blue has the ability to eliminate the void?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [It worked very slightly, but hasn’t progressed since then.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [I see… Wow. That’s amazing. An ability to eliminate the void. If you develop that, it could become as groundbreaking an authority as the Red Administrator’s ‘Hell’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  No. Why are you praising it so much?
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s burdensome for the person who lied.
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s still in its infancy.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan sent a message downplaying it, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Where did it disappear from? Alright. I’ll invest this time too.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [By invest, you mean…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You don’t have to pay it back.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Oh…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Just stay alive. If you die here, it means one method of removing the void disappears.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Yggdrasil seemed to value this highly.
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, instead of lending authority,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Green Administrator ‘Yggdrasil’ transfers 200,000 Administrator authority.]
 </p>
 <p>
  He transferred twice the amount he asked for.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…I need to turn this lie into truth.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If Yggdrasil found out his words were false, the Green Administrator’s side won’t stay quiet.
 </p>
 <p>
  Blue’s restoration ability.
 </p>
 <p>
  He needed to figure it out somehow.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Still, I’ve gained the power to prepare for Dongbang Sak for now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to deal with the immediate problem first and
 </p>
 <p>
  Sent him a message.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Thank you for helping me again, senior. Thanks to you, I should be able to handle him.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Good. Let’s meet after you finish this. I really want to see Blue’s void-eliminating ability with my own eyes.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Understood. I’ll contact you after I’ve dealt with this matter.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan calmly responded to the proposal to meet in person, then ended the message exchange with Yggdrasil.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Phew… Somehow I managed to end it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s good that he got 200,000 authority, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  Even after dealing with Dongbang Sak, this matter will be a problem.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Blue that restores the void… There’s no rest, is there.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Blue’s restoration ability.
 </p>
 <p>
  But how to figure that out?
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s not enough time to train now.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was thinking about this,
 </p>
 <p>
  [10 minutes have passed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Beep.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the screen showing Tuseong turned off with that message, a thought occurred to him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Ah, right.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The long training period with no end in sight.
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s someone who can shorten this, isn’t there?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Since I’ve received authority support, I should use Dongbang Sak’s talent.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If he sharply lower Martial Soul like before, Dongbang Sak might be given another chance to train.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then there might be a situation where Blue develops too.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Lower Martial Soul’s distortion.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Lowering the abnormally increased Martial Soul distortion…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan began to immediately use the Administrator authority he had received.

  Chapter 490
 </p>
 <p>
  A few days later.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Huh, Blue… What kind of ability is it, to have taken such deep roots in Dongbang Sak?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God sighed as he observed the rapid changes in Martial Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  The moment he swallowed Dongbang Sak to eliminate Blue, Dongbang Sak’s Martial Soul decreased beyond what he could tolerate.
 </p>
 <p>
  And in the process of restoring it, those blue light swords always appeared one by one.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I thought it might be external interference, but there was no change when I just swallowed him…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The changes in Dongbang Sak were so drastic that,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God had conducted various tests to see if there was any external influence.
 </p>
 <p>
  But Dongbang Sak’s power only decreased when he tried to remove Blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  At this point, he had to acknowledge that Blue was closely connected to Martial Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  […After doing this ten times, it’s not working.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I’m sorry, Martial God.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Enough. Any more would be a waste of power.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God looked up at the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  The darkness that had sealed Tuseong was now gradually fading.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The time is almost here, so maintain your full power. Use that power to uproot the World Tree and return.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God’s red eyes glowed as he watched Dongbang Sak bow his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Afterwards, I must kill him for certain.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak, who had become closely connected to Blue, was truly a ticking time bomb that could explode at any moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  He’ll use him this one last time, then dispose of him.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God made this decision and waited for the seal to break.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Martial God. If… Seong Jihan comes to stop us, how should we deal with that?”DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Blue Administrator?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Why would he come to stop us? The red World Tree is mine. I’m just retrieving my property from Earth.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God retorted as if he didn’t understand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Regardless, Earth is his domain. I asked because he might respond if we invade.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hmm… That could be possible. Then politely ask for his understanding, saying we’re just coming to retrieve one item.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Politely ask for understanding, you say?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. There’s no need to clash with him unnecessarily.]
 </p>
 <p>
  He truly didn’t want to engage in conflict with Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God sincerely thought this.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There are so many targets to conquer in the universe…’
 </p>
 <p>
  From the perspective of the Martial God, who could now engage in external activities, appetizing planets were scattered everywhere.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not only the dragon race that had lost the Dragon Lord,
 </p>
 <p>
  But there were also many races struggling in the Silver and Gold leagues without proper leaders.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the Martial God had the power to conquer them alone.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There’s no need to waste power fighting an Administrator.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Beasts fighting each other would only result in mutual injury.
 </p>
 <p>
  The wise decision was to ignore each other and focus on prey.
 </p>
 <p>
  So the Martial God ordered that if Seong Jihan noticed, they should politely ask for his understanding.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But… if he still blocks us, what should we do then?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Why would he block us? I really don’t understand. We’ll politely request to retrieve my property and withdraw quietly, so why?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…The Administrator’s hometown is also near the World Tree. If we uproot it, won’t his land be affected too?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hometown… Would he still cling to such things after becoming an Administrator?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just in case… I want to know how to act.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God’s red eyes flashed as he looked down at Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing him talk back like this, it seemed he was certain Seong Jihan would interfere.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a situation the Martial God couldn’t comprehend at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  […If such a situation arises, I’ll try to persuade him myself.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God said this, but even then, he doubted Seong Jihan would actually act that way.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  In the training room of the penthouse.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s disappointing that it ended like this.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan couldn’t hide his disappointment as he watched the Martial God stop controlling Dongbang Sak’s power.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I lowered Martial Soul by 10 ten times, so I used a total of 50,000 Administrator authority.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan had used 25% of what he received from the Green Administrator for ability control.
 </p>
 <p>
  But he didn’t regret this at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s because,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stat ‘Blue’ and Martial Soul now have a clear connection point.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stat ‘Blue’ grade rises to S rank.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The grade of stat Blue had risen from A to S.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">

 <p>
  ‘Originally it would have required 20 million authority… but I upgraded it with just 50,000.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Proxy training through Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  This effect was tremendous.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the process of him recovering the reduced Martial Soul,
 </p>
 <p>
  The connection point between stat Blue and Martial Soul always developed anew.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, for Dongbang Sak, this ability’s connection was reset each time as the distortion decreased.
 </p>
 <p>
  But Seong Jihan, as the Blue Administrator, could retain and use this development fully.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Now I can definitely fight properly.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzzing…
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan replayed the video of Dongbang Sak fighting the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  Last time he watched it, he wondered how he could ever beat that old man.
 </p>
 <p>
  But now he felt he could somewhat contend with him.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the fusion of Blue and Martial Soul deepened, the two had become almost one.
 </p>
 <p>
  His power was clearly much different compared to when he first watched the video.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s all thanks to Dongbang Sak.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Expressing gratitude to Dongbang Sak who had trained Blue in his stead,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was analyzing him in the video once again.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle~ You were here. Did I get MVP again today?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah entered the training room with a bright expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “MVP?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, we had a Space League match today. Didn’t you watch?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I haven’t had time to pay attention to that lately. Isn’t humanity doing well anyway?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right. Because the world’s #1 ranked Yoon Seah is here!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, who had risen to world rank 1 after Seong Jihan became an Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  She couldn’t completely fill the void left by Seong Jihan in humanity’s representative team.
 </p>
 <p>
  But she was leading the team to victory with her powerful strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, you know. I think my Late Bloomer might rank up again… Oh, but Uncle. Are you watching this video again? I thought this old man’s fighting was on a different level, so it wasn’t helpful as reference…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, I might have to fight Dongbang Sak soon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What, really? Didn’t the Martial God say he wouldn’t invade?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, strictly speaking, he’s not coming to invade.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Their goal was merely to take the World Tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan had learned through spying on Tuseong that the Martial God truly had no intention of fighting him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If uprooting the World Tree had no side effects, I would have just given it to them.’
 </p>
 <p>
  But unfortunately, it was under the West Sea.
 </p>
 <p>
  And he learned that uprooting it would cause an earthquake that would split Seoul, and The Great Golems would emerge from there.
 </p>
 <p>
  He couldn’t just let them uproot it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh… The future Mom saw. That’s it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s explanation, Yoon Seah showed a worried expression, seeming to have heard something from Seong Jiah.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, we have to stop it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle, should I help too?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You? You’d be cut down in 1 second. Sorry, but you’d only be a hindrance.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh… Even as the world’s #1 ranked, I’m completely useless?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Against Dongbang Sak, yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan said this while pointing at the video he was watching.
 </p>
 <p>
  It showed Dongbang Sak piercing through the Red Administrator’s barrier.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I see. Even an Administrator ended up like that. It would be tough even if my Late Bloomer rank went up from SSS.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your Late Bloomer rank can go up from there?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Come to think of it, she did mention earlier that her rank might go up again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at Yoon Seah with renewed surprise.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This Late Bloomer gift is completely broken.’
 </p>
 <p>
  SSS rank was already considered a huge potential, but
 </p>
 <p>
  It could grow even beyond that?
 </p>
 <p>
  Did that mean it becomes an EX-rank gift?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well… Originally it was thought to be impossible because you needed to reach world rank 1 and get 5 MVPs in the Space League. Since you were growing at super-high speed, Uncle.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But it became possible because I stepped away as an Administrator?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. I immediately inherited the world rank 1, and with today’s MVP, I cleared the 5 MVP condition too. So I came to the training room to try ranking up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Try ranking it up. I’m curious to see how far it goes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s words, Yoon Seah immediately raised her Late Bloomer rank.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Behind her, a strong void energy intensely flared up.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘At this level… it’s more powerful than expected.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s eyes shone as he observed the power she was emitting.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Yoon Seah was humanity’s rank 1, she was still just a player.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  But the power she was emitting now was similar to what a lower-level Constellation might show.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Still, it doesn’t change the fact that Dongbang Sak would cut her down in 1 second.’
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how much stronger she’d become, it wasn’t enough to bring her to fight Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  The opponent was a monster who could easily sweep away even high-level Constellations.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was better for Yoon Seah to stay safely at home.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh… It says I’ve become a ‘Great Vessel of the Void’. My gift changed to ‘Great Vessel of the Void’ too. EX-rank!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So Late Bloomer has finally completed. But why the void… Why that direction?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Probably because I’ve been handling void energy, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah answered while curiously tapping her system window here and there.
 </p>
 <p>
  As she was examining the new abilities she had gained,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle, can I try absorbing some of the void from your face?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s such a function?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, it’s in the characteristics of the Great Vessel of the Void. I’m curious how it works.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She made a request to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sure, go ahead. But don’t absorb too much.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The more void removed from his face the better, but right now he needed it for fighting Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan answered and pointed to his face with his finger.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay. Is this how I do it…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah brought her hand closer with an uncertain expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  A faint purple smoke seemed to rise from her hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The void began to be sucked from Seong Jihan’s face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This seems to be absorbing more than I thought?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh. Wh-what, a lot is coming in. I’ll stop!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Yoon Seah hastily pulled her hand away, a message appeared before Seong Jihan’s eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stat ‘Void’ decreases by 5.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The void decreased by 5 just from her touching it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Great Vessel of the Void… Its absorption power is better than expected.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Was this worthy of being called an EX-rank characteristic?
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was thinking this,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, Uncle. Your face looks better? The cracks have filled in!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah exclaimed in surprise, pointing at his face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. Look in the mirror!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh… It’s true.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at his face in the mirror in the training room.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Where?”
 </p>
 <p>
  He tilted his head in confusion.
 </p>
 <p>
  The face reflected in the mirror looked the same as usual.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, look. Here, here. The cracks along your jawline have decreased, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah seemed to see a difference.
 </p>
 <p>
  She precisely pointed out Seong Jihan’s jaw.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, you’re right. It has decreased a little.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A change so subtle that even he had trouble noticing it.
 </p>
 <p>
  But it was clear that the cracks on his face had improved.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Even when I used the Taiji Sword and consumed void, these cracks didn’t heal…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Great Vessel of the Void that Yoon Seah had just obtained.
 </p>
 <p>
  This gift’s performance was even better than expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This… The Green Administrator would covet this if he knew.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Green Administrator, who had great interest in eliminating the void.
 </p>
 <p>
  If she learned how effective the Great Vessel of the Void was, he might set his eyes on Earth.
 </p>
 <p>
  This must be kept secret no matter what.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, you absolutely must not tell anyone about this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “R-really? I was going to brag about it on BattleTube…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even the permanent administrators are interested in eliminating the void. If this fact gets out, you might get kidnapped.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… I understand. I’ll keep my mouth shut tight.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah nodded as Seong Jihan earnestly implored her.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good. And… congratulations on completing your vessel.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehe, this is all thanks to you becoming an Administrator, Uncle. Thank you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She smiled brightly, returning the congratulations.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment,
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzzing…
 </p>
 <p>
  Above Yoon Seah’s head, a purple haze rose up.
 </p>
 <p>
  It soon coalesced, forming a single shape.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…That’s.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Something Seong Jihan had seen many times before.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The hat the Arena Owner used to wear.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A black fedora.

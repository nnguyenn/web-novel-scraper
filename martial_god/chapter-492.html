  Chapter 492
 </p>
 <p>
  10 minutes earlier.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan waited with his arms crossed,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  He felt a light flash on his forehead.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This Divine Eye… it only activates here, huh.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Last time it showed the World Tree’s head falling off here too.
 </p>
 <p>
  What was it this time?
 </p>
 <p>
  As he waited for the scene the Divine Eye would show,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ziiing…
 </p>
 <p>
  The surrounding scenery changed, and images of Seong Jihan and Dongbang Sak began appearing here and there.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though dozens of images of the two fiercely battling were spread around at a glance,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…I die in quite diverse ways.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The battle results were all Seong Jihan’s defeat.
 </p>
 <p>
  His head flying off, multiple light swords piercing his chest, etc.
 </p>
 <p>
  The battle between the two foreseen by the Divine Eye
 </p>
 <p>
  Ended in 100% Seong Jihan’s death.
 </p>
 <p>
  Beep…
 </p>
 <p>
  After showing scenes of his death for a while, the Divine Eye turned off.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…How unlucky to show this right before fighting.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan muttered without realizing.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Divine Eye given by Pythia.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wouldn’t activate when he tried before, but now it only showed him dying at a time like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Of course, the future seen by the Divine Eye can always change, but…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even considering that, seeing only scenes of death en masse suggests the battle will be unfavorable.
 </p>
 <p>
  He prepared countermeasures as much as possible, but was this still not enough?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Looks like… I’ll have to turn on the BattleTube too.’
 </p>
 <p>
  After seeing himself die, Seong Jihan decided to turn on the BattleTube he wasn’t going to use.
 </p>
 <p>
  Actually, with the supernova gone, the Star Buff’s performance had worsened.
 </p>
 <p>
  And he wasn’t going to use this because he was worried Yoon Seah might become a Void Apostle trying to help after watching the broadcast.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But seeing myself die so miserably, I guess I need to mobilize everything.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking that, Seong Jihan turned on the BattleTube.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh… a broadcast after so long
 </p>
 <p>
  -I was disappointed you weren’t streaming games after becoming Administrator haha. A live stream after a long time.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But if you don’t stream regular games, how will you level up?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Does level even matter for an Administrator;
 </p>
 <p>
  -For real, he’s already as big as he can get
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers flooded in seeing Seong Jihan’s live stream after a long time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Now the Star Buff feels like it increases power by about 10%.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan clearly felt the Star Buff’s performance had dropped compared to before.
 </p>
 <p>
  Maybe it was because of the Administrator ability being involved.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Star Buff’s effect was lower than the originally indicated buff efficiency.
 </p>
 <p>
  But still, even 10% was precious against Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll keep it on.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking that, Seong Jihan slowly opened his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s been a while, everyone. Today I’ll be welcoming a guest here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  -?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Guest?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Isn’t this above the sea right now…?
 </p>
 <p>
  -What kind of guest would come to a place like that?
 </p>
 <p>
  As viewers were puzzled by Seong Jihan’s words,
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The sky split in half, and Dongbang Sak revealed himself from within.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Whoa, that old man… Isn’t he the one who fought the Red Administrator?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yeah, the person we saw when spectating last time
 </p>
 <p>
  -But what’s with the snake helmet on his head lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -Isn’t he a monster who doesn’t need things like helmets…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is that person the guest? This seems ominous
 </p>
 <p>
  -Didn’t the Martial God say he wouldn’t invade;
 </p>
 <p>
  As viewers wondered why Dongbang Sak appeared there,
 </p>
 <p>
  “You were already waiting… Did you know I was coming?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak stroked his beard as he looked at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is the Administrator’s domain, so I can know everything.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Though in reality it was the result of spying using Administrator authority,
 </p>
 <p>
  He answered calmly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “More importantly, you’re wearing a helmet I haven’t seen before.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan said that pointing at the snake head,
 </p>
 <p>
  [A helmet. He doesn’t need such things.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Hiss…
 </p>
 <p>
  Dark red smoke poured out from there, and an eerie voice was heard.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You, are you the Martial God?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s right, Blue Administrator.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why did you come here? I thought you had no intention of fighting me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I still have no intention of being hostile to you. However.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Red-black light flashed in the snake’s eyes.
 </p>

 <p>
  [I’ve merely come to retrieve my item that I left here.]
 </p>

 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  -What item?
 </p>
 <p>
  -So…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Just go away already, seriously
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why are they so desperate to keep bothering us…
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers, realizing the opponent was the Martial God, showed signs of disgust.
 </p>
 <p>
  After sucking Earth dry, what more are they trying to take?
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You mean the Red World Tree.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s right. You already knew.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan specified the item, the Martial God continued as if pleased.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I’ll just uproot that and withdraw quietly.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Quietly, he said.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hearing those words, Seong Jihan smirked and pointed at the sea.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you uproot the World Tree, won’t this land be greatly shaken and evil spirits emerge?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hmm… How did you know that?]
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan tapped his forehead, the Martial God quickly understood the gesture.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Divine Eye, is it? I thought Pythia’s signal had disappeared, but you absorbed it.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well. Something like that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Though in fact it was given by the other side.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan saw no need to tell the truth, so he glossed over it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, unlike before, the snake’s eyes flashed with pure white light.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He’s using the Divine Eye in that form.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Ziiing…
 </p>
 <p>
  After surveying the sea once with the Divine Eye,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whatever he saw, the Martial God spoke to Seong Jihan in an even more imposing voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you have the Divine Eye, you should know. You cannot defeat Dongbang Sak.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I wonder. If the future always followed the Divine Eye, I wouldn’t have survived Tuseong, would I?”
 </p>
 <p>
  […Do you really intend to fight?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you go back home now, I have no need to fight either.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan said that pointing at the sky, the pure white light disappeared from the snake’s eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Fine. It’s your loss. I’ll compensate you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Compensate for my loss? How?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [For the humans who will actually suffer damage… Let’s say 2 billion generously. I’ll compensate 10,000 GP per person.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Martial God calculated the damage compensation at 10,000 GP per person,
 </p>
 <p>
  -10,000 GP per person…?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Our lives are worth 10 million won…?
 </p>
 <p>
  -That’s 12 million won at current exchange rates…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Sigh… Is he really crazy
 </p>
 <p>
  -But why would 2 billion people suffer damage from uprooting the World Tree;
 </p>
 <p>
  -Where exactly is this location anyway…
 </p>
 <p>
  The chat reactions became intense, with more opinions wanting to know the exact sea location.
 </p>
 <p>
  Saying 2 billion would suffer damage implies the range is very wide.
 </p>
 <p>
  [200 trillion GP should be enough to compensate for your loss. What do you think?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, the Martial God, seeming to think this price calculation was reasonable, proposed the compensation amount to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I refuse.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […In addition to this, I’ll wait here for 7 days. That should be enough time to evacuate people.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Giving a week to flee far from the great earthquake that will occur in the West Sea?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Talking about 2 billion implies the effects reach China, but where are Koreans supposed to run to?’
 </p>
 <p>
  If China was in range, Japan probably was too.
 </p>
 <p>
  To survive the aftermath of the World Tree being uprooted, Koreans would really have to cross the Pacific Ocean.
 </p>
 <p>
  But how could everyone evacuate in just a week?
 </p>
 <p>
  “I refuse.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […I’ve conceded plenty, yet you refuse even this. Blue Administrator, I truly cannot understand you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Hiss…
 </p>
 <p>
  The snake form gradually faded.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Negotiations have broken down. Dongbang Sak. Kill him and bring the World Tree.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Just before disappearing, the order to kill Seong Jihan was given.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood, my master.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak, after making a fist-palm salute,
 </p>
 <p>
  “My master conceded plenty, yet you still choose to fight.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Spoke regretfully as he looked at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Because I’m confident I can deal with you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Deal with, you say.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  As Dongbang Sak raised his hand,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash! Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  Light swords began forming around him one by one.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Since you chose to fight for your homeland, I’ll give you one piece of advice.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Advice… What is it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  To Seong Jihan’s question,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t try to deal with me, try to defeat me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak slowly lowered his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Otherwise, it will end quickly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The dozens of light swords that had formed began firing all at once.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *

 </div>
 <p>
  He had run simulations many times.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had perfectly analyzed the video of Dongbang Sak fighting the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  And searched for ways to counter him here.
 </p>
 <p>
  But one thing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Actually facing him directly.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was clearly a different dimension.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hah. My arm’s gone again.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Slash…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned as he saw his right arm fly off.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, the severed arm quickly regenerated with the power of Eternity, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘How many times have my limbs been cut off now?’
 </p>
 <p>
  5 minutes into clashing with Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was being overwhelmed, making his preparations seem meaningless.
 </p>
 <p>
  His arms and legs had already been cut off and regenerated dozens of times.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stat Eternity decreases by 1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Eternity stat that regenerated his body had already decreased by 1.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was pushed back similarly when fighting the Martial God before, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  Back then he was crushed by overwhelming power difference, this time he was losing in Martial Soul utilization.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your movements are quite good.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, Dongbang Sak showed composure as he stroked his beard and praised Seong Jihan while facing him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But… if that’s all you have, you won’t last long.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash! Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  More and more light swords formed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The swords surrounding Seong Jihan now numbered 50.
 </p>
 <p>
  These swords were only the size of ordinary longswords, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each one demonstrated devastating power every time it flashed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ve faced Twin Swords before from brother-in-law, but…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sword King Yoon Sejin had also used Twin Swords before.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the difference between those and Dongbang Sak’s swords was like heaven and earth.
 </p>
 <p>
  No, even greater than that.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  With each flash of a light sword,
 </p>
 <p>
  The sea split and the atmosphere shook.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow look at the sea splitting, that’s insane…
 </p>
 <p>
  -You can see the seabed; What is that
 </p>
 <p>
  -Where exactly is this location?
 </p>
 <p>
  -They say they found the location by satellite… It’s the center of the West Sea
 </p>
 <p>
  -West Sea? Should we evacuate;
 </p>
 <p>
  -They say flights to America are already sold out?
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, people who had found out Seong Jihan and Dongbang Sak’s clash location through military satellites,
 </p>
 <p>
  Were in great confusion.
 </p>
 <p>
  The estimated 2 billion affected population was a number that could only be reached if China, Japan, and Korea were all within range and beyond,
 </p>
 <p>
  So not just Korea, but all of Northeast Asia was in an uproar watching this broadcast, wondering if they needed to evacuate.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though Seong Jihan was in a completely disadvantageous position even to third-party observers during that brief clash,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Now, the time is almost here.’
 </p>
 <p>
  His eyes were not losing spirit, waiting for an opportunity.
 </p>
 <p>
  And reading such signs, Dongbang Sak,
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you have a hidden move, bring it out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Moved 52 light swords to surround Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sword encirclement seemed to have many gaps at first glance, but each one had the power to split heaven and earth.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed impossible to escape by just sacrificing limbs like before.
 </p>
 <p>
  And soon,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ziiing…
 </p>
 <p>
  As light spread from the swords, the surroundings began to be covered in the pattern of the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams.
 </p>
 <p>
  Like when he subdued the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak’s sword formation trying to perfectly subdue the opponent without leaving any escape.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Otherwise, this will be the end.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As he stroked his beard, saying leisurely,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  A taiji symbol rose behind Seong Jihan’s back.
 </p>
 <p>
  He drew out the Taiji Sword that had been stained with darkness.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You clearly said to try to defeat you earlier, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Taiji Sword that he hadn’t drawn once during the 5 minutes of battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing this, Dongbang Sak’s eyebrows twitched.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I did. But you couldn’t even deal with me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now, I’ll defeat you with this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Very well. Show me. I was curious about your Taiji Sword.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Dongbang Sak showed a curious reaction seeing the Taiji Sword completely different from his own,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan grinned.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Before that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “System, lower the Martial Soul’s distortion level to 40.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As his order fell,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The light swords instantly froze and disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams formation that had perfectly surrounded Seong Jihan also collapsed on its own.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No. This is…”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Dongbang Sak was momentarily flustered by the sudden change in situation,
 </p>
 <p>
  Slash…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Taiji Sword split Dongbang Sak’s beard in half.

  Chapter 493
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Even when fighting the Red Administrator, my beard stayed intact.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak stroked his half-cut beard.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is the first time my beard has been cut like this in my entire life.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As he spoke, his hand moved toward the injured area behind the beard—his neck.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s also the first time I almost had my neck cut.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so? That’s unfortunate.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan swallowed his disappointment.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though his Taiji Sword had severed Dongbang Sak’s beard and injured his neck, it did not deliver a killing blow.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I took the shot perfectly when his formation collapsed…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Enduring his limbs being severed dozens of times over 5 minutes had been solely to seize this opportunity.
 </p>
 <p>
  He waited for Dongbang Sak to fully deploy his formation and attempt to suppress him, only to counterattack using his Administrative Authority.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The plan worked flawlessly, but he evaded the critical strike.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching Dongbang Sak’s beard quickly regenerate to its original length, Seong Jihan furrowed his brow.
 </p>
 <p>
  When his sword had made contact, he was certain he had struck true.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He’s incredibly quick to react.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He had even forgotten his objective to draw out the Taiji Sword, aiming for a decisive strike instead.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But how exactly did you manage it? My power suddenly diminished.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak expressed his suspicion, noting that his light swords had reduced to 40.
 </p>
 <p>
  “And this sensation… it feels reminiscent of the restraint I experienced under the Martial God.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan shrugged with a nonchalant face.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, the snake’s form projected from Dongbang Sak’s head again.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you do this…?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God’s voice thundered in fury.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I suspected all along… you interfered with my attempts to erase traces of Blue!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t understand what you’re saying.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan denied with a shrug.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Because of you, I wasted my efforts and power…! Dongbang Sak, take him down!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God, already convinced Seong Jihan was the culprit, gave the stern order.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak, whose hand had been stroking his once-divided beard, now focused his gaze on Seong Jihan’s Taiji Sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can you keep using the Taiji Sword?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course. It’s more than enough for an old man like you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The 40 light swords hovering behind Dongbang Sak started to merge.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not merging into one like the Taiji Sword.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The 40 swords combined to form a colossal beam of light.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Dongbang Sak quietly observed it,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s fight with this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In the blink of an eye, he closed the distance to Seong Jihan, who raised his Taiji Sword to block the attack,
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the beam’s attack was blocked,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Tsk…!”Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  The light energy surging from the beam threatened to overwhelm him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan quickly retreated, expanding the reach of his Taiji Sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  A black sword emerged, effectively shielding him from the attack.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘At least the Taiji Sword can hold them off.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak’s power was still formidable, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  The situation had slightly improved with the Taiji Sword and reduced distortion of the Martial Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh…
 </p>
 <p>
  -He’s holding his ground!
 </p>
 <p>
  -Can he win? Can he do it?
 </p>
 <p>
  -It’s too late to board a plane and escape; he has to win, no matter what..
 </p>
 <p>
  -I just cleaned out the convenience store, please win so I can get a refund …
 </p>
 <p>
  -So that’s why; all the ramen was gone when I went to the store.
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers, noticing Seong Jihan’s resilience, started to harbor hope.
 </p>
 <p>
  The clash between the two was equally intense.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swords clashing against light beams countless times,
 </p>
 <p>
  The sea level dropped dramatically from the evaporated seawater.
 </p>
 <p>
  If this were on land, everything would have been annihilated.
 </p>
 <p>
  To the casual observer, it seemed like an even battle where neither side held an advantage.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…This isn’t easy. Truly.’
 </p>
 <p>
  While exchanging blows with Dongbang Sak, Seong Jihan realized he was outmatched.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even with the Administrative Authority reducing his power, the Star Buff activated, and using the Taiji Sword to its fullest,
 </p>
 <p>
  The opponent only grew stronger as they continued to exchange blows.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite feeling increasingly outmatched, Seong Jihan pressed on.
 </p>

 <p>
  On the other hand,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aren’t you going to use Blue?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak asked, with a composed expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well… you have to keep some trump cards in reserve.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In actuality, Blue’s destructive power had not yet surpassed the Taiji Sword, so he hadn’t used it.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan feigned nonchalance, Dongbang Sak’s lips curled up slightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so? Then I’ll use mine first.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Martial Soul’s distortion increases by 3.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as the message appeared,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash…!
 </p>
 <p>
  A sword formed from blue and white light shot towards Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No…!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Cutting through the void of the Taiji Sword, the light beam struck Seong Jihan’s face precisely in the left eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  Slash!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the blue and white blade pierced his left eye,
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s already fractured face began to crumble and disintegrate.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Completely shattered.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan felt the void surge from his destroyed face.
 </p>
 <p>
  The dam he had barely managed to hold had now burst all at once.
 </p>
 <p>
  His surroundings filled with a purple mist.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It helped block Dongbang Sak’s attack, though.’
 </p>
 <p>
  His left face, the sealed void processer, had absorbed Dongbang Sak’s sword, leaving only darkness behind.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fortunately, the void had not yet consumed Seong Jihan’s entire body.
 </p>
 <p>
  But he knew if he let his guard down, it could easily spread and dissolve his form.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘My left eye, how can I still see?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite his face being engulfed in darkness, strangely, his vision remained unimpeded.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan was pondering over this,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak’s next attack swiftly targeted his left face again.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Would hitting the same spot again be acceptable?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Chiiik…!
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan blocked the attack with his sword, Dongbang Sak observed him with curiosity.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even with no eye, you seem to see just fine.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Indeed. I see clearly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s vision bizarrely remained intact despite the void engulfing his shattered eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  While he pondered this,
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak pointed at Seong Jihan’s ruined eye with a finger.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But that void. What’ll you do about it? It’ll devour your body if you leave it as is.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re quite considerate for an adversary.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It would be a pity to end the fight like this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s no need to worry.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Chiiik…
 </p>
 <p>
  Around Seong Jihan’s void-filled eye, a blue border began to appear.
 </p>
 <p>
  An aura of Blue formed a boundary.
 </p>
 <p>
  Possessing the power of severance, it effectively prevented the void from encroaching further upon Seong Jihan’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I just need to redraw the boundary.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is using Blue as a boundary your trump card?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not quite.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan then commanded the system.
 </p>
 <p>
  “System, lock the Marital Soul’s distortion at 40. Continuously.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At his command,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The stream of power started to drain from the beam of light.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  And upon seeing this, Dongbang Sak’s brow furrowed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So it was you. Is this an administrative command?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just a little something I have.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “40… That’s my power before I trained. So, confining it to this level is your strategy?”
 </p>
 <p>
  He was sharp. Not just skilled in martial arts, but quick-witted too.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was somewhat taken aback by how swiftly Dongbang Sak pieced together the puzzle.
 </p>
 <p>
  How was he to win against someone like this?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh no…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Seong Jihan’s face is gone?
 </p>
 <p>
  -I was already on edge with the cracks; now it’s completely swallowed by darkness…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is he about to die?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Hey, he hasn’t lost yet…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Damn, can’t you stop with the jinxes?
 </p>
 <p>
  -But it’s looking so grim ㅡㅡ;;
 </p>
 <p>
  Many viewers seemed to share the same feeling, acknowledging the odds were against Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  The shattered face and the encroaching void, now barely held in check by Blue, seemed like a sign of impending defeat.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  “Since my face is already broken, I’ll use the void to its fullest.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The power of the Taiji Sword surged, pushing against the beam of light.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Indeed. The sword has grown stronger!”
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, Dongbang Sak retreated for the first time in the clash,
 </p>
 <p>
  His eyes gleaming with interest.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But your movements are still slow…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Before he even finished speaking.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  Again, the Taiji Sword sliced through Dongbang Sak’s beard.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Blood spurted from his throat as the sword brushed past it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hooo…”
 </p>
 <p>
  But as Dongbang Sak retreated and rubbed his neck,
 </p>
 <p>
  The wound healed instantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  His regeneration ability was impressive.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No apparent weaknesses.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan pressed on with the Taiji Sword,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Remarkable. Your movements have improved!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak calmly parried the attack.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, unlike before,
 </p>
 <p>
  The strengthened Taiji Sword, enhanced by the void, started to gnaw away at Dongbang Sak’s light.
 </p>
 <p>
  For a moment, Seong Jihan held the upper hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Dongbang Sak, it’s thanks to you.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial Soul distortion increased by 3 due to Dongbang Sak’s earlier empowerment.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Martial Soul and Blue form a strong connection.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s Blue advanced further, increasing the efficiency of Martial Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘You trained me at Tuseong, and you’re doing it again here.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, it had come at the cost of his face being shattered this time.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the battle now felt more manageable.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just when the gap seemed to narrow, thanks to Dongbang Sak,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… I think I can compress this now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The beam of light held by Dongbang Sak began to shrink.
 </p>
 <p>
  What formed was a gigantic light sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though it was smaller than when it was still a beam,
 </p>
 <p>
  The precision and concentration of energy within it were greatly enhanced.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak, who had been pushed back, began to deal with Seong Jihan more effortlessly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Real-time comprehension.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Was this what talent in “Martial Arts” recognized universally looks like?
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead of recklessly unleashing his Taiji Sword, Dongbang Sak comprehended and compressed his own light to create a formidable weapon.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as Seong Jihan was contemplating how to draw out the Taiji Sword,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Martial Soul’s distortion increases by 4.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Martial Soul and Blue form a strong connection.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A message indicating the increase in Martial Soul’s distortion appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is it… like before?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Reacting on instinct, Seong Jihan infused his sword with Blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  A combined burst of blue and white light exploded right in front of his Taiji Sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You blocked Blue with Blue.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is my ability. Such ambushes won’t work again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, two blue-white light swords had been blocked.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks to the distortion message, Seong Jihan had managed to defend against an attack similar to the one that had shattered his face.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  “It doesn’t seem entirely ineffective… The void on your face is expanding.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With Blue being used to block, the void continued to encroach upon Seong Jihan’s face.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, it had spread beyond his eye to his cheek.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Even if left alone, it will soon disappear… Blue Administrator, this is the result of your choice.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The previously vanished snake head reappeared, mocking Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Those who understood the gravity of the void saw Seong Jihan as nearing his end.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  “My body feels lighter, though.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan calmly amplified the power of his Taiji Sword, pushing Dongbang Sak back further.
 </p>
 <p>
  With Martial Soul’s distortion increased by 4, the connection with Blue strengthened, the battle which had been evenly matched began to favor Seong Jihan once more.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your movements have indeed improved… albeit suddenly…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Noticing this, Dongbang Sak’s eyes shone,
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s his final struggle. Dongbang Sak, continue this way and finish it.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God dismissed Seong Jihan’s newfound power as mere desperation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Continue this way…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak gazed at Seong Jihan with an enigmatic expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Understood. I will do so.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He nodded in agreement.

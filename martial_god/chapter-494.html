  Chapter 494
 </p>
 <p>
  -The battle is continuing into the night…
 </p>
 <p>
  -It seems like Seong Jihan is gaining the upper hand, but then it looks even again…
 </p>
 <p>
  -But he was initially being overpowered, so maybe he has a chance to win?
 </p>
 <p>
  The clash between Seong Jihan and Dongbang Sak had now continued into the night.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan’s face had been shattered not long after the fight began, many expected the battle to end quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Seong Jihan persevered, sometimes even overwhelming Dongbang Sak, continuing the fight.
 </p>
 <p>
  To a casual observer, it might seem like Seong Jihan had a slight upper hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But the darkness on his face is spreading too much…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Right, it’s now creeping over to his right side…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Every time that old man ambushes him, the darkness spreads further… Can he still hold on?
 </p>
 <p>
  The void had spread more extensively across his face.
 </p>
 <p>
  His shattered left face was now completely engulfed in void.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was even invading the right side of his face and extending below his neck.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, the stat Blue was barely sufficient to keep it in check.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He’s truly a monster.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought again what he had already thought dozens or even hundreds of times while fighting Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks to Dongbang Sak raising the distortion of his Martial Soul, Seong Jihan had now grown stronger,
 </p>
 <p>
  But this only highlighted the more pronounced gap in their martial skills.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how much the Taiji Sword was enhanced, it couldn’t sever through.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Taiji Sword had certainly grown stronger.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak’s sword of light had been shattered multiple times.
 </p>
 <p>
  His clothes and beard often vanished at the sword’s edge.
 </p>
 <p>
  But…
 </p>
 <p>
  -It was a decent attack.
 </p>
 <p>
  The wounds inflicted were just superficial.
 </p>
 <p>
  The broken sword of light would reappear.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the blue-white sword that emerged whenever Dongbang Sak gained insight strongly pressured Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…It’s not easy. There’s no clear answer.’
 </p>
 <p>
  When under the focused onslaught of the Wandering Martial God at Tuseong, it was only due to his lack of power.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite having similar strengths now, he thought he could win if he had the power,
 </p>
 <p>
  But Dongbang Sak was different.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if he grew stronger here, could he possibly defeat him?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Dongbang Sak is the embodiment of a true Martial God.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The more they fought, the less he felt he could win.
 </p>
 <p>
  After gaining confidence through the development of his Martial Soul, Seong Jihan was certain.
 </p>
 <p>
  In terms of combat, he couldn’t win against Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Then, I need to make him use the Taiji Sword…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite breaking his sword of light, he still wouldn’t draw it.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan pondered how to make him draw the sword,
 </p>
 <p>
  Hiss…
 </p>
 <p>
  The form of a snake emerged once again from Dongbang Sak’s head.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dongbang Sak. What are you doing? Why are you being pushed back compared to before?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I apologize. His power keeps growing, so it’s not easy to suppress him.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Even so, you should win effortlessly. Is he not already submerged in the void?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Appearing again, the words spoken were instructions that ultimately held no substance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak must find it rather absurd listening to that.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan momentarily observed their conversation,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I will try harder. However, it is difficult to match his Taiji Sword with my current weapon… May I use the Taiji Sword?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak asked carefully if he could use the Taiji Sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Oh.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Was this how it ultimately plays out?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan momentarily anticipated upon hearing this.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Taiji Sword…]
 </p>
 <p>
  After pondering momentarily, the snake responded.
 </p>
 <p>
  [No. Do not draw that sword. He seems close to being consumed by the void, so wait for that moment.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The order was given not to draw the Taiji Sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It seemed he had no intention of drawing the Taiji Sword because that snake prevented him.’
 </p>
 <p>
  But why not allow him to draw it?
 </p>
 <p>
  Was there something limiting him?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Now that I think about it, Dongbang Sak seems to have noticed that my power is growing…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan glanced at the BattleTube’s playtime.
 </p>
 <p>
  [12:33]
 </p>
 <p>
  After fighting Dongbang Sak and growing stronger for more than half a day,
 </p>
 <p>
  It was understandable that someone as perceptive as Dongbang Sak would notice.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite noticing, he continued fighting the same way, not mentioning it.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was akin to intentionally ignoring Seong Jihan’s growing strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What is his aim here…?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Could he be going easy on him?
 </p>
 <p>
  But if that were the case…
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash…!
 </p>

 <p>
  [Martial Soul’s distortion increases by 4.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Martial Soul and Blue form a strong connection.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The blue-white sword that emerged from his light sword was exceedingly sharp.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he let his guard down even a little, it wouldn’t just be his face but his entire body that could be shattered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan infused Blue into his Taiji Sword to block the attack.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though the assault was fended off,
 </p>
 <p>
  Hiss…
 </p>
 <p>
  The void engulfing his face grew denser.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing this, Dongbang Sak stroked his beard.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The void completely engulfs your face. That handsome face of yours is now submerged in darkness.”𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yet you continue with those attacks.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Without the permission to use the Taiji Sword, the only method to defeat your growing strength is this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The look in Dongbang Sak’s eyes deepened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you do not handle it properly, I’ll keep using it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Try to block it once completely.
 </p>
 <p>
  So he could use the Taiji Sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak’s words implied that to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘For now, I can’t manifest Blue in both my face and sword at the same time…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The outpouring void from his face was too strong, making it burdensome just to block it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Through the system’s message, he barely managed to block Dongbang Sak’s attacks.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each time, the void on his face rapidly encroached his body.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even the stat Eternity decreased each time, now reduced to a single digit.
 </p>
 <p>
  But,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…If Martial Soul and Blue connect a few more times, it might be possible.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan instinctively knew.
 </p>
 <p>
  If Dongbang Sak continued this act,
 </p>
 <p>
  Martial Soul and Blue might merge.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Both his face and sword,
 </p>
 <p>
  Could utilize Blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nonetheless, the issue was…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…It’s becoming difficult to endure.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The flood of void was becoming unbearable.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if he tried to block with Blue, it had reached its limit.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If that’s the case, there’s only one option left.’
 </p>
 <p>
  While contemplating his last resort, Seong Jihan continued his fight.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash…!
 </p>
 <p>
  [Martial Soul’s distortion increases by 5.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Martial Soul and Blue form a strong connection.]
 </p>
 <p>
  With the message, another blue-white sword came flying.
 </p>
 <p>
  By shifting Blue to his sword, he somehow blocked the attack.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  However, as the void now overflowed from his face, it completely obscured his right eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Damn, it’s spreading faster than I anticipated…!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the void erupt, Seong Jihan gritted his teeth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The purplish mist started to engulf his entire body rapidly.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh… what’s happening…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is it… over?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Seong Jihan’s entire body is covered…
 </p>
 <p>
  The intense battle between Seong Jihan and Dongbang Sak reached an undesirable outcome for humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, completely swallowed by the void, appeared to be on the brink of death to any observer.
 </p>
 <p>
  The battle was already decided.
 </p>
 <p>
  -He even defeated the Blue Administrator…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Damn it, he has already subdued two Administrators.
 </p>
 <p>
  -The Red Administrator was not in perfect condition and the Blue Administrator is only temporary…
 </p>
 <p>
  -At this point, he could replace his master as the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  -What are you saying, he should be the Permanent Administrator with such monstrous feats.
 </p>
 <p>
  -They should seriously promote him as a Permanent Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, spectators from other planets, third parties in this matter, began unsubscribing from Seong Jihan’s channel and discussing the notion of promoting Dongbang Sak as the Permanent Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the other hand,
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak, with a somber gaze, looked at Seong Jihan submerged in the void.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The void has completely overflowed… Now, it will end even if left alone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He had held out long, yet he ultimately couldn’t overcome the void.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even after becoming the Blue Administrator, he fell without fully mastering his powers.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Even he couldn’t make it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  While Dongbang Sak lowered his sword and stroked his beard in silence,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dongbang Sak. What are you doing? Don’t be complacent, finish him immediately!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing Dongbang Sak’s leisure, the Martial God appeared once again, issuing a warning.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Understood, my master.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Dongbang Sak responded and raised his sword again,
 </p>
 <p>
  Zieeeng…!
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

 <p>
  A purple portal opened beside Seong Jihan covered in void.
 </p>
 <p>
  “U-Uncle…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah emerged from it.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wait… Why is Yoon Seah suddenly there?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Isn’t it dangerous there?;
 </p>
 <p>
  -Seriously…
 </p>
 <p>
  -If she stays, both will die…
 </p>
 <p>
  Amidst the confusion stemming from Yoon Seah’s sudden appearance,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Give… give me all the void! I’ll take it all…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  She, with tears welling up, tried to embrace Seong Jihan’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  But.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  A giant starfish appeared between her and Seong Jihan, blocking her.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Though you have accepted the candidate position, you can’t handle such an amount now. A void of that magnitude requires inheriting the cap. You must retreat…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shut up! I took the candidate position to absorb this void!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Can’t you see with your own eyes… The void is too vast to handle.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Step aside. Messenger.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I am not under your command. You cannot order me.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As Yoon Seah tried to hold onto Seong Jihan and as the Messenger blocked her,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God’s eyes flashed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dongbang Sak, she might become a variable. Kill her along with Seong Jihan.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Though Dongbang Sak seemed reluctant, he raised his sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Zieeng…
 </p>
 <p>
  The starfish immediately created a void-infused barrier and spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  [As you can see, it’s not possible now. We must escape!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m not leaving… I’ll absorb all of the void…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ha, you’ll be the worst superior at this rate. Really.]
 </p>
 <p>
  While the Messenger sighed at the stubborn Yoon Seah,
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Haa. You, for now, go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, I won’t go!.. Huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah reflexively started to refuse, before her tear-filled eyes widened in shock.
 </p>
 <p>
  That voice…
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s Uncle?
 </p>
 <p>
  [No way… You’ve survived that state?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Hearing that voice, the Messenger, also shocked, turned around.
 </p>
 <p>
  And there…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, I survived.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Was Seong Jihan, levitating calmly in the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  “U-U-Uncle, your face is… just like when you’re at home…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. Sigh… I told you not to accept the proposal no matter what.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing him fully recovered sighing at his niece who didn’t listen,
 </p>
 <p>
  “But…! How could I stand by while you were being consumed by the void…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah responded with frustration.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Messenger, did you bring Yoon Seah here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes, it was a condition of her accepting the candidate position. She wished to come here.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Take her back home.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle, even if I don’t absorb the void…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Am I not alright now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing Seong Jihan perfectly fine, Yoon Seah, teary-eyed, sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  She must have been terribly concerned.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…I’ll find a way to rescind that contract later.’
 </p>
 <p>
  For now, dealing with Dongbang Sak was paramount.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking so, Seong Jihan gestured to her to leave quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s dangerous here. Go home.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Alright, let’s obey the Administrator and return home!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “U-Uncle…! Wait…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as Seong Jihan spoke, the Messenger took Yoon Seah and returned through the portal.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the unexpected guest returned to her original place,
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak, who had observed this with astonished eyes, finally spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Astonishing. How did you survive in that state?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan smiled at the question but didn’t reply directly,
 </p>
 <p>
  Although he didn’t speak, the reason soon became evident.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash…!
 </p>
 <p>
  A golden wheel appeared behind him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Golden Wheel…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Wide-eyed with disbelief, Dongbang Sak stared at it.
 </p>
 <p>
  As it slowly turned once,
 </p>
 <p>
  The wheel turned to dust and vanished.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Golden Wheel…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Witnessing this, the Martial God’s rage flared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ashoka. Even in death, you seek to hinder me again…!]

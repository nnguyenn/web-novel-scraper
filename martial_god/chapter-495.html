  Chapter 495
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He loses his composure whenever Ashoka is mentioned.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s eyes sparkled as he observed the Martial God’s reaction.
 </p>
 <p>
  Suffering great defeat at Ashoka’s hands must have left a lasting impact.
 </p>
 <p>
  Every time Ashoka came up, the Martial God would react violently.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ve healed my broken body using the Golden Wheel. But the authority I used hasn’t been restored.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The fierce battle with Dongbang Sak had pushed him to his limits.
 </p>
 <p>
  The administrative authority he received from the Green Administrator was now mostly exhausted.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, the stat Blue itself had significantly developed compared to when he first encountered Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But at this level, I still can’t defeat him.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who had been thoroughly battered by Dongbang Sak, assessed the situation coldly.
 </p>
 <p>
  His opponent was the strongest Martial Artist, even called the Administrator of Martial Arts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Against him, a simple fighting spirit alone wouldn’t secure victory in this battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Golden Wheel has only two uses left.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Most of the administrative authority was consumed.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the power to rewind his body by 24 hours to a specific point in time using the Golden Wheel,
 </p>
 <p>
  He could only use it two more times.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although his outer appearance was restored, internally, he had almost exhausted everything he had.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The distortion in Martial Soul. I should raise the threshold from 40 to around 45, but then…’
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan calculated the remaining administrative authority,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ashoka… If his legacy still holds influence, could it be… that you can use infinite regression as well…?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God’s head, still materialized, muttered in a serious tone.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Come to think of it, it’s strange. How did you grow so strong compared to the beginning…?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I wonder?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan shrugged his shoulders.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The two eyes of the snake shone brightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  [So far, I could never understand your choices.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Even when I offered you a generous proposal, you rejected it as if seeking a fight. I thought you had a hidden plan, but seeing your battle with Dongbang Sak, it became clear. You were easily overpowered multiple times…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, he did have a plan on his end, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak was just a monstrous freak.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan felt like revealing the truth briefly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Wait. It seems there’s a misunderstanding. I might as well play along.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He decided to leverage this misunderstanding.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…So, what’s your point?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You wanted this situation from the beginning. To enhance your power.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You think I wanted this? Dongbang Sak attacking and smashing my face?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. As a result, you’ve grown immensely stronger than before. You chose battle to enhance your power, trusting Ashoka’s capability…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  He first invaded and then claimed that rejecting his offer to pay 10,000 GP for each victim was part of his design to orchestrate this conflict.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was bewildered by his reasoning.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Right?
 </p>
 <p>
  -I wondered why he fought Dongbang Sak, but it was to enhance his power.
 </p>
 <p>
  -His power has indeed grown tremendously.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why would an Administrator care so much about subordinate species’ life and death…?
 </p>
 <p>
  -So his real intention was growth, rejecting a good proposal on purpose.
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers from other galaxies seemed to agree with the Martial God’s inference.
 </p>
 <p>
  For beings like Administrators, fighting Dongbang Sak to protect humanity seemed beyond their comprehension.
 </p>
 <p>
  From their perspective, the Martial God’s reasoning was more logical.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Indeed, every time Dongbang Sak used Blue, you grew stronger… Blue Administrator. From the outset, this was your plan?]
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s no way he would have fought Dongbang Sak to protect humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  With that premise assumed, the conclusion about Seong Jihan’s intention seemed fitting.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan contemplated.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That misunderstanding isn’t bad.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Golden Wheel could only be used two more times.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak’s powers, bound by the administrative authority, were running low.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this situation, the Martial God’s misconception was favorable to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can’t keep dragging this out. He’ll insist Dongbang Sak use the Taiji Sword if this misunderstanding continues.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite appearing fully recovered, Seong Jihan’s workload left little room for prolonged battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  He hoped the Martial God would cling to this misunderstanding.
 </p>
 <p>
  That way, the Martial God might order Dongbang Sak to draw the Taiji Sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  What a smart opponent wouldn’t fall for easily.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You were hypothesizing…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan had to take a dismissive stance toward the Martial God’s reasoning.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you just making baseless speculations as an observer who didn’t participate?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The Taiji rose behind Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Dongbang Sak, let’s continue our battle.”
 </p>

 <p>
  He drew out his black sword again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anyone could see he was diverting the topic, eager to resume the fight quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite his recent defeats, he was overflowing with fighting spirit.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Indeed, it is peculiar.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak stroked his beard, staring intently at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master, may I raise the power limitation higher? Now that his body has stabilized, I need more strength.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He asked the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Can you become stronger without using Blue?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I’ll try.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Effort is inconsequential. Is it possible or not? That’s all that matters.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The snake gleamed its eyes from Dongbang Sak’s head.
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you amplify Blue and grow stronger, it only benefits the Blue Administrator…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Resolve this within your current power.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if Dongbang Sak amplified his power further, it would only enhance Seong Jihan’s strength thanks to Blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God’s decision carried logical reasoning.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s a pity Blue’s amplification is limited… but thank goodness.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan felt a bit relieved.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then… let’s begin again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak began to summon the sword of light again.
 </p>
 <p>
  The suffocating pressure resumed, enveloping the surroundings.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if Dongbang Sak’s distortion was capped at 40,
 </p>
 <p>
  His transcendental strength remained unchanged.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The light sword technique has progressed.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Initially, he couldn’t combine them, wielding a beam of light instead.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, he compressed 10 light swords,
 </p>
 <p>
  And sent the rest to surround the area.
 </p>
 <p>
  The light swords seemed to encircle Seong Jihan, before plunging into the sea.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…What is this?’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan stared at the swords plunging into the sea, perplexed,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll do my best within the limits of my power.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak raised his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Bubbling,
 </p>
 <p>
  The seawater began to boil, creating bubbles.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shooow!
 </p>
 <p>
  Water erupted and surged forth.
 </p>
 <p>
  -What is this…?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is that… a sword?
 </p>
 <p>
  -How many are there?
 </p>
 <p>
  -The whole area is surrounded…
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan found himself entirely encircled by water-formed swords.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Hundredfold Storm Sword
 </p>
 <p>
  The name of the martial art surged to Seong Jihan’s mind instinctively.
 </p>
 <p>
  The name of a martial art never registered in his Fundamental Divine Arts,
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly it appeared out of the blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is this a martial art I naturally learned through Martial Soul?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak, whose powers were always copied by the Martial God through Martial Soul,
 </p>
 <p>
  Was Hundredfold Storm Sword another one of those?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But why this technique now?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan couldn’t comprehend it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of the martial arts Dongbang Sak displayed during their battle,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Hundredfold Storm Sword was the most flamboyant but the least practical.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That incomprehensible light sword or the blue-white sword pressing through the light was more threatening.’
 </p>
 <p>
  When a technique was copied through Martial Soul,
 </p>
 <p>
  It signified that the technique is within comprehension.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan too could mimic the Hundredfold Storm Sword immediately through the power of Martial Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead of focusing his strength, spreading it out this way,
 </p>
 <p>
  Might be grand in scale but not efficient.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hundredfold Storm Sword… A new martial art within such a short time. See, isn’t this sufficient power?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The snake on Dongbang Sak’s head watched, seemingly satisfied.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He should be stripped of the Martial God title.’
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  This technique might be effective against a group.
 </p>
 <p>
  But it wasn’t efficient for focusing power on an individual.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet the Martial God believed this technique would be enough to overpower his opponent.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even after watching the battle from Dongbang Sak’s perspective, was his judgment that limited?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Of course, it would be problematic if a blue-white sword formed within this Hundredfold Storm Sword…’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was always a risk to anticipate.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s focus shifted to the sword held by Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The sword with only 10 light swords combined. It’s the weakest I’ve seen.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak discarded thirty light swords into the sea for the Hundredfold Storm Sword,
 </p>
 <p>
  Leaving the current sword in Dongbang Sak’s hand notably weaker.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I must sever that sword.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If he couldn’t sever it despite its weakened state,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God wouldn’t order Dongbang Sak to draw the Taiji Sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  He must sever that sword and decisively press the threat.
 </p>
 <p>
  Therefore,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There’s no alternative…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Pook!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan drove his Taiji Sword into his left face.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Huh?
 </p>
 <p>
  -He stabbed himself in the face…?
 </p>
 <p>
  -His face just healed, why stab it again…!!
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as when it shattered before, the void engulfed Seong Jihan’s face quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak furrowed his brows seeing this.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ruining your newly healed face yourself…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s easily restored anyway.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the Golden Wheel having only two uses left,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, conscious of the Martial God, feigned nonchalance as if he could restore it anytime.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swooosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  His left eye and cheek were engulfed by the void.
 </p>
 <p>
  It quickly spread to his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just before the void covered his mouth, the corner of his lips curled up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whooooosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The void surging from his face connected to his Taiji Sword,
 </p>
 <p>
  Amplifying its power intensely like before.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hasn’t the sword become stronger?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Indeed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But the Hundredfold Storm Sword… It’s a feeble attempt.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan looked around, lifting his sword,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dongbang Sak… What are you doing!? Attack now!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Swooooosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  In response to the snake’s command, the Hundredfold Storm Swords launched simultaneously.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I will sever them all in one go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a single movement of his sword,
 </p>
 <p>
  The entirety ahead of him was severed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thousands of Hundredfold Storm Swords,
 </p>
 <p>
  The light sword in Dongbang Sak’s hand,
 </p>
 <p>
  And even his arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  “….”
 </p>
 <p>
  Splash!
 </p>
 <p>
  His severed right arm fell into the sea, Dongbang Sak turned to glance at it.
 </p>
 <p>
  To think his arm was severed by a sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So this is what being cut feels like.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He was always the one cutting others.
 </p>
 <p>
  This feeling is quite unfamiliar.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak raised his right hand to stroke his beard.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Ah, I forgot, my right hand was severed.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He used his left hand to touch his chin.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  In the distance, Seong Jihan was preparing to swing his sword again.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘In this state, I have no means to counter…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The diluted Hundredfold Storm Sword,
 </p>
 <p>
  And his severed arm did not regenerate quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  In his current state, it seemed difficult to withstand the next attack.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, having grown stronger through continuous battle, even shattered his own face to amplify void,
 </p>
 <p>
  Was now completely overpowering him.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  There remained one thing that could reverse this situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  […It can’t be helped.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God was well aware of it.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Draw the Taiji Sword, Dongbang Sak.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the command fell,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoooosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  As though waiting for this moment, Taiji emerged behind Dongbang Sak.

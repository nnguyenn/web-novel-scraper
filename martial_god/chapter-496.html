  Chapter 496
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Dongbang Sak’s arm being severed.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God could not believe the result of the battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  He knew better than anyone the strength of Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even against Seong Jihan, who had become the Blue Administrator, Dongbang Sak had maintained his superior position without fail.
 </p>
 <p>
  And yet, here he was, his arm completely severed by Seong Jihan, who had newly restored himself using the Golden Wheel.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Storm Sword… it was a remarkable technique.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Storm Sword, newly added to the Fundamental Divine Arts,
 </p>
 <p>
  To the Martial God, it seemed like an exceptionally formidable skill.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially since it worked well in conjunction with his constellation relics, enough to believe Dongbang Sak had demonstrated his full potential this time.
 </p>
 <p>
  He hadn’t expected that the dispersed power from that sword would cause the Light Sword to be completely severed by Seong Jihan’s Taiji Sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Blue Administrator. He has indeed grown incomparably stronger than he was initially.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Every time Dongbang Sak amplified his energy, Seong Jihan grew stronger in proportion.
 </p>
 <p>
  To the point where he could eventually overwhelm with sheer force.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, there were ultimately only two methods left.
 </p>
 <p>
  Either lift the pre-established limitations on Dongbang Sak’s strength,
 </p>
 <p>
  Or command him to draw the Taiji Sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But if I lift the strength limitations… It will just result in that fellow growing stronger as well.’
 </p>
 <p>
  So far, Seong Jihan had grown stronger every time Dongbang Sak amplified his energy.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the strength limitations were lifted,
 </p>
 <p>
  It would only accelerate his rate of growth.
 </p>
 <p>
  He did not know how many more times he could use the Golden Wheel,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing him destroy his face without hesitation to cut down Dongbang Sak suggested the uses weren’t severely limited.
 </p>
 <p>
  He wouldn’t resort to such self-destructive acts if he had just one or two uses left.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God continued pondering within his ‘common sense.’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Moreover, if Dongbang Sak undergoes further training… he might slip beyond my control.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Honestly,
 </p>
 <p>
  Even now, it felt somewhat unsettling.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though Dongbang Sak hadn’t outright shown rebellion,
 </p>
 <p>
  After grasping the concept of Blue, his actions felt peculiarly disconcerting.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hence, once he obtained the World Tree, he intended to command him to commit suicide immediately.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Yes. Lifting the strength limitations would only benefit the enemy. The preferable route here is to use the Taiji Sword.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Taiji Sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if his opponent possessed the Golden Wheel, that sword could end it all.
 </p>
 <p>
  That sword possessed a power on a completely different dimension compared to the one Seong Jihan carried around.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the reason he hadn’t allowed Dongbang Sak to draw the Taiji Sword thus far,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Whenever he wielded that sword, Dongbang Sak always looked at the stars.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In the midst of infinite regression,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God had witnessed Dongbang Sak’s memories countless times.
 </p>
 <p>
  And every time Dongbang Sak trained with the Taiji Sword,
 </p>
 <p>
  He would always look at the sky and the stars before drawing the sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  And in the skies and stars of Tuseong,
 </p>
 <p>
  There stood the constellation relics.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Even so, at this point, there is no other choice but to use the Taiji Sword.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The act of looking at the sky whenever he trained the Taiji Sword was probably just a habit.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lifting the strength limitations would only provide more power to the Blue Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ending it here with the Taiji Sword seems the better choice.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having reached this conclusion, the Martial God commanded Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Use the Taiji Sword, Dongbang Sak.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At his command,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  As if waiting for it, Taiji appeared behind Dongbang Sak immediately.
 </p>
 <p>
  Taiji, reversing its course.
 </p>
 <p>
  The world folded as if paper being crumpled.
 </p>
 <p>
  All creation was drawn into its reverse flow.
 </p>
 <p>
  – What is this now, seriously. Right when we thought he won, he pulled out that thing?
 </p>
 <p>
  – So, Seong Jihan uses Taiji, and now this old guy too?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Actually, it seems like he’s the original…
 </p>
 <p>
  – The world folding like that defies supernatural logic, it looks stronger than Seong Jihan’s reverse Taiji…
 </p>
 <p>
  – This might be more powerful…
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan severed Dongbang Sak’s arm, there were cheers of assumed victory in the chat.
 </p>
 <p>
  But as Dongbang Sak invoked Taiji, the atmosphere shifted abruptly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite Taiji merely reversing its flow,
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Everything, except Seong Jihan, was being drawn into it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even the severed arm of Dongbang Sak, which had fallen into the sea,
 </p>
 <p>
  Got sucked into the reversing Taiji.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The clash between my sword and yours… interesting. This is perfect.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak stroked his beard with his left hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  He slowly directed his hand into the center of Taiji.
 </p>
 <p>
  Observing this, Seong Jihan wondered,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Why speak like that? Did he regain his memories?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Although he had less than half a brow left, it furrowed deeply.
 </p>
 <p>
  Didn’t Ashoka suggest drawing the Taiji Sword?
 </p>
 <p>
  Could it be that he has to confront Dongbang Sak wielding the Taiji Sword in a head-on battle?
 </p>
 <p>
  Feigning apparent ease to instill caution in the Martial God, Seong Jihan had little remaining resources.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Administrator Authority is at 5000. After destroying my face with the Golden Wheel, effectively only one use remains.’
 </p>
 <p>
  One more misstep would indeed mean death.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan scrutinized Dongbang Sak’s face more attentively than ever.
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon Dongbang Sak gripping the sword from within Taiji,
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Ah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A slight smile formed on the old man’s lips.
 </p>
 <p>
  “An unexpected outcome.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What do you mean?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That I would draw the sword with my left hand.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak then drew a pure white sword from Taiji.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he compared his sword with Seong Jihan’s, he said with a hint of regret,
 </p>
 <p>
  “The curiosity remains unsolved. Though had they clashed, I would have won.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […Dongbang Sak? What did you just say?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as the snake’s head reemerged,
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re being noisy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack!
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak, with the sword in his hand,
 </p>
 <p>
  Tore off the snake’s form without hesitation.
 </p>

  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  – ??
 </p>
 <p>
  – Why is he doing that suddenly…
 </p>
 <p>
  – He treated that snake with such reverence moments ago;
 </p>
 <p>
  – The Taiji Sword was drawn and his attitude flipped.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Whatever the case, isn’t this good for us??
 </p>
 <p>
  – We should wait and see for sure…
 </p>
 <p>
  People were puzzled by Dongbang Sak’s abrupt action.
 </p>
 <p>
  Naturally, such suspicion would arise considering his 180-degree attitude shift from before.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Finally… it’s happening.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing Dongbang Sak softly gazing at him, Seong Jihan realized Ashoka’s words were true.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Have you… come to your senses?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Indeed. It must have been quite a struggle.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In response to Seong Jihan’s question, Dongbang Sak smiled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yet, you also had much to gain from me, didn’t you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, there were some, but I wouldn’t want to go through such a battle again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why is that? I found it entertaining.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Of course, you enjoyed it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Though feeling dominated strength-wise, but constantly losing in terms of martial skill,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ah.
 </p>
 <p>
  Didn’t he keep realizing that compared to him, he truly lacked talent?
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I don’t wish for such desperate struggles again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “My apologies. But let’s….”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Dongbang Sak spoke midway,
 </p>
 <p>
  Black blood began to trickle from his lips.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Sir?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  Once again, the snake’s face reemerged.
 </p>
 <p>
  It rose from Dongbang Sak’s head and glared at him.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dongbang Sak, you betray me?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Betrayal… I’ve merely regained my senses.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Though I intended to command your suicide before such a day came… perhaps it’s for the best. It would have been harder to deal with rebellion on Tuseong. Die quietly here.]

 <p>
  Upon finishing these words, the snake’s form started to faint and disappear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Cough…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak spat a handful of blood from his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Martial God acts swiftly. He directly invoked the seal.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I see. True to his nature.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as with Ashoka, it’s the same with Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite possessing extraordinary martial prowess, he still couldn’t avoid it.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God certainly prepared meticulously in such matters.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s no time to speak leisurely. Let’s go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  His face having turned pale rapidly, Dongbang Sak jumped into the sea.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whooosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak swiftly descended into the underwater sealed zone.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan followed him, setting foot on the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the sealed zone should have been filled with seawater,
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as Dongbang Sak stepped in,
 </p>
 <p>
  The water in that area drained completely.
 </p>
 <p>
  Only this place in the West Sea remained isolated from the ocean.
 </p>
 <p>
  “After Siddhartha’s sacrifice, the Martial God strengthened the seal imposed on me at least tenfold.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Drip. Drip.
 </p>
 <p>
  With each step he took,
 </p>
 <p>
  Black blood flowed from Dongbang Sak’s entire body.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each drop that landed on the seabed immediately dissolved it, creating deep fissures.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I wished to personally destroy Tuseong with this sword… but my allowed lifespan is nearing its end.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Though physically weakening visibly, Dongbang Sak walked resolutely with the Taiji Sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon, he arrived at the sealing formation etched with the Nine Palace Eight Trigrams Formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak, briefly looking at it,
 </p>
 <p>
  Thunk!
 </p>
 <p>
  He plunged the Taiji Sword into it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash…!
 </p>
 <p>
  A pure white light erupted,
 </p>
 <p>
  Piercing from the seabed to the sky above.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Take my sword and use it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Taiji Sword… you mean?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. I’ve left it embedded here, so it should hold for a while.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Taiji Sword, thrust into the Nine Palace Eight Trigrams Formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite having left Dongbang Sak’s hand, the sword retained its brilliance.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he watched, Dongbang Sak stroked his beard.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now stained with spilled blood, his previously white beard had lost its luster.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gently touching it, he turned to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “And, my technique… how much did you inherit?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Technique… you mean Martial Soul?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Indeed. It hasn’t exceeded 1000, has it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It hasn’t.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s fortunate.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak smiled at this response.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Snake, you have used my martial art all this time. It’s time to pay the price…”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Dongbang Sak sat on the seabed,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  White mist began to rise from his body.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Martial Soul will transform.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as he said this,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The stat ‘Martial Soul’ is changing to ‘Devil’s Intrusion’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A message appeared before Seong Jihan, indicating the transformation of Martial Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Devil’s Intrusion, really.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Wasn’t this what happened when internal energy training went wrong?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan checked his physical condition.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though losing a great deal of strength as Martial Soul transformed,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Since much of it has merged with Blue… Blue is compensating for many parts.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t to the extent that he couldn’t manifest the former Martial Soul abilities.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Not significantly affecting me, but… it might be different for the Martial God.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike himself, whose Martial Soul stat didn’t exceed 1000,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God’s stat would have surpassed that criterion.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan pondered,
 </p>
 <p>
  [What… is this…?]
 </p>
 <p>
  In Tuseong, the side effects of Devil’s Intrusion were becoming palpable.

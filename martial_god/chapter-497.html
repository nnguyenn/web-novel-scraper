  Chapter 497
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God’s star, Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  Quiet to the point where only the Martial God remained,
 </p>
 <p>
  It began to shake wildly after Dongbang Sak transformed the Martial Soul into Devil’s Intrusion.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom! Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  Some of the constellation relics floating in the sky burst explosively.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hisssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  Some began to lose their light and started falling to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The power… it’s uncontrollable…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Martial Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  A power selected as the “Main Ability” for the species ‘humankind’ due to its exceptional traits.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, it wasn’t enough to fully contain Dongbang Sak’s talent.
 </p>
 <p>
  A long time ago, during the early stages of infinite regression,
 </p>
 <p>
  He tried to absorb Dongbang Sak’s martial talents through Martial Soul, only to unmistakably confirm the gap in their abilities.
 </p>
 <p>
  At one point, he tried to match it,
 </p>
 <p>
  But as time passed, he realized the sheer difference in dimensions between their abilities, contenting himself with just plundering Dongbang Sak’s martial skills through Martial Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  […It shouldn’t have been this way…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God, from the sky, looked at the constellation relics moving as they pleased and felt powerless.
 </p>
 <p>
  About 30% of the constellation relics he had raised.
 </p>
 <p>
  But as time went on, the number of relics escaping his control continued to increase.
 </p>
 <p>
  Relics moving and bursting on their own.
 </p>
 <p>
  Why these things would react so violently to Devil’s Intrusion wasn’t something he understood, as he only utilized the Martial Soul but never sought to comprehend it.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God could only helplessly watch the constellation relics fall and explode.
 </p>
 <p>
  When over half of the relics were beyond his control,
 </p>
 <p>
  […Now, I can control it.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The remaining constellation relics began to slowly come under the Martial God’s control.
 </p>
 <p>
  His Martial Soul,
 </p>
 <p>
  No, when his Devil’s Intrusion dropped to 999, he was able to move freely again.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So 1000 is the threshold for Devil’s Intrusion to manifest…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God judged the current situation and quickly moved the constellation relics.
 </p>
 <p>
  Attempting to absorb their power,
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as his Devil’s Intrusion broke past 1000 again,
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom! Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  The constellation relics began to explode autonomously once more.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Argh…! Dongbang Sak…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Absorbing power from the constellation relics only for it to turn into a boomerang.
 </p>
 <p>
  What kind of absurdity was this?
 </p>
 <p>
  At this rate, how could he utilize the constellation relics he had amassed thus far?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ve spent so long accumulating this power…!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the practically useless constellation relics, the Martial God fell into despair.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  From the moment he drew the Taiji Sword, he had a bad feeling,
 </p>
 <p>
  But he believed that as long as he was in Tuseong, he wouldn’t be harmed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since Dongbang Sak was heavily restricted after Ashoka’s betrayal,
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if he regained his senses, he thought he could just kill him and be done with it.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  Transforming Martial Soul into Devil’s Intrusion to bind me like this…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘In contrast, the Blue Administrator has undoubtedly grown stronger…’
 </p>
 <p>
  In the recent battle, despite countless defeats,
 </p>
 <p>
  His power grew even more.
 </p>
 <p>
  A situation diametrically opposed to his, constrained by the constellation relics.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, the strike that severed Dongbang Sak’s arm,
 </p>
 <p>
  It would have been challenging to deal with even with the constellation relics.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if used, it wasn’t easy.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the amplification of power through the relics was blocked…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I won’t be able to seize the Red World Tree, much less—I’ll die at his hands…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Without the strength from the constellation relics, could he truly defeat Seong Jihan with his current power alone?
 </p>
 <p>
  Even amidst his fury, the Martial God coolly assessed this and reached a quick conclusion.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I cannot win.]
 </p>
 <p>
  An ability that even restricted Dongbang Sak,
 </p>
 <p>
  He could also use Ashoka’s Golden Wheel.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing Seong Jihan scrape every possible resource to fight, the Martial God assumed,
 </p>
 <p>
  The loss was recognized from the start.
 </p>
 <p>
  So now, what needed to be done was…
 </p>
 <p>
  […Escape.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Flight and hiding.
 </p>
 <p>
  The solution conceived was inconsistent with the typical image of a “Martial God.”
 </p>
 <p>
  However, from the perspective of the snake, prioritizing survival,
 </p>
 <p>
  This was the most rational approach.

 <p>
  If only, dropping Tuseong and fleeing alone felt wasteful knowing what had been accumulated over time.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Moving Tuseong alongside…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Without amplifying strength through the constellation relics, there was no quick way to move this star.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Martial God contemplated his next move,
 </p>
 <p>
  Vrrrr…
 </p>
 <p>
  A pattern began to manifest in the sky where the constellation relics were plummeting.
 </p>
 <p>
  It resembled Dongbang Sak’s Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dongbang Sak… what on earth are you trying now…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  As he watched, raising his power in tension,
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack!
 </p>
 <p>
  The pattern of the Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods shattered,
 </p>
 <p>
  Thunk…
 </p>
 <p>
  Within it, a red eye fell.
 </p>
 <p>
  [That I should be unfettered like this…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Roll…
 </p>
 <p>
  The red eye rolled on the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  [It seems you’re facing some trouble.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Shine!
 </p>
 <p>
  It radiated an intense light.
 </p>
 <p>
  The red light spread in all directions, revealing a BattleTube screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  The video played at high speed, and then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Indeed…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Beep!
 </p>
 <p>
  It turned off in less than a minute.
 </p>
 <p>
  [See, I told you this would happen. Suffering by your own sword.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Red Administrator…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Are you more inclined to cooperate now?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God silently stared at the red eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  The most dangerous adversary to cooperate with.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Bound by Devil’s Intrusion, I have no other means.’
 </p>
 <p>
  No, there was one way.
 </p>
 <p>
  Abandoning everything.
 </p>
 <p>
  Destroying all the constellation relics and escaping with only the current power,
 </p>
 <p>
  While avoiding the Blue Administrator’s sight, fleeing far away.
 </p>
 <p>
  But living like that,
 </p>
 <p>
  It was not truly living.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Let’s hear what you have to say.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Huhu… you’ll like it.]
 </p>
 <p>
  In the end, the Martial God chose to deal with a dangerous adversary.

  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  After the Martial Soul transformed into Devil’s Intrusion,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now, it’s time to go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak spoke in a relieved voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Are you leaving?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Thanks for everything. I’ve been freed from the Martial God’s enslavement and even got my revenge.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoooosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak’s body slowly began to fade.
 </p>
 <p>
  He briefly glanced at the Taiji Sword embedded in the Nine Palace Eight Trigrams Formation,
 </p>
 <p>
  Gently stroking his beard.
 </p>
 <p>
  “However, I feel sorry for having taken away so many of your training opportunities.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s nothing. Please do more if you can.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can’t do that. The union of Blue and Martial Soul. You should relish that glorious moment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even though Martial Soul has dissipated, can the union still occur?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak looked at Seong Jihan in response to his words.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Actually, the union is nearly complete. You just need to realize it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. So realize it quickly, and thoroughly deal with the snake. Although I’ve restrained much of his power, given time, who knows when he might recover?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even as his body disappeared,
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak calmly discussed the upcoming tasks.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But to deal with the snake, we must know Tuseong’s location.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ll know as soon as you grasp the sword.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You mean the Taiji Sword?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Nod.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak’s nod gave Seong Jihan a reassuring feeling.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ashoka was thorough too.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak was dependable even in these circumstances.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He was terrifying as an enemy, yet reassuring as an ally.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Now it felt more regretful that he was about to disappear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hissss…
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  As Dongbang Sak’s lower body completely vanished,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan realized it was truly the end.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you for everything.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a bowed head, Seong Jihan said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Gratitude… It’s what I should say to you. Take care of what’s next…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak glanced at the Taiji Sword once more and smiled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “And if you have time, clash your Taiji Sword with that one.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Didn’t you assure it would surpass mine?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Still, nearing the end, I’m more curious about that than the snake’s fate.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then I might do it if I have time. If I have time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You promised.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoooosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  With those words,
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak’s form entirely vanished.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The pushed-back seawater began to return underwater.
 </p>
 <p>
  Blue waves flooded the previously isolated space.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet the Taiji Sword embedded in the Nine Palace Eight Trigrams Formation stood firm,
 </p>
 <p>
  Its radiant light piercing the sea and ascending to the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘To clash the two Taiji Swords… how fitting of him till the end.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With a slight smile,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, let’s try drawing it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to grasp the Taiji Sword embedded in the Nine Palace Eight Trigrams Formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  The moment Seong Jihan grasped the sword underwater,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…It’s heavy.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He instantly realized he couldn’t draw it at this moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak mentioned the union of Blue and Martial Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  Only after achieving that could the Taiji Sword be extracted from the Nine Palace Eight Trigrams Formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It feels almost within reach.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks to Dongbang Sak undertaking much of the training,
 </p>
 <p>
  The union of Blue and Martial Soul was near completion.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
 </p>
 <p>
  A single step further,
 </p>
 <p>
  And Martial Soul would be absorbed into Blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan mused on this,
 </p>
 <p>
  A system message appeared before his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have acquired information on the final inscription of the Annihilation God’s Secret.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The final…?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Final?
 </p>
 <p>
  There were five inscriptions in the Annihilation God’s Secret in total, corresponding to five disciples of the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was puzzled.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You recognize the name Galactic Sword Scar.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Galactic Sword Scar can only be used through the Taiji Sword.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Galactic Sword Scar.
 </p>
 <p>
  To leave the scar of a sword on the galaxy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the audacious name of the technique, Seong Jihan chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘More fitting to the Annihilation God’s Secret compared to other techniques.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Only a blade leaving a scar on the galaxy could kill a god.
 </p>
 <p>
  Another reason to unite Blue and Martial Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  Feeling a surge of determination,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Anomalous movement detected…]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly an Administrator window opened.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The stat ‘Devil’s Intrusion’ has its limit modified.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The stat activates at a value of 1100.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The message indicated Devil’s Intrusion’s limit had increased.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is rising now?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Devil’s Intrusion born from the transformation of Martial Soul by Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  It fully activated as a penalty ability at a stat value of 1000.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a substantial restriction meant more for the Martial God who could amplify powers with constellation relics than for Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet this limit suddenly increased by 100?
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Sensing further anomalous movements…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The stat ‘Devil’s Intrusion’ has its limit modified.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The stat activates at a value of 1200.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon after, another increase by 100.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Did the Martial God possess such an easy countermeasure for Dongbang Sak’s restriction?’
 </p>
 <p>
  True, he lacked martial skills compared to Dongbang Sak,
 </p>
 <p>
  But having survived long through infinite regression, he might possess unique methods.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was never an opponent to underestimate.
 </p>
 <p>
  At first, Seong Jihan attributed it to the Martial God’s abilities,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The stat ‘Red’ increases by 1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  But seeing the subsequent message, he narrowed his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Red has increased now?’

  Chapter 498
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought to himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The increase in Devil’s Intrusion’s threshold and the rise in the red’s distortion… These two happening simultaneously is certainly suspicious.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Devil’s Intrusion that Dongbang Sak created by transforming the Martial Soul before he died.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan definitely felt that his power had weakened after the Martial Soul was changed to this.
 </p>
 <p>
  He wasn’t sure how this affected the Martial God, but it couldn’t have been less impactful than on himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, for the threshold to rise from 1000 to 1200, and for the red’s distortion to increase as well…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Did the Martial God make use of the red, or…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recalled when the Red Administrator was killed by Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator, surrounded by the Nine Palaces Eight Trigrams Formation, torn to shreds.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even so, he kept uttering meaningful words until his death.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Hehe… Isn’t it strange?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why hasn’t there been any intervention from the BattleNet even though I revealed myself?
 </p>
 <p>
  -It’s because the ‘Great Sponsor’ is watching over me.
 </p>
 <p>
  As his eyes were pierced by Dongbang Sak,
 </p>
 <p>
  Even as his remains were being sucked into the Nine Palaces Eight Trigrams Formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Kill the Blue one. Only then will today’s events be forgiven…
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator left those words as if he would still be alive.
 </p>
 <p>
  And after Dongbang Sak disappeared, the red’s distortion that hadn’t budged an inch began to move, coincidentally.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was harboring suspicions about this,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The distortion of stat ‘Red’ decreases by 1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, while the Devil’s Intrusion’s activation threshold remained the same, the red’s distortion decreased by 1.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The only being I can think of that can manipulate the red so freely is the Red Administrator.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Raising and lowering the distortion, what excellent control.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan furrowed his brow.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to unite the Blue and Martial Soul quickly and invade Tuseong.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If the Red Administrator was involved, he couldn’t afford to give them much time.
 </p>
 <p>
  He needed to strike quickly and subdue the Martial God while the Devil’s Intrusion was still taking effect.
 </p>
 <p>
  For that…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to draw that out.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Taiji Sword stuck in the sealing formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  To wield that sword, he needed to unite the Blue and Martial Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak had said the unification was almost complete, but Seong Jihan still hadn’t found all the clues.
 </p>
 <p>
  Originally, he had planned to slowly train and complete the sword now that the urgent crisis was over.
 </p>
 <p>
  But seeing the red’s distortion fluctuating, it seemed he didn’t have much time left.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he pondered how to train for this now,
 </p>
 <p>
  Hiss…
 </p>
 <p>
  Void began to rise again from his shattered face.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The side effect of the face I destroyed myself is showing up.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The body he had reversed once with the Golden Wheel.
 </p>
 <p>
  But his face had returned to its original state after he destroyed it himself to fight Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was currently blocking it with the Blue,
 </p>
 <p>
  But the void flowing out from inside could threaten Seong Jihan at any time.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Of course, if I use the Golden Wheel, my face would return to normal, but…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Golden Wheel with 2 chances left.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he used one more here, his face would quickly return to normal.
 </p>
 <p>
  But with the red stat fluctuating like this, and the possibility of the Red Administrator appearing,
 </p>
 <p>
  Using the Golden Wheel here felt a bit wasteful.
 </p>
 <p>
  Wasn’t there a way to heal without using the Golden Wheel?
 </p>
 <p>
  As he pondered for a moment, his eyes fell on,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Taiji Sword and the sealing formation drawn beneath it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Come to think of it, I did recover a bit of the fracture through the World Tree.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red World Tree that had healed Seong Jihan’s void fracture.
 </p>
 <p>
  Last time, he came out quickly after seeing a future where he died to Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now it should be okay to receive treatment.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Taiji Sword being stuck there was a problem, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I think I can enter.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He examined the sealing formation closely and found a gap to enter.
 </p>
 <p>
  It would be better to try healing without using the Golden Wheel if possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But if it doesn’t seem to work inside, I’ll have to get out immediately.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Golden Wheel returns to the state of 24 hours ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he dawdled inside and too much time passed, it would be neither here nor there.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, keeping time in mind, prepared to enter the sealing formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before that,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Everyone, I’ll be ending the broadcast now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to turn off the BattleTube he had kept on for the Star Buff.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ah… He’s not pulling out the sword?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Looks like he’s not rushing into Tuseong right away.
 </p>
 <p>
  -He needs to catch his breath first, the Martial God won’t be an easy opponent either.

 <p>
  -Phew, at least he survived!
 </p>
 <p>
  -I really thought he was going to die this time;
 </p>
 <p>
  -For real, it wasn’t just Seong Jihan who almost died, we were in danger too…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Guess I don’t need to wait at Incheon Airport anymore haha
 </p>
 <p>
  -I’m going to return what I stole from the convenience store.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Now the opposite lane on the highway to the East Sea is jammed, I’ll be living in my car today…
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the broadcast end, viewers who realized the battle was over,
 </p>
 <p>
  They started returning to their daily lives, relieved at Seong Jihan’s victory.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But you know what? You can see the light of that sword from the West Sea lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -No way, that’s impossible. Do you know how far that is??
 </p>
 <p>
  -It’s true, people are taking pictures and going crazy. It stretches all the way to the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  -I saw verification shots saying it’s visible from China too.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow, it’s really true…
 </p>
 <p>
  At the same time, the light in the West Sea became a hot topic.
 </p>
 <p>
  The beam of light emitted by Dongbang Sak’s Taiji Sword, despite originating from the center of the West Sea,
 </p>
 <p>
  Was being observed from the coasts of both Korea and China.
 </p>
 <p>
  As photos related to this were being uploaded to the internet,
 </p>
 <p>
  Step. Step.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, having turned off the broadcast, was taking steps into the sealing formation.
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the sealing formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the place where the Red World Tree should have been, a massive light was piercing through it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That light… It’s the same nature as the light from Dongbang Sak’s Taiji Sword that was seen.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Taiji Sword that had been stuck in the sealing formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Was it affecting even this inside?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan couldn’t help but exclaim in admiration as he saw the beam of light that had consumed more than half of the massive World Tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although he had become considerably stronger compared to before,
 </p>
 <p>
  He still couldn’t analyze what exactly this light from the Taiji Sword was.
 </p>
 <p>
  Maybe he could understand a bit if he pulled out the Taiji Sword and used the Galactic Sword Scar.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was once again recognizing Dongbang Sak as a transcendent of Martial Arts,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ugh… Urgh…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [We, we must escape!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [If we touch that, we’ll be completely annihilated…!]DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  Between the lights of the Taiji Sword,
 </p>
 <p>
  Formless red giants appeared and then were sucked back into the light.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Those are… the red ghosts?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The ghosts of the blood clan that Dongbang Sak had sealed in the World Tree in the past.
 </p>
 <p>
  The red ghosts, who had shown insane regenerative abilities even regenerating their souls, were disappearing, caught in the light of the Taiji Sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Maintaining the power of the Taiji Sword while stuck in the World Tree, and even dealing with the red ghosts… It’s killing two birds with one stone.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan watched the ghosts disappear for a moment, then realized something.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This time, the life force isn’t overflowing like before.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The last time he entered this place, the life force was so abundant it was suffocating.
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, not even half of that remained.
 </p>
 <p>
  The cause of this was probably…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It seems the Taiji Sword is draining the energy.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Taiji Sword that was maintaining its power even after Dongbang Sak disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  So this was the source of its power.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the light that had split the Red World Tree in half, then touched his face.
 </p>
 <p>
  The fracture he had inflicted on himself wasn’t healing as easily as before.
 </p>
 <p>
  The damage was greater than last time,
 </p>
 <p>
  And with the life force in the sealing formation greatly diminished, he had to be content with the wound not widening further rather than healing.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘At this rate, I might have to use the Golden Wheel.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The flow of time was already fast inside the sealing formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he dawdled here with this slow recovery speed, he might miss the chance to use the Golden Wheel.
 </p>
 <p>
  It might be better to just use one coin without being stingy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even as Seong Jihan thought this,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Still, it would be a waste to leave without trying anything.’
 </p>
 <p>
  To save the chance of using the Golden Wheel, he decided to make one attempt.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fundamental Divine Arts,
 </p>
 <p>
  Annihilation God’s Secret
 </p>
 <p>
  Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit.
 </p>
 <p>
  Drrrr…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Red chains extended from Seong Jihan’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  They stretched towards the split World Tree to absorb the life force.
 </p>
 <p>
  But.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as the chains seemed to connect with the tree,
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  They were blocked by something and bounced back.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This… What blocked it?’
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan tried the Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit a few more times, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  The World Tree didn’t allow the chains to touch it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether it was because of the Taiji Sword being stuck there, or for some other reason,
 </p>
 <p>
  In any case, the Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit was currently useless on the Red World Tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  “In that case, I have no choice but to use the Golden Wheel…”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan reluctantly thought about using one of the two remaining coins,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Abnormal movement detected…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The threshold of stat ‘Devil’s Intrusion’ is changing.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Devil’s Intrusion will activate when the stat value reaches 1300.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The distortion of stat ‘Red’ increases by 1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The threshold of Devil’s Intrusion rose again, and the red’s distortion increased along with it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm, seeing this happen again, it really seems to be related to that Red Administrator bastard…’
 </p>
 <p>
  This would be one thing if the opponent was the Martial God with his limbs all cut off.
 </p>
 <p>
  Assuming the Red Administrator was involved, using the Golden Wheel here seemed too wasteful.
 </p>
 <p>
  Wasn’t there any way to extract life force from that World Tree?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought for a moment and recalled something.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Right… Gilgamesh, even with only his skull remaining, he tried to suck it somehow, didn’t he?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even with only his skull left, extending the chains of Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit from the back of his skull,
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh had tried to somehow stick a straw into the sealing formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it’s him, maybe he might have a method?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Fortunately, it’s in my inventory, let’s take it out.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking it was good that he had kept it last time, Seong Jihan took out Gilgamesh’s skull from his inventory.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, Gilgamesh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Tock. Tock.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan tapped the skull with his finger,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Is, is this… outside?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh’s voice was heard from the skull.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [How, how much time has passed… 1, 10 years? 100 years?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, I don’t remember exactly, but at most, it’s been a few months.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Only that much… time has passed?!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Whatever happened inside the inventory,
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh was shocked at Seong Jihan’s words that it had been at most a few months.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. What were you doing in the inventory that you’re so surprised?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That place was a space where I couldn’t do anything… I was just trapped in darkness.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really? Then why are you talking about ten or a hundred years?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [When you’re in there, you lose all sense of how much time has passed. I thought at least 10 years had passed based on how it felt… Huh, to think so little time has actually passed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm, I see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, it seems a lot happened for him in the inventory.
 </p>
 <p>
  But that’s his business.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anyway, moving on. My Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit was bouncing off that thing, do you have any method?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That… yours bounced off?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. I took you out wondering if you had a way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […This energy.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh’s skull, examining the Red World Tree at Seong Jihan’s words,
 </p>
 <p>
  Paused for a moment before answering.
 </p>
 <p>
  […There is a method. However, I’ll only tell you if you promise to revive me.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm, alright. I’ll revive you if you’re useful.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, he could just kill him again after reviving him, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought this, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  [You… You’re planning to kill me again after reviving me, aren’t you?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come on, can’t you trust people?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’re underestimating me too much after what I suffered from the Martial God…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh, having been tricked once by the Martial God, wasn’t going to fall for it so easily.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Swear on your Administrator position. That you won’t kill me again after reviving me!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm, that’s a bit difficult.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [As, as I thought, you’re full of thoughts of killing me…! Then, I won’t cooperate either…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  This guy, he was being annoying.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Fine. I guess I’ll just have to use the Golden Wheel. You can go back into the inventory.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Wh, what…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Wa, wait. Don’t put me back in there…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay. I’ll put you back since you’re useless.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Don’t do that, le, let’s negotiate…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh panicked at Seong Jihan’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Right. First, shouldn’t we see if my method works? At least let me try, try it out!]
 </p>
 <p>
  He went further, shouting to let him test if his method works.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He really hates going into the inventory that much.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He reacted like this just because he said he’d put him back.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan watched Gilgamesh’s skull’s behavior for a moment, then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright. Let’s test it out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He picked up the skull and approached the Red World Tree.

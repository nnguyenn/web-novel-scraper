  Chapter 499
 </p>
 <p>
  [First… bring my head close to the World Tree’s branch.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan approached the red World Tree, Gilgamesh spoke while looking at the widely spread branches.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright. Ah, if you try anything funny, I’ll crush you immediately.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Am, am I crazy? How could I do that when I’m in your grasp…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Stuttering briefly at Seong Jihan’s warning,
 </p>
 <p>
  Hiss…
 </p>
 <p>
  As he approached the branch, he began to create red chains from the back of his skull.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh’s chains, so small they looked like insect legs from afar,
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike Seong Jihan’s Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit, settled comfortably on the branch and,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ziiing…
 </p>
 <p>
  Started absorbing the life force within.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hu, huhu… Why doesn’t this work for you?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The skull, seeing its success, looked at Seong Jihan with a smug smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  And soon, flesh began to form on the skull,
 </p>
 <p>
  Instantly transforming back into Gilgamesh’s original head.
 </p>
 <p>
  The World Tree’s life force was certainly amazing.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was thinking this,
 </p>
 <p>
  “As expected, you haven’t properly mastered my ability…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh, already regenerated to his upper body, was sneering at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Always getting beaten, he was too happy to find one thing he was good at.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Indeed. What’s the difference?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan tilted his head and tried using Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ting!
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike Gilgamesh, his chains were blocked by the World Tree’s branches and bounced off.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hu, huhu. Did you think I’d tell you easily? First, promise you won’t kill me for life. And, hmm… Right. I’ll officially recognize you as my son, so call me father.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aren’t you tired of that father talk?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh, excited after coming back to life a bit, was running his mouth like before.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned at this.
 </p>
 <p>
  As expected, people don’t change easily.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huhu… The void on your face looks like it might devour you any moment. Are you okay leaving it like that? If you just respect and treat me well, I could solve it for you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Hiss…
 </p>
 <p>
  As Gilgamesh continued talking, his entire body had already recovered.
 </p>
 <p>
  To return to his original body in just a few minutes from a half-destroyed skull.
 </p>
 <p>
  The World Tree was truly amazing.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is it a choice between using the Golden Wheel once or calling him father?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing him so proud like that, the former seems better.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought this, then changed his approach.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I admit that my Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit doesn’t match yours.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huhu, then…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But, would this not work on you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish swish swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan extended the chains that had bounced off towards Gilgamesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Eek…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  He tried to dodge Seong Jihan’s Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit somehow, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  He was no match at all for Seong Jihan, who had already defeated Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the chains quickly pierced Gilgamesh’s body,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh, urgh…! Wa, wait! This isn’t right…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why not? I don’t want to call you father?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan tilted his head and absorbed the World Tree’s energy from him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, unlike Gilgamesh who crumbled and returned to his original skull form,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Void decreases by 50.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Eternity increases by 3.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The efficiency of the incomplete stat ‘Eternity’ increases.]
 </p>
 <p>
  For Seong Jihan, along with these system messages,
 </p>
 <p>
  Hiss…
 </p>
 <p>
  The void on his face began to disappear.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Indeed, the life force of this Red World Tree is unique.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Life force that eliminates void.
 </p>
 <p>
  And seeing that it increases the efficiency of Eternity, it’s certainly something special.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow, good performance.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […..]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Gilgamesh. From now on, you’re… right, a transformer.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […A transformer? What’s that?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a device that converts 110V to 220V. Filter the life force for me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You bastard…! Do you think I’ll help you willingly?!]
 </p>

 <p>
  Gilgamesh, enraged after gaining and losing his body,
 </p>
 <p>
  For now, he didn’t seem willing to cooperate.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, the void is somewhat better now, so should I put him in the inventory for now?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought this and opened his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Inventory.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Wh, wait… Why the inventory…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why? I need to put the item away.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That item, you don’t mean me…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Wa, wait. Alright. I won’t make you call me father…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Did he hate the inventory that much?
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just go in for now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He should discipline him by leaving him there once more.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking this, Seong Jihan put Gilgamesh back into the inventory.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Time flows faster here, so I should go home and come back.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With this level of void, he could block it somewhat with Blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  He needed to go out, unite Blue and Martial Soul, then come back to absorb more life force.
 </p>
 <p>
  By then, Gilgamesh should have come to his senses in the inventory.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I don’t know why only his chains work, but…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh’s authority, which didn’t seem much different from his own chains on the surface.
 </p>
 <p>
  In fact, in terms of the power contained, Gilgamesh’s was much weaker compared to Seong Jihan’s.
 </p>
 <p>
  But he didn’t understand why Gilgamesh could absorb life force and he couldn’t.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, if I think about it more, I’ll find an answer.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to ask next time he took him out, and left the sealing formation.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God’s star, Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  There, a red eye connected to seven constellation relics was emitting a dense energy.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hmm… Dongbang Sak. You’ve created something quite tricky. Indeed, this is fitting for an entity outside the norm.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial Soul transformed into Devil’s Intrusion.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator had boasted that he would solve its restrictions for the Martial God, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  Things weren’t going as easily as expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You were so confident about solving it, but there’s no progress at all. Will you keep it stopped at 1300?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Huhu… You have no other way to solve it besides me. Your urging is too harsh. If you want it solved quickly, why don’t you support more constellation relics?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Hearing this, the Martial God’s eyes flashed sharply.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You haven’t even fully utilized the performance of the seven relics, why are you asking for one more?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s because I’m not you. How could someone who isn’t the owner fully draw out the relics’ performance?]
 </p>
 <p>
  […I wonder.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God looked at the red eye, the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  At first,
 </p>
 <p>
  When the red eye popped out as Dongbang Sak’s Nine Palaces Eight Trigrams Formation shattered, it barely had any power,
 </p>
 <p>
  But after the Martial God supported it with the constellation relics, it had rapidly recovered its power.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it was like this with seven, if he supported more…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The owner of this place might change.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even now, in terms of power alone, the Red Administrator was extremely weak.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the Martial God manifested in his main body and just stomped on it, that eyeball would burst helplessly.
 </p>
 <p>
  But,
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s why the Martial God raised his guard even more.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Even with that much, he modified the Devil’s Intrusion.’
 </p>
 <p>
  To the Martial God, the Red Administrator’s power seemed pathetic.
 </p>
 <p>
  But with just that power, he was modifying Dongbang Sak’s Devil’s Intrusion.
 </p>
 <p>
  For the Martial God, who knew well how much of a monster Dongbang Sak was, the Red Administrator who could modify this seemed like a similar monster.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the monster he had put a leash on last time eventually betrayed him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This time, I absolutely won’t let that happen.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Already betrayed twice by Ashoka and Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  Learning from those experiences, he shouldn’t fall for the Red Administrator’s tricks.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking this, the Martial God was more interested in,
 </p>
 <p>
  Firmly suppressing the Red Administrator than lifting the restrictions of Devil’s Intrusion.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the Martial God’s cautious demeanor, the Red Administrator,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Emitted a red light from his eyeball.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tsk, you’re still so wary of me. I told you I just need to kill the Blue Administrator.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You seem quite obsessed with the Blue Administrator.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Blue’s authority is inherently opposite to mine from birth. It’s the biggest threat to the Hell system I built.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Wasn’t the Hell already destroyed?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Creating a system is difficult, but restoring one that’s been made is easy. If we just remove Blue, the Hell will expand smoothly.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator, obsessed with the Hell system he created,
 </p>
 <p>
  Realizing that the administrator ability ‘Blue’ was opposite to this, he was trying to eliminate the Blue Administrator by any means.

 <p>
  [So you should quickly prepare to invade Earth and spread the word about it.]
 </p>
 <p>
  If you’re really going to attack, you should surprise them rather than announce it widely.
 </p>
 <p>
  Openly revealing this is indeed…
 </p>
 <p>
  [Are you trying to lure him here?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. The Blue Administrator will surely come to stop the attack on Tuseong… That’s when we’ll join forces to subdue him.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [By ‘we’, it seems like it’ll mostly be my power being used.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Huhu… I’ll be of help too. Just like I’m solving your Devil’s Intrusion now.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator showed strong enthusiasm to kill the Blue Administrator, his opposite.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the Martial God,
 </p>
 <p>
  […I’ll think about it.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Didn’t show as much will as the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Whenever I got involved with the Blue Administrator, I only ended up at a loss…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Both with Ashoka and Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whenever he tried to subdue Seong Jihan, things always went wrong.
 </p>
 <p>
  This time too, wouldn’t Tuseong just end up being raided if he lured them here unnecessarily?
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Dongbang Sak left that sword.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Taiji Sword stuck in the World Tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  It clearly possessed extraordinary power at a glance.
 </p>
 <p>
  If Seong Jihan came wielding that and attacked Tuseong, this star would just be devastated.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator had his own reasons for needing to eliminate Seong Jihan,
 </p>
 <p>
  But the Martial God thought differently.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Now that Martial Soul is bound by Devil’s Intrusion, I can’t gain power even if I obtain the Red World Tree.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red World Tree, which was the reason he had dispatched Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now that it was useless to him, he wondered if there was any reason to fight the Blue Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, by cooperating with the Red Administrator to overcome Devil’s Intrusion,
 </p>
 <p>
  And regaining his power through this, he could have the strength to contend with the Blue Administrator, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Fighting in my own base only harms me. Rather,’
 </p>
 <p>
  Red and Blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  Couldn’t he pit the two Administrators against each other and stay out of it himself?
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Martial God, who had only suffered losses from conflicts with Seong Jihan, was thinking this,
 </p>
 <p>
  […..]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator was quietly observing the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  His opponent had become passive due to a few failures.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He’s already lost his will… Good.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator was rather pleased with his counterpart’s attitude.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, returning home through the front door window as usual,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… Un, Uncle. You’re back?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing Yoon Seah sitting in the living room startled by his appearance, he twitched his eyebrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why are you so surprised?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah. That’s…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is it because of the Void Apostle?”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s question, Yoon Seah hung her head low.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you’re going to look so guilty, why did you do it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I thought you were being consumed by the void… I wanted to help somehow…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan let out a small sigh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, in truth, he could understand her feelings,
 </p>
 <p>
  But still, it was hasty.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, they say it can’t be canceled?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Yoon Seah couldn’t answer,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The starfish, Messenger, appeared beside her.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Blue Administrator. Yoon Seah is already half-confirmed as the owner of the Arena. This cannot be canceled.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “If it’s half-confirmed, there’s still a possibility, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [No, it’s just a figure of speech… She’ll become the Arena’s owner as soon as the training period ends.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “How is it already decided when she hasn’t done anything? No matter how great her potential…”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was about to say something to the Messenger,
 </p>
 <p>
  Hiss…
 </p>
 <p>
  The void swirling on his face was suddenly sucked into Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was on a completely different level from when Yoon Seah had absorbed it before.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Huh, the effect is good?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Those words came out of Seong Jihan’s mouth involuntarily.
 </p>
 <p>
  [As expected, even the Blue Administrator acknowledges it. Yoon Seah possesses the talent to become the Arena’s owner.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just because she has talent doesn’t mean she has to do it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Things have come to this, why don’t you accept it?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Forget it. Tell them to reverse it. And,”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan said this, then added one more thing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems the Red Administrator has been resurrected in Tuseong. Inform the Black Administrator about that too, Messenger.”

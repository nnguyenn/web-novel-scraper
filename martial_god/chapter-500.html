  Chapter 500
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Red Administrator has been resurrected… Are you certain?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. The red’s distortion increased, and the Martial God’s restrictions are gradually being lifted. Only the Red Administrator could make this possible.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Distortion? I’m not sure what you mean by that…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s something the Administrators know about. Just relay it as is.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Understood. I’ll convey that news immediately.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, by the way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan paused while speaking to the Messenger and observed him closely.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The ‘Great Sponsor’ the Red Administrator mentioned, it’s not related to the Black Administrator, is it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Great Sponsor that the Red Administrator had mentioned when fighting Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  An entity worthy of being called great by someone of that caliber,
 </p>
 <p>
  There were only two such beings in the BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Black Administrator and the White Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Hell that the Red Administrator built is originally a domain that the Black Administrator should strictly oversee. Why would he cooperate with such a madman?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so? But couldn’t he be trying to change from the existing Void to the Hell?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Black Administrator is not that kind of person. Besides, he wouldn’t entrust such an important task to someone like Red.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Messenger strongly denied any connection between the ‘Great Sponsor’ and the Black Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then if not Black, is it White?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That… is something a lowly being like me cannot know.]
 </p>
 <p>
  He was not denying it outright.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan asked, just in case.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Surely there isn’t a third party in the BattleNet, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  […Yes. Only the two permanent Administrators would qualify as sponsors great enough for the Red Administrator to call them that.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then it’s White. According to what you’re saying.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I’m just a mere messenger… I know nothing about this matter!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Messenger only claimed ignorance, without denying it.
 </p>
 <p>
  He couldn’t get anything more out of this guy.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright. I guess there’s nothing more from you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s right, there isn’t!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “But we’ll be able to tell whether the Black Administrator is related to Red or not by his subsequent actions.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [What do you mean by that…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “If there’s no response even after I’ve informed him that the Red Administrator has been resurrected in Tuseong, it would mean Black is also connected to them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ah… That’s impossible. He will take action immediately.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right, let’s see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan said this with a face that didn’t seem very expectant, then pointed his thumb at Yoon Seah behind him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “And when you report, also inform them about the Arena owner issue.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […Understood.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  With those final words, the Messenger disappeared, buried in purple void.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm, I wonder if it’ll work out…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I doubt it. We’ll have to wait and see about the Red issue… As for the Arena owner problem, they seem quite obsessed with you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s words, Yoon Seah pointed to her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They say I have the best compatibility with that hat. Among all the Arena owners in history.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Isn’t that just something nice they’re saying? No matter what, you’re still human.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They said the Great Vessel of the Void, this gift, originally had SSS-grade as its maximum. Apparently, this is the first time an EX has appeared?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the first time an EX grade had appeared, huh.
 </p>
 <p>
  How was that possible given how vast the BattleNet world is?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Seah is an exceptional player, but she’s not exactly the best in the universe… I guess it must be related to humanity’s limits not being set.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking that Seah receiving an EX was probably related to species characteristics, Seong Jihan judged that they wouldn’t easily give up on her.
 </p>
 <p>
  If that was the case,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Should I just destroy that hat?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the black fedora floating above Yoon Seah’s head, which had become more distinct than before.
 </p>
 <p>
  That thing, he might be able to get rid of it with Blue if he did it right.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah, should I just destroy the hat for you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh? That hat is still on me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, it’s become more vivid.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But, but shouldn’t we try to resolve this through dialogue with them first? It’s not that urgent. I’m not particularly uncomfortable either.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Rather, look at this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah placed her hand on Seong Jihan’s face.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The void rising from his face was completely cleared away.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing Seong Jihan’s revealed face,
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">

   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  “Ah…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah let out a gasp.
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to the intact right side of his face, The left side was cracked like broken glass in all directions, and some fragments were missing,
 </p>
 <p>
  With purple void continuously flowing out of the empty spaces.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if she absorbed the void into the Great Vessel of the Void like this, As long as those cracks exist, void would keep flowing out.
 </p>
 <p>
  She looked at Seong Jihan with trembling eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Un, Uncle. Doesn’t it hurt…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not at all. It’s fine.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan touched his face with an expression that suggested it was no big deal.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sense of pain in this area had long been lost anyway.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But, when the void completely disappears, the recovery seems to speed up a bit.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Until then, the regenerative power of Eternity was mainly used to prevent the wound from widening further.
 </p>
 <p>
  After Yoon Seah removed the void, the shattered face was slowly, very slowly, starting to fill in the gaps.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh… Uncle. The wound is healing!”
 </p>
 <p>
  And Yoon Seah, seeing this, her eyes lit up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle’s void, it can be handled like this! Am I not helpful?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, this time you were helpful.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Great! Let’s use this until Uncle’s face gets better, okay?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, it’s fine. Didn’t you see me recover last time?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You mean when that wheel thing came out? You can’t use that freely, can you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, I can use it freely.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah narrowed her eyes at this and looked at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come on, if that were true, knowing Uncle’s personality, you would have used it already. No matter how I look at it, isn’t that an overpowered skill with limited uses? That’s the only way it would be balanced.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you think there’s balance in the BattleNet?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But, but still! Anyway, there must be some restriction, that’s why you didn’t use it…! Let’s just treat it like this until we get an answer!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah insisted on playing the role of a void absorber like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at her with a slightly disgruntled expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, honestly, it is helpful in the current situation, but…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Just doing this once, a little more, she said.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was worried that this might eventually lead to her becoming the Arena owner.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Should I just destroy it?’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan once again looked at the fedora floating above Yoon Seah’s head,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, and…! Uncle, you said you couldn’t enter the Void Training Room, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I got a training room! Want to train here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Training room?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah started to offer yet another convenience.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  The Void Training Room.
 </p>
 <p>
  This place, where time flowed differently from the outside,
 </p>
 <p>
  Was a very useful location for Seong Jihan, who was pressed for time.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘At the end, it was 100 to 1.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In the Void Training Room modified by the previous Arena owner,
 </p>
 <p>
  When 100 days passed in the training room, only one day passed outside.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks to training here consistently every time, he was able to keep up with cosmic-level strong opponents without falling behind.
 </p>
 <p>
  But after the Arena owner disappeared and this place was closed, it was really regrettable.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…The training room, it really works.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan entered the Void Training Room opened by Yoon Seah and blinked his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, they said as a provisional Arena owner, various functions were added. There was also a training room option. Since I’m still provisional, the maximum time flow adjustment is about 5 times, though.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “5 times is not bad at all.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The training room in the penthouse not only had the same time flow,
 </p>
 <p>
  But because Seong Jihan was so strong, it was difficult to properly train his power inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  In contrast, the Void Training Room was a space where he could rampage moderately,
 </p>
 <p>
  For Seong Jihan, who needed to unite Blue and Martial Soul, it was the most suitable place for training.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Arena owner… it’s good, isn’t it?’
 </p>
 <p>
  It eliminates the void. It provided a training room.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it wasn’t for Yoon Seah, he would have just told her to do it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought this and gave a bitter smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  He couldn’t make his niece do something like becoming the Arena owner.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle, but there’s a small problem…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah trailed off while looking at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What problem?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Since it’s my first time inviting someone else, I went out for a bit earlier to see if it still applied outside?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah.”
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  “The training room is maintained even when I’m outside, but if Uncle trains here, I can peek inside.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really? How does it look?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It just appears like a BattleTube screen.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Did the previous Arena owner also peek at the training in the training room then?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He always appeared with perfect timing. So he had such surveillance means.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought this and shrugged his shoulders.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, you can look as much as you want. There’s nothing special to see anyway.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, I won’t look! I was just telling you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright, alright. Then, can I train for a bit?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, then… we’re postponing breaking my hat until we hear from the Void side, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As she said this, Yoon Seah pointed to her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  The black fedora, which seemed to have a stronger presence now that they were in the Void Training Room.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Let’s wait until Blue and Martial Soul are united.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It wouldn’t be right to take action before confirming the Void side’s intention.
 </p>
 <p>
  Besides, it would be better to deal with it after uniting Blue and Martial Soul, to handle it more effectively.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan rationalized like this and nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right. Let me know when you get an answer.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay! Ah, the void is flowing out again… I’ll remove it once more!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah absorbed Seong Jihan’s void one more time and then left the training room.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is full-care service.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Removing void and providing a training room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan marveled once again at the conveniences his niece was providing, then began his earnest training.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Blue and Martial Soul… Dongbang Sak definitely said they were already practically united.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Recalling that time, Seong Jihan was changing the training room map settings to the underwater location where he had talked with Dongbang Sak, when,
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Hmm, it’s definitely healing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, who had told Seong Jihan she wouldn’t look inside the training room,
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as she went outside, she brought up a screen and was closely examining his face.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s face, with the cracks slowly but surely filling in.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing this, she felt a sense of accomplishment.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Lately, people calling Uncle a monster has been really annoying…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Humanity, which had evolved as a species and greatly improved in health thanks to Seong Jihan’s achievements.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wouldn’t be strange to say that all of humanity owed him a debt at this point.
 </p>
 <p>
  But still, there were twisted people everywhere in the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan was normal, there wasn’t much for them to pick on, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘After his face became like that, there have been too many malicious comments.’
 </p>
 <p>
  After Seong Jihan’s cracks widened,
 </p>
 <p>
  While the majority felt sorry for him, a tiny minority of people,
 </p>
 <p>
  -Seong Jihan’s face really became f*cked up lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -At this point, he’s not human anymore.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Isn’t he an Administrator?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Administrator my ass, he’s just a mosaic monster lolol
 </p>
 <p>
  They mocked him, saying he had become a monster.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, their proportion was extremely low, to the point where it shouldn’t even be worth paying attention to, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Trash.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even that made Yoon Seah angry.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, even those who didn’t mock Seong Jihan,
 </p>
 <p>
  There were quite a few people who felt a sense of alienation and fear at his changed appearance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing these reactions, she even felt betrayed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘People who benefited so much from Uncle. How can they react like that just because his face is a bit broken…’
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how different he looks from before,
 </p>
 <p>
  Shouldn’t humanity not act like this?
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, the majority wasn’t like that, but, she didn’t like even those few reactions.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll somehow return him to his original state.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah made this resolution while watching the screen showing the inside of the training room.
 </p>
 <p>
  And a few days later,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Seah, don’t you need to go now? Isn’t your Space League match today?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, Mom…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Locked up in her room, watching Seong Jihan’s training,
 </p>
 <p>
  She briefly took her eyes off the screen when her mother, Seong Jiah, entered the room.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have something more important to do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […More important than the Space League match? You know you’re ranked 1st, right?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, I know. But this is more important.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As she said this, watching Seong Jihan’s face,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing void starting to rise again, she suddenly got up from the bed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll be right back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With those words, Yoon Seah disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jiah looked at the empty bed and sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [What is she trying to do…]

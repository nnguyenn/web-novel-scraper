  Chapter 501
 </p>
 <p>
  On the day of the Space League match.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Today’s match is against ‘Orcs’.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Since we’ve met each team once, we’re facing a previous opponent again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The commentators were explaining about the opposing race ‘Orcs’ with relaxed faces.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This was the team where we only needed to watch out for the Orc Great Chieftain, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “According to what player Seong Jihan revealed before, the Orc Great Chieftain had the characteristic of absorbing the life force and strength of other Orcs.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He would raise his hands to the sky as if receiving the power of ancestors, but was actually absorbing the power of his own race.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The strategy to counter this has already been revealed, and our forces are prepared, so we can expect a victory.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “In the league rankings, humans are in 1st place while Orcs are in 12th!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The commentators were generally optimistic about victory.
 </p>
 <p>
  This sentiment was shared by the viewers watching the league match.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Orcs… This should be an easy one lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -For real, gotta secure that mid-tier and maintain the 1st place ranking.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Maintain 1st place… Have we been chased that closely?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Since Seong Jihan stepped back as an administrator, our daily point intake has drastically decreased… We might get overtaken by the World Tree Elves again at this rate.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yeah, we need to win today to keep the 1st place ranking.
 </p>
 <p>
  Humanity was maintaining the 1st place ranking in the Space League.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, this position wasn’t as secure as it seemed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The World Tree Elves, despite losing to humanity, had a far superior daily point acquisition rate.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were rapidly closing the score gap.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan was around, they had actually widened the gap.
 </p>
 <p>
  But since he became an administrator, the 1st place position had become precarious.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, today’s match against Orcs was a must-win.
 </p>
 <p>
  But then.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh… Yoon Seah isn’t on the player roster?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh no, what’s going on??”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even if the opponent is a mid-tier race, Yoon Seah is an essential force for us…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, we just got word that due to a very important matter, she won’t be participating in this match.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But… what could be more important than the Space League?”
 </p>
 <p>
  At the commentators’ remarks after checking the human team roster,
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers began to stir.
 </p>
 <p>
  -??
 </p>
 <p>
  -What important matter?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Seong Jihan won in the West Sea, so there shouldn’t be any big issues, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Seriously, what could be more important than the Space League
 </p>
 <p>
  -It’s not like 1st place is secure, she should be playing today to keep that 1st place spot. What’s she doing, really?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Well, I guess she might have reasons not to play… Can we win without Yoon Seah?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Come on; it’s not a national team game, it’s the human representative team match. She absolutely has to show up. Are they joking?
 </p>
 <p>
  -For real, and Yoon Seah’s role in the team is no joke these days; she’s like 0.5 Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Hey, 0.5 is an exaggeration. Let’s say 0.3.
 </p>
 <p>
  After Seong Jihan left the human representative team, Yoon Seah filled that void.
 </p>
 <p>
  She had firmly established herself as humanity’s ace by winning consecutive series MVPs in the Space League.
 </p>
 <p>
  But now such a player was dropping out due to an ‘important matter’.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh? Seah’s not playing?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Shadow Queen turned her head towards Seong Jiah while watching TV.
 </p>
 <p>
  [She said she’s busy.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What could she be busy with…? She only plays BattleNet, she’s skipping the most important Space League?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hmm… Seems like she’s taking care of Jihan.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Who’s taking care of whom?”
 </p>
 <p>
  When the Shadow Queen asked incredulously, Seong Jiah silently tapped her own face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can she fix the broken face?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Looks like it. Seah can absorb the void.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… Then I guess that is more important. But couldn’t she absorb it after playing the match?”
 </p>
 <p>
  How long could a Space League match take?
 </p>
 <p>
  To the Shadow Queen’s reasonable question, Seong Jiah sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I know, right? I think she’s become a bit… sensitive since Jihan almost died last time.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “During the fight with Dongbang Sak?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yeah. She became a Void Apostle then.]
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">
  <script>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  The battle between Seong Jihan and Dongbang Sak in the West Sea.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan’s face was shattered by Dongbang Sak and he was being consumed by the void,
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, saying she couldn’t just stand by, became Void Apostle before Seong Jiah could even try to stop her.
 </p>
 <p>
  After Seong Jihan restored himself with the Golden Wheel, she even berated herself for becoming an Apostle unnecessarily, saying she should have listened to her uncle.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…But now, she seems satisfied with being a Void Apostle again.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Her daughter, smiling and saying she could now be of real help to her uncle.
 </p>
 <p>
  After providing Seong Jihan with a training room, she stopped leveling up in BattleNet and locked herself in her room, meticulously checking the void on her face.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I’m all for her helping Jihan, but she should do it while taking care of her own responsibilities… I’m worried she might become obsessed with being a Void Apostle at this rate.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why? She can just keep being an Apostle.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Then she’ll keep being entangled with the void and become the owner of the Arena.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow. Is the Arena owner position reserved for her? I’m so jealous.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Crunch. Crunch.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Shadow Queen expressed her pure envy while munching on snacks.
 </p>
 <p>
  […You think that’s good?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course. The Arena owner is the top of the hierarchy in the void. Even stronger than most Great Constellations. The authority they hold is immense. If Seah’s giving it up, I want to do it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You don’t have the void aptitude.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hah… I thought anyone could become the Arena owner, but it turns out you need a gift. The world is so unfair.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Shadow Queen, who had been envying Yoon Seah,
 </p>
 <p>
  Watched the Space League match progress and narrowed her eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, humanity… looks like they’re going to lose?”
 </p>
 <p>
  […Yeah. This happens right when Seah’s absent.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The human representative team, ranked 1st, with all members present except for Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the flow of the game was turning unfavorable for humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Th-the Orc Great Chieftain. He won’t fall. He’s reviving again!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah. The Sword King clearly killed him, but how is he coming back to life?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just like we saw before, our team subdued the other Orcs first… but this is strange. It’s not working out like last time!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The human representative team tried to subdue the opponent in the same way Seong Jihan had conquered Orcs, but
 </p>
 <p>
  The game wasn’t progressing as easily as they thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  -No way… looks like we might lose?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why is this happening? Why can’t they kill the rear Orcs?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Somehow… the damage seems insufficient
 </p>
 <p>
  -Come on, this is a bit much just because one player is missing;
 </p>
 <p>
  The human representative team, unable to conquer the Orc Great Chieftain, was falling one by one.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, your husband fell too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Could you add ‘ex’ to that?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, sorry. Anyway, if the Sword King is dead too… we’ve lost?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The match between humanity and Orcs, which was expected to be an easy win,
 </p>
 <p>
  Was going far from predictions from the very first game.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, in the void training room.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, I appreciate you removing the void, but…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned as he saw Yoon Seah enter the training room.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t you have anything else to do? Why do you come here so often?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come on~ This is the most important thing. But I’m still doing all my other tasks on time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, who would rush in to absorb it as soon as the void leaked from the cracks on his face.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks to her real-time care, Seong Jihan’s face had recovered significantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  At this rate, he might not even need to use the Golden Wheel for sure.
 </p>
 <p>

  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The big cracks will probably need to be healed at the World Tree again, but the small fissures have been treated a lot.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The presence or absence of void on his face made a clear difference in recovery.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright then, Uncle. I’ll come back if more void leaks out~”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m really fine now. Go do your own work.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But this is my work?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay, okay! I’m going! Going!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish. Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  With those final words, Yoon Seah waved her hand and left the training room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at where she had disappeared with a rather displeased expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Considering the 5x speed difference between here and outside, she really seems to be coming here extremely often…’
 </p>
 <p>
  And the way she appeared with perfect timing whenever void flowed from his face,
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  It almost seemed like real-time surveillance.
 </p>
 <p>
  …Surely.
 </p>
 <p>
  She wasn’t actually doing that, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This won’t do. After I merge Blue and Martial Soul, I need to quickly remove that hat from her.’
 </p>
 <p>
  At this rate, she might even try to become the Arena owner.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan worried about this as he started to seriously elevate Blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It feels like it’s about to work, but not quite.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak, who had been an unparalleled genius in BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan wasn’t lacking in martial talent either, he couldn’t compare to Dongbang Sak who had been like a ‘bug’.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks to his substitute training last time, Blue and Martial Soul had found many points of convergence, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  The final touch to perfect it wasn’t coming easily.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The one good thing is that the red’s distortion level hasn’t been increasing lately.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In the beginning, the red’s distortion level had risen and fallen steeply.
 </p>
 <p>
  But since the limit of Devil’s Intrusion became 1500, this value hadn’t changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it had been skyrocketing, he would have felt more anxious.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was somewhat fortunate that it stopped here.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Did what I told the Messenger to relay have an effect?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Or is the other side also at a standstill?
 </p>
 <p>
  Whatever the reason,
 </p>
 <p>
  It was fortunate that the red’s distortion had stopped.
 </p>
 <p>
  He should push forward quickly now.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought this as he resumed training, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Hah. I don’t know.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The unification of Blue and Martial Soul wasn’t progressing as smoothly as he’d hoped.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now that Dongbang Sak, who had spoon-fed him, was gone, the final step just wasn’t coming together.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan tried various tests and then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Maybe I should take a short break.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He sighed deeply and changed the training room’s environment settings.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since racking his brain alone wasn’t yielding immediate results,
 </p>
 <p>
  He decided to review previous battles while resting.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should watch Dongbang Sak’s movements and review how he handled Blue.’
 </p>
 <p>
  So Seong Jihan played back the battle he had fought with Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  The battle footage he turned on without much expectation, just to rest,
 </p>
 <p>
  Began to unfold within the training room as if he had entered a virtual reality.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, old man. Your movements are still impressive even when I watch it again.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was nodding while watching himself get sliced up,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The characteristic of Heterogeneous Martial Comprehension is activating.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Heterogeneous Martial Comprehension, which only activates when experiencing the powers of different species,
 </p>
 <p>
  Started working here.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Wait. Why is this… when it’s just humans fighting each other.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Heterogeneous Martial Resolve.
 </p>
 <p>
  A characteristic that researches and absorbs the powers of different species to fit one’s own.
 </p>
 <p>
  It had become obsolete as he rose from player to administrator, with no more to absorb from ordinary heterogeneous powers,
 </p>
 <p>
  But unexpectedly, it was activating while watching the battle with Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  At first, Seong Jihan wondered why this was happening, but
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Ah, is it because I’m no longer human as an administrator?’
 </p>
 <p>
  He quickly realized why it had activated.
 </p>
 <p>
  By becoming the Blue Administrator,
 </p>
 <p>
  He had definitely left the human species category.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This… There was definitely a way to amplify its effect even more.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s eyes lit up as he called up the system description for Heterogeneous Martial Comprehension.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Heterogeneous Martial Comprehension]
 </p>
 <p>
  -Researches and absorbs the martial arts and powers of different species to fit your own kind.
 </p>
 <p>
  -As the Void ability value increases, the class correction effect grows larger, and efficiency increases further when training in the space of the hidden world.
 </p>
 <p>
  Heterogeneous Martial Comprehension, which increases efficiency in the hidden world space, the void training room.
 </p>
 <p>
  This also improved in effectiveness as the void increased.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  To see a clear effect, void was needed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…I guess I’ll have to rely on you a bit more. Seah.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan smiled wryly and then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Stab…!
 </p>
 <p>
  He stabbed his sword back into his face that had just barely recovered.

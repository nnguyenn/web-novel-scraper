  Chapter 502
 </p>
 <p>
  “U-Uncle, what are you doing!?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as Seong Jihan stabbed his face, Yoon Seah immediately appeared in the training room.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why are you hurting your face that just recovered…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  She was about to absorb the void again, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan lightly waved her off.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I need the void for training. Let’s heal later.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, I see…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, I’ll ask for your help when I’m done training.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s words, she looked at his face with anxious eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You understand, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She nodded with effort.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So don’t worry about me and focus on your own work. Why do you rush in as soon as I stab my face?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is more important than anything else.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can control this much. Don’t you have Space League games or national team matches to be busy with?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The weight that the world’s #1 ranked player had to bear wasn’t so light.
 </p>
 <p>
  She shouldn’t have the leisure to watch Seong Jihan’s every move like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  To his question, Yoon Seah answered nonchalantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, there is a Space League match going on right now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Going on, you say?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at Yoon Seah with a surprised face.
 </p>
 <p>
  Wait.
 </p>
 <p>
  How could she come here during a Space League match?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, but I just didn’t go. The opponents are Orcs anyway.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anyway, your void is more important than one of those matches, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah said this while carefully observing Seong Jihan’s broken face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s wrong with humanity coming in second? You raised us to the top tier anyway. We’re just finding our place. Isn’t it a problem if we lose without me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Still, you could absorb the void after going to the match. You’re not even participating?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What if the void suddenly overflows and your cracks widen? We can win the next match.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at Yoon Seah with a puzzled expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  His niece, who used to be a model student,
 </p>
 <p>
  Was now neglecting her duties as the world’s #1 ranked player to absorb the void from his face.
 </p>
 <p>
  Why was she suddenly acting like this?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Could it be because of the hat?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Could the void side be influencing her somehow to make her the definite owner of the Arena?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan asked her with a serious expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Haven’t you felt anything strange since becoming a Void Apostle?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh? What do you mean?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You didn’t used to be like this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you mean I wasn’t like this? I’ve always worried about you a lot, haven’t I?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah tilted her head at Seong Jihan’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But… you’re right. Something has changed. Before, I could only worry about what to do, but now I can really help, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, helping is good, but do it in moderation. People need to do their own work too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Not going to the representative team’s match and watching in real-time for void leakage,
 </p>
 <p>
  This was going too far.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan smiled bitterly, Yoon Seah hung her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I thought you were invincible, Uncle. Until I saw you being buried in the void and disappearing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, I ended up coming back to life anyway.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But when I saw you disappearing… It was shocking.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Her eyes trembled slightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “All this I’m enjoying… you made it all possible, right? I just received it. Mom went missing. Dad went to Japan… I thought I’d never see them both again. But you brought them all back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That was just what I had to do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is what I have to do too. I need to repay the kindness I’ve received so far. Especially.”
 </p>

 <p>
  Yoon Seah’s eyes turned to Seong Jihan’s face again.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll keep focusing on this until your face returns to normal.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I need to stay in this state until I finish training anyway.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then I’ll keep caring for you until then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…So you’re going to keep monitoring in real-time?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Real-time monitoring! It’s care. Care.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought as he listened to Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This, she’s not going to change her mind easily.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Was seeing him die at Dongbang Sak’s hands that shocking?
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah’s attitude about dedicating herself to caring for Seong Jihan was more stubborn than he thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if he said she didn’t need to care for him, she seemed determined to keep watching in real-time.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this situation, simply saying no wouldn’t work.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan tried to persuade her slowly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright, Seah. I appreciate your concern, but right now I need to train with the void, right? You should do your own work too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But it shouldn’t overflow, right? Don’t I need to keep watching?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll call you if I need you. I’ll ask you to come and absorb the void through your battletube, so you can come then, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, the battletube works here too…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If it doesn’t, you can just go out and turn on your battletube.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll call you through the battletube if it’s urgent, so do your own work.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s words, Yoon Seah chewed her lips.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Okay. Then I’ll come when you call me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She nodded with effort and retreated.
 </p>
 <p>
  After she left, Seong Jihan thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Once I unite Blue and Martial Soul, I should smash that hat first.’
 </p>
 <p>
  While he was genuinely grateful for Yoon Seah’s concern,
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t right for her to prioritize this over her own life.
 </p>
 <p>
  At this rate, his niece would be severely criticized by the public.
 </p>
 <p>
  He couldn’t bear to see that.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘As for my shattered face, I can probably fix it somehow by squeezing Gilgamesh.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking this, Seong Jihan replayed the battle with Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  His face was much more stern than before.
 </p>

 </p>
 <p>
  [TL/N: its what the Orc leader was recovering with]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Humanity drops to 2nd place in league rankings. GP exchange rate fluctuates greatly]

 <p>
  [Yoon Seah excluded from humanity’s representative team roster. Reason for absence: ‘Personal matters’]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Coach Davis comments, “We lacked firepower. Yoon Seah’s absence was regrettable.”]
 </p>
 <p>
  The match between humanity and Orcs.
 </p>
 <p>
  This game, which most of humanity expected to be an easy win, produced a completely unexpected result.
 </p>
 <p>
  -How can they not even win one game? lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -Seong Jihan easily crushed the Ancestor’s Blessing… why is this happening?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Sigh… I bet all my assets thinking we’d definitely win this time
 </p>
 <p>
  -I miss when Seong Jihan was around… back then you could just bet on victory and print money
 </p>
 <p>
  -But why didn’t Yoon Seah show up? What personal matter could it be?
 </p>
 <p>
  -I don’t know What could be more important than the Space League…
 </p>
 <p>
  A complete defeat in the Space League match without winning a single set.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps because everyone thought it would be an easy win,
 </p>
 <p>
  The aftermath of the defeat was severe.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow, how badly did they play to not even win one game?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’re one to talk, when you didn’t even go to the match?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, they should have at least beaten Orcs! Wow, I’m getting a lot of hate~”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah was looking at the comments under the news articles.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially on the article where the coach directly said “Yoon Seah’s absence was regrettable,” most were cursing at her.
 </p>
 <p>
  As she looked at this, instead of frowning, she was smiling slightly.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Seah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The master of the Daegi Guild, Lee Hayeon, rushed into the living room with a surprised face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, unnie. You’re here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh… you’re fine?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, yes. My condition is okay.”
 </p>
 <p>
  While saying this, she was looking at hate comments on her tablet PC.
 </p>
 <p>
  And on the screen next to it, she was watching Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sitting on the sofa as if looking at dual monitors, Lee Hayeon approached to see what she was watching and was surprised.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, it’s the Boss? That’s strange. He doesn’t use battletube…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, this is a screen only I can see. Uncle is in my training room.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh… is that so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon looked curiously at Seong Jihan training and then said to Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You… don’t tell me you missed today’s match because of the Boss’s training room?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah… something like that. I need to support Uncle.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I see. I thought it was strange that you’d miss a match.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon nodded and then frowned as she looked at the tablet PC Yoon Seah was holding.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you had told us in advance, you wouldn’t be getting all these hate comments. What a shame.”Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  “If I had told you in advance?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. If you had said you couldn’t play because you had to support the Boss, most people would have understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Space League matches were important for humanity,
 </p>
 <p>
  It still couldn’t compare to humanity’s first Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  If they had said she was absent to support him,
 </p>
 <p>
  Most people would have thought it was regrettable but unavoidable.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We should explain even now. If we say you couldn’t play because you were doing something related to the Boss, everyone will understand.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… but then Uncle will get blamed unnecessarily.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What… who would blame the Boss?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “People are already cursing at him.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thump. Thump.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah tapped her face while saying this.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Calling him a monster.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Seah. There are attention seekers everywhere. They enjoy it when people get upset at them cursing the Boss. Those kinds of hate comments probably don’t even make up 1% of the total.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even 1% is unacceptable to me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, who had been smirking at her own hate comments,
 </p>
 <p>
  Froze her face coldly when the 1% was mentioned.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘After the Boss’s face became like that, there were some “monster” comments… that must have bothered Seah.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon sighed deeply after seeing Yoon Seah’s state.
 </p>
 <p>
  For humanity, Seong Jihan currently held a status no different from a god.
 </p>
 <p>
  Extending lifespans, restoring health, eliminating dungeons.
 </p>
 <p>
  Religions believing in him were springing up like mushrooms, and humanity had received countless benefits from him, but
 </p>
 <p>
  There were still some who wanted to criticize him blindly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seah must have seen the ruckus caused by that tiny minority of people.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Seah. At that level, you can just consider it nonexistent. There’s no need to count the reactions of crazy people.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. So I’ll explain well about the reason for your absence.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, it’s okay. Let’s leave it as is, since Uncle might get blamed unnecessarily.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who would blame the Boss? It’ll be fine. If you don’t explain quickly, the hate comments will keep coming.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t really feel anything looking at them? Rather… it’s kind of fun?”
 </p>
 <p>
  She was grinning while looking at her own hate comments.
 </p>
 <p>
  She really didn’t seem affected at all by comments about herself.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Are you a masochist?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Maybe?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Haa. Don’t be like that and listen to me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Lee Hayeon tried to persuade Yoon Seah again,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  The Messenger appeared next to Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh… you’re here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah waved at the starfish-like being.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Black Administrator has responded to the previous inquiry. Where is the Blue Administrator?]
 </p>
 <p>
  He wriggled his body, looking for Seong Jihan.

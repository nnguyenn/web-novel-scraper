  Chapter 504
 </p>
 <p>
  [Star Buff has been upgraded to its limit, ‘Supernova’ is now permanently activated.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Supernova.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ultimate buff that increases Star Buff’s efficiency by 10 times.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, it had the drawback of losing the ‘Divine’ effect once used.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s why Seong Jihan saved it carefully after obtaining it and only used it when fighting the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But now they’re offering to activate it permanently.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, no matter how excellent Supernova is, its buff effect would be weaker now as an administrator compared to when he was a player.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, for Seong Jihan who was currently at an impasse, this was an incredibly tempting opportunity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, this effect came with a condition:
 </p>
 <p>
  [To maintain Supernova’s activation, the battletube must be turned on for at least 2 hours a day.]
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a condition forcing the activation of the battletube daily.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan quickly realized the meaning behind this.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They want to monitor my movements.’
 </p>
 <p>
  These days, he wasn’t even turning on the battletube, just training in the void training room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Did they become curious about his information?
 </p>
 <p>
  To offer such a buff just to watch him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Looking at this, White seems suspicious.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A Star Buff that forces the use of the battletube.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s an obviously suspicious offer.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If Star Buff is upgraded and Supernova activates, the performance of Heterogeneous Martial Resolve will also increase.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to take the risk for the completion of Blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  Besides,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The void training room and the Black Administrator are just as dubious anyway.’
 </p>
 <p>
  While he trusted Yoon Seah who operated the training room,
 </p>
 <p>
  He couldn’t trust the void side which was its source.
 </p>
 <p>
  As long as both Black and White had suspicious points,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to use everything offered by both sides while focusing entirely on completing Blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright, I’ll accept it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan answered and pressed yes,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Star Buff has been upgraded to its limit.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [When the battle tube is turned on, Supernova will be permanently activated.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [To maintain Supernova’s permanent activation, you must turn on the battletube for 2 hours a day.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Star Buff was upgraded to its limit with the condition related to Supernova attached.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should turn it on right away.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Now that he had run simulations as much as he could, and Heterogeneous Martial Resolve wasn’t activating anymore.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan turned on the battletube as soon as Star Buff was upgraded.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  -It’s been a while since Seong Jihan’s battle tube.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Where is this?
 </p>
 <p>
  -It feels similar to the training room he showed before.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Before, the broadcast played strangely due to the time multiplier, but today it’s normal?
 </p>
 <p>
  -But the screen border is glowing bright white, what’s this…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh, it’s not just me; mine’s sparkling too.
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers flooded in as soon as Seong Jihan started the broadcast.
 </p>
 <p>
  Those who guessed this place was the training room were amazed that the playback was normal, unlike before.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A bright white glowing border… is it the White Administrator?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Originally, the flow of time in the training room and outside was different, so the playback speed had to be adjusted.
 </p>
 <p>
  Was that white border correcting it somehow?
 </p>
 <p>
  The permanent administrator seemed to have nothing better to do.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was thinking this,
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is this because of the Yoon Seah absence incident?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why would Seong Jihan explain that;
 </p>
 <p>
  -For real, bringing that issue even here.
 </p>
 <p>
  When the Yoon Seah incident was mentioned in some parts of the chat,
 </p>
 <p>
  He twitched his eyebrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s this Yoon Seah incident? Are you talking about her not showing up for the national team match?”
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh, you know about it.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yes, we lost to Orcs because of that
 </p>
 <p>
  -This never happened when Seong Jihan was around…!!
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">

   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  People confirmed that was indeed what they were referring to in response to his question.
 </p>
 <p>
  As voices blaming Yoon Seah started to emerge, Seong Jihan frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Why isn’t she explaining herself and just taking the blame?’
 </p>
 <p>
  If they were talking about it even in Seong Jihan’s chat, she would be getting even more criticism in public.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I say she helped fix my face, the limited uses of the Golden Wheel might be revealed. I should give a vague explanation.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He gave a simple answer to people about this matter.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah was absent due to something related to my work. It’s also connected to providing this training room.”
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ah… so she was absent because of Seong Jihan’s issue.
 </p>
 <p>
  -I thought it was strange she’d just be absent for no reason.
 </p>
 <p>
  -If that’s the case, it’s understandable haha
 </p>
 <p>
  -The problem is losing just because Yoon Seah was missing, honestly;
 </p>
 <p>
  -For real, isn’t it embarrassing to lose just because one player is missing?
 </p>
 <p>
  While most people quickly changed their attitude and agreed with Seong Jihan’s words,
 </p>
 <p>
  -Even if it’s related to Seong Jihan, is it professional to miss a match?
 </p>
 <p>
  -What help could an administrator need from his niece anyway;
 </p>
 <p>
  -I don’t know what kind of help it was, but I lost all my assets because of this…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Don’t you not need a training room anymore at this point?
 </p>
 <p>
  A minority of people continued to raise objections in the chat.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was actually mild.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the chat, some were even calling him a monster because of his face.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan smiled wryly seeing this.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘These guys, I need to discipline them a bit.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Maybe he had been too nice to humans so far.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan crossed his arms and opened his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I turn on the broadcast after a long time, and I see some people cursing at me? Then I don’t feel like using my authority to help humanity… I guess this level of evolution is enough for you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who had raised humanity from the lowest-grade species to lower-middle grade.
 </p>
 <p>
  When he brandished his administrator authority, humanity was put on alert.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ah these crazy bastards ㅡㅡ;
 </p>
 <p>
  -Now they’re picking fights with Seong Jihan because there’s no one else to curse at, these lunatics for real.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Just go leave hate comments somewhere else… do you want to live until 200 or not?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Don’t kill the goose that lays golden eggs, damn it
 </p>
 <p>
  Sure enough, people react when you say something.
 </p>
 <p>
  He added one more thing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, and just in case, I’ll let you know that it’s possible to downgrade humanity’s rank. Administrator authority can do more than you think.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In reality, there was no need to waste authority to lower humanity’s rank, but
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan showed that he could do this if he wanted to.
 </p>
 <p>
  The chat quickly cleaned up.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ha, downgrade? That’s crossing the line.
 </p>
 <p>
  -That’s definitely a bluff, he can’t do it.
 </p>
 <p>
  -His face got smashed and became a monster, did his personality break too?
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, some still didn’t stop their criticism, but
 </p>
 <p>
  “Strangely, among those cursing, there are many IDs with neighboring country flags. Should I make an example of one of them first? Going back to lowest-grade would be fine, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan said he could target and downgrade a specific country, the chat quickly went quiet.
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  -Cursing at an administrator… are they crazy?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Didn’t they rise vertically from lowest-grade to lower-middle grade because of the administrator??
 </p>
 <p>
  -Abandon those guys and come to our planet. Blue Administrator, we will be your faithful servants.
 </p>
 <p>
  And seeing humanity’s reaction, alien species just invited him to come to them.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s how unthinkable this incident was by their common sense.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘World Tree Yggdrasil’ suggests pressing on the chat IDs and viewing the information of the governing species.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [He advises that even a temporary administrator should be able to view battletube information, and to not tolerate insubordination but eradicate three generations of the rebels.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Furthermore, the Green Administrator went a step further and explained how to use administrator authority in the battletube.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, our senior. You’re teaching me good things.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who only called Yggdrasil ‘senior’ when he did something he liked,
 </p>
 <p>
  Immediately proceeded with a test.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can understand other countries, but I was curious about some IDs from our country that are cursing so hard. Let’s see… Blancheshu? Let’s start with this ID. View information.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Viewing information of the governing species.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Zing…
 </p>
 <p>
  A status window popped up in front of his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Like a regular status window, it showed name, level, and abilities.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Name is Kim Heesu. Level 1… not an awakened one? But this name sounds familiar.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Who was Kim Heesu?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan tried to recall for a moment, then
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  [Do you want to use 1 Administrator Authority to view detailed information?]
 </p>
 <p>
  When the system message appeared, he pressed yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then on the status window he opened, the person’s face appeared in real-time,
 </p>
 <p>
  And additional information about their location was displayed.
 </p>
 <p>
  And Seong Jihan recognized who it was when he saw the face.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Ah, it’s that kid whose eyebrows I plucked before.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the friend who had picked a fight with Yoon Seah and got her eyebrows plucked by him.
 </p>
 <p>
  He clearly remembered teaching her and her cousin a lesson back then…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Humans really don’t change easily.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even after being scolded like that, she’s still doing this.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan considered revealing this face and status window to everyone, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Then the public would really go after this one person.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He decided not to go that far.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…!
 </p>
 <p>
  He covered Kim Hee-su’s face and name with his palm and revealed the status window to people.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thanks to our senior administrator, I got to see the status window well like this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow it really shows up
 </p>
 <p>
  -Administrator authority is insane…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Does the name end with ‘su’?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is it a man or woman?
 </p>
 <p>
  -With an ID like Blancheshu, isn’t it a woman?
 </p>
 <p>
  -If Seong Jihan moves his palm it’s basically a public execution lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -Didn’t Yggdrasil say to eradicate three generations?? Let’s go
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the status window of a level 1 ending with XX-su, people once again realized that Seong Jihan was an administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the public wanted Seong Jihan to remove his palm and reveal the face and name, but
 </p>
 <p>
  “If I reveal it, they might really die… I’m being nice, so I’ll let it slide this once. They’re still young, it’d be a shame to die so early.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing signs that a real 21st century witch hunt might occur, he decided not to fully reveal it.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘World Tree Yggdrasil’ advises that this is unnecessary mercy.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [He says it would be merciful to eradicate three generations of those who damaged the administrator’s dignity, and urges to reveal it immediately.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Green Administrator told him not to think about such things and just crush them, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll do it later if I’m in a bad mood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan smiled and dismissed the status window he had displayed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The reason he revealed the status window this time wasn’t to target Kim Heesu specifically.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was to show that ‘I can see all of you’.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Besides, if I go after one, I’d have to go after the rest too, and that would be a waste of authority.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He couldn’t use authority just to reveal information on such trolls.
 </p>
 <p>
  From the beginning, Seong Jihan didn’t really care much about people cursing at him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Compared to when I was on the US national team in my previous life, this is nothing.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Back then, because of the fierce ranking competition between countries, he heard all kinds of insults from people of other countries.
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to that time, the current chat environment was very clean.
 </p>
 <p>
  The only reason it bothered him this time was because Yoon Seah was being insulted.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it wasn’t for that, Seong Jihan wouldn’t have cared what insults people threw.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now that this matter is settled, let’s get to the main point.”
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh, that wasn’t the main point yet…
 </p>
 <p>
  -We got here because the Yoon Seah issue was brought up in the first place lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -I should capture the IDs of everyone who cursed at Seong Jihan
 </p>
 <p>
  -I wonder what would have happened to XX-su if their name was revealed?
 </p>
 <p>
  -For real, they might have died… for criticizing Seong Jihan in Korea lol
 </p>
 <p>
  While people were continuing to discuss the previous conversation, saying everything until now was just the introduction,
 </p>
 <p>
  Zing…
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan turned on the simulation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The characteristic of Heterogeneous Martial Resolve is activating.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Heterogeneous Martial Resolve, whose performance had increased along with the activation of Supernova, a characteristic of Star Buff,
 </p>
 <p>
  Was once again gaining stimulation from the simulation with Dongbang Sak, which had already been used like a soup stock.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Now… I can really complete it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan realized with certainty.
 </p>
 <p>
  That he could unify Blue and Martial Soul through this simulation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…I’ll be able to draw the Taiji Sword soon.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s eyes darkened as he looked at Dongbang Sak in the simulation.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was time for the final touch.
 </p>
 <p>
  And 5 weeks later.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The stat ‘Devil’s intrusion’ is completely absorbed into ‘Blue’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The training was complete.

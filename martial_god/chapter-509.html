  Chapter 509
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do I need to make a contract to hear more?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. This is my livelihood… If you don’t write a contract promising to spare my life, I absolutely won’t say anything more. Seong Jihun.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan pretended to contemplate while covering his twitching mouth with his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihun, huh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Changing the name with administrator privileges gets patched in real-time.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then write it clearly in the contract. That you’ll help operate the Tower of Babel and reveal the secret of Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit for certain.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good. You too, write Seong Jihun’s name clearly. This time, I absolutely won’t be fooled like before.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You said to write the BattleNet name too? How will you hide this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Still… just in case, reveal the name on your status window too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  This guy.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was being a bit more careful after being tricked last time.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Here, look.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan willingly opened his status window.
 </p>
 <p>
  And there,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Name: Seong Jihun]
 </p>
 <p>
  The modified name was at the top.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…It’s correct.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now you can trust me, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, you’re more truthful than Enkidu.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, right. Add one more thing. That I won’t be active in this area.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was planning that anyway. I’ll go to the area furthest from East Asia and won’t even look in this direction.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh spoke with more sincerity than ever before.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan smirked and opened his palm.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Add that clause and bring out the contract.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s words, Gilgamesh quickly took out the contract from his inventory.
 </p>
 <p>
  As if he had been waiting for this moment, his actions were unprecedentedly swift.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Contract for Transactions Between Constellation-level Beings]
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh, who took out a contract with the official BattleNet mark stamped on it,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Here… I added this clause.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After adding the clauses Seong Jihan requested, he handed it over.
 </p>
 <p>
  He briefly scanned it.
 </p>
 <p>
  The contract’s text was automatically translated into his native language, Korean.
 </p>
 <p>
  1. Party A guarantees Party B’s life and safety under any circumstances.
 </p>
 <p>
  Guaranteeing life and safety under any circumstances.
 </p>
 <p>
  The wording from the first clause was quite bothersome.
 </p>
 <p>
  This could mean Seong Jihan might have to protect Gilgamesh if things go wrong.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Normally I’d have to argue over each of these clauses and modify them. But I’ll be switching the name back anyway.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan noticed several other traps but ignored them since the problem would end once he rolled back the name from Seong Jihun.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… The Taiji Sword is about to fade. Alright. Let’s sign quickly. I should write myself as Party A, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed he looked at it too casually.
 </p>
 <p>
  He mentioned the Taiji Sword as an excuse for this.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh… Good! Then let’s do it right away!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh’s face immediately brightened.
 </p>
 <p>
  His expression became even brighter when Seong Jihan wrote the name Seong Jihun in Party A’s place.
 </p>
 <p>
  And after they both finished writing their names,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ziiing…!
 </p>
 <p>
  [A contract has been established between ‘Seong Jihun’ and ‘Gilgamesh’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A message announcing the contract establishment appeared in the system.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehe… You really signed it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh’s attitude became arrogant as soon as he signed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now that he judged he wouldn’t die, his original demeanor returned.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then you first, solve my curiosity.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s question, Gilgamesh raised his chin.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You mean about the difference between your Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit and mine? It’s because our calibers are different.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You know your life and safety are guaranteed even if I cut off your limbs and genitals, right? I don’t have time to joke around, so speak quickly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kh, khmm… Alright.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh, dropping his bluff and returning to his original attitude under Seong Jihan’s chilling aura,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t know exactly either, but it’s probably related to my gift.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Gift?”
 </p>
 <p>
  He suddenly mentioned his own gift.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. My gift is… the Red Vessel.”
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  “…The Red Vessel, you say?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Vessel.
 </p>
 <p>
  This,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s similar to… the Great Vessel of the Void?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Great Vessel of the Void that Yoon Seah had upgraded by maximizing her Late Bloomer gift.
 </p>
 <p>
  Isn’t this just the same with a different modifier in front?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Were you also a Late Bloomer gift holder?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha, Late Bloomer? I was a great vessel from birth.”
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  “…No, come to think of it, you weren’t even participating in BattleNet in your active days, were you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s true. I just became a Constellation later and when I looked at the gift section, it said Red Vessel.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Vessel.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was an unexpected gift, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This guy, I must kill him no matter what.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought even more that he had to deal with Gilgamesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Vessel, he said.
 </p>
 <p>
  This really, if left alive, who knew when the Red Administrator might pop out and use this guy.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It might be better to give up on moving through the Tower of Babel.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Moving through a Tower of Babel created by the Red Vessel felt somewhat unsettling.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was better to trust the proven Dongbang Sak after all.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Building the Tower of Babel itself might be able to draw Martial God’s attention…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan tried to predict the battle in Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Tower of Babel and the sword’s landing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the two methods of movement, he had already decided which was more efficient, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  Building the Tower of Babel seemed like it would draw Martial God’s attention considerably.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There’s only one chance to use Galactic Sword Scar. Maybe it’s better to completely draw Martial God’s attention and gather his power.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Giving up on going secretly through the two movement methods.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead, openly making Martial God prepare and using Galactic Sword Scar there.
 </p>
 <p>
  This might be the method that could deal the biggest blow to him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan started outlining the battle in Tuseong from the big picture.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he stood silently for a moment like that,
 </p>
 <p>
  “…You’re not planning to kill me because of the effect of Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit being due to the gift, are you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh misunderstood his silence and cautiously opened his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But no matter what, we’ve already signed the contract… so you can’t kill me. Right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The secret of Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit that could access the Red World Tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  All Gilgamesh had figured out was his own gift.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since this wasn’t an operating method applicable to Seong Jihan, he had reason to worry.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I won’t kill you or anything because of this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Y-Yes, you’ve thought well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Instead, let me see you make the Tower of Babel once.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll need some power for that… Will you provide it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh looked at Seong Jihan and grinned.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now that he was told he wouldn’t be killed, his spirit quickly revived.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I won’t move directly with that. It’s enough if it’s enough to make Martial God wary.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Still, I think I’ll need some life force. It’s a task of building a tower in such a distant place.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There was no mention of providing life force in the contract. Should I break the contract?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, ahem. Well. Why are you so harsh? Alright, alright. I’ll squeeze out all the power I have, even what I don’t have…”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan mentioned breaking the contract, Gilgamesh’s demand for power quickly retracted.
 </p>
 <p>
  He grumbled as he started to create the Tower of Babel.
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  “Without support, most of my body will disappear… Not just my arms and legs, but most of my torso will wither away too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So what?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you provide me with power, I could create the Golden Tower, no, the Tower of Babel without sacrifice…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s your problem. You’ll somehow desperately survive even if only your head remains anyway.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Khmm…! You know me too well, it’s troublesome.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh frowned at Seong Jihan’s remark.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, I’ll use a bit of power from that sealing formation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Because it’s almost impossible to construct the Tower of Babel without projecting my power through that open space.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Fine. Don’t do anything unnecessary.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why would I do anything unnecessary when I’m hoping you’ll leave so I can settle here with peace of mind?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh, sincerely wishing for Seong Jihan to leave,
 </p>
 <p>
  Put his hand into the sealing formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash…!
 </p>
 <p>
  And as golden light seemed to leak from his body,
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud thud thud thud…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The land of Tuseong in the screen began to writhe.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s quite peculiar.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The power Gilgamesh currently possesses isn’t even 10% of his prime, yet,
 </p>
 <p>
  He could build the Tower of Babel so easily on the distant Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, he said he was doing it through the sealing formation, but still, it was amazing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan watched this and asked Gilgamesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  “By the way, what’s the original purpose of that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It has many uses, but basically it’s a device to control subordinates.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Like when people were mentally controlled when summoned to Seouleung?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Similar. It’s quite useful for smooth governance. Want me to install one in your territory?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why would I?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even if you’re an administrator, you’ll need something like this to perfectly control humans.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh firmly believed that Seong Jihan would rule over humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No thanks, it’s troublesome to rule over anything.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan said this and looked at the screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Tower of Babel began to form, he noticed the Constellation relics moving towards it.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sword’s landing point and the Tower of Babel.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  Martial God was preparing for both areas.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihun, at this rate, Martial God will perfectly set traps in those areas. Wouldn’t it be better to provide me with some life force and move quickly instead?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing this, Gilgamesh again begged for life force.
 </p>
 <p>
  He really asked for power at every opportunity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan ignored Gilgamesh’s words and watched Martial God prepare.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Tower of Babel and the sword’s landing area.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps because the two locations weren’t that far apart, Martial God had gathered quite a lot of Constellation relics there.
 </p>
 <p>
  This should be enough to deal a blow with Galactic Sword Scar in one go.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s about time to go now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, seeing Martial God’s forces gathered, decided it was time to depart.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then before that,
 </p>
 <p>
  He should deal with Gilgamesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan deactivated the administrator privilege ‘Name Change’ and opened his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Gilgamesh, what’s my name?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your name? Seong…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gilgamesh started saying “Seong” naturally but
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hun… No, Han? S-Seong Jihan? W-Wait!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Then he took out the contract.
 </p>
 <p>
  “W-What is this. It’s written as Seong Jihun…! You, what on earth did you…!”nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
 </p>
 <p>
  “You gave me the hint. You said you were tricked by name switching.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “S-So I even checked with the BattleNet status window…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Because I’m an administrator, you see. Temporary modification was possible.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  Along with those words, the Phoenix Spear appeared in Seong Jihan’s left hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing this, Gilgamesh stepped back.
 </p>
 <p>
  “T-This isn’t right…! I cooperated with you fully this time. J-Just let me live. It’s fine even if only my head remains! I won’t even come near your territory. So…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I actually hesitated a bit, but your gift is the problem.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “M-My gift… Why is the Red Vessel…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Because I don’t know how the Red Administrator might use it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With those final words,
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Phoenix Spear pierced through Gilgamesh’s chest.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You… bastard…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ve lived long enough, now rest. Gilgamesh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This… can’t be…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Before Gilgamesh could finish his words, flames erupted from his body.
 </p>
 <p>
  Blue and red intermingled flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  The power that rose from the Phoenix Flag instantly turned Gilgamesh’s body to dust.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Now he should be completely dead.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Since he’s someone who could regenerate even from small body fragments,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan checked the place where Gilgamesh died once more.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Nothing. Definitely.’
 </p>
 <p>
  And seeing no trace of him left,
 </p>
 <p>
  He confirmed Gilgamesh’s annihilation and looked at the image of Tuseong reflected in the sealing formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Tower of Babel that had been rising as the land shook,
 </p>
 <p>
  Was about to disappear along with Gilgamesh’s demise.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s go.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan stuck the Taiji Sword into the sealing formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  The location he aimed to land was directly facing the Tower of Babel,
 </p>
 <p>
  The area that seemed to have the most of Martial God’s traps laid.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he confirmed his position,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Light shone from the Taiji Sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Infinite Annihilation God
 </p>
 <p>
  Heart Method
 </p>
 <p>
  Mind Creates All
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s body was sucked into the sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the sword moved on its own,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ziiik…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the sealing formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  It pierced straight through to the designated landing point.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Martial God’s star, Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Martial God was on edge due to the suddenly appearing Tower of Babel and
 </p>
 <p>
  The strange aura felt from above,
 </p>
 <p>
  Chiiik…!
 </p>
 <p>
  A sword of light tore through space and stuck directly into the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  […You’ve come.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As Martial God spoke upon seeing this,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssssk…
 </p>
 <p>
  Beside the Taiji Sword,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan revealed himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s end this, Martial God.”

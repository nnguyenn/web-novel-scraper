  Chapter 510
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, having landed on Tuseong, surveyed his surroundings.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the sky above this desolate star, the Constellation relics were densely floating.
 </p>
 <p>
  Two red lights, like eyes, moved as they watched him from above.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed Martial God had already merged with Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It looks like the Devil’s Intrusion has been lifted.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The distortion of ‘Red’ had spiked and then dropped.
 </p>
 <p>
  Had Dongbang Sak’s Devil’s Intrusion also been dispelled?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan assessed the power of Martial God felt from Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He is definitely weaker than when first summoned.’
 </p>
 <p>
  When he was summoned to Tuseong during his player days,
 </p>
 <p>
  Martial God had far more Constellation relics, and his power was overwhelming.
 </p>
 <p>
  But now, perhaps because he had been struck twice by Ashoka and Dongbang Sak,
 </p>
 <p>
  He didn’t seem to possess the same overwhelming strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Even so, he remains an opponent to be dealt with using full strength.’
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how weakened he appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  The power amassed through infinite reincarnation was still sustaining him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though Seong Jihan had made vast progress becoming the Blue Administrator,
 </p>
 <p>
  He couldn’t take that power lightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It would’ve been better if the Devil’s Intrusion had continued to affect him.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought this as he spoke up to the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Martial God, where is the Red Administrator?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Why are you asking me about him?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wasn’t it the Red who lifted your Devil’s Intrusion?”
 </p>
 <p>
  […Why don’t you think I might have lifted it myself?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “It was the Red who did it, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [….]
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s confident assertion, the two fiercely glowing red lights in the sky could only remain silent.
 </p>
 <p>
  After staring at those lights, he questioned about the Red Administrator once more.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So where is he now, that Red guy?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I don’t know. He has disappeared.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned at this response.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had hoped to deal with everything at once, but things had become bothersome.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Still, it’s better than facing a joint attack from both of them.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Judging this, Seong Jihan activated BattleTube.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Star Buff and Supernova upgraded by the White Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before the battle, he decided to benefit from those effects.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh, it’s the first broadcast since the training room.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Hey, but where is this place?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Isn’t it… the place where Martial God resides, Tuseong?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Looking at the weapons floating in the sky, it seems so;
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers, who had been eagerly watching the first broadcast since the Void training grounds, quickly figured out the location after seeing the surrounding scenery on the screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  The star of Martial God, Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  Had Ashoka not been there last time, this place would have become his grave indeed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I turned on BattleTube mainly for the buff. I hope you understand if I don’t respond much.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After saying this, Seong Jihan raised the Taiji Sword and pointed it toward the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Today, I will capture Martial God.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a dazzling flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the light from the Light Sword intensified,
 </p>
 <p>
  Martial God in the sky spoke with a voice full of majesty.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I will be the one to subdue you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead of directly responding,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Constellation relics displayed a peculiar movement.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Avoiding?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather than confronting the point of the sword head-on,
 </p>
 <p>
  The relics started scattering in all directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Was he wary of Dongbang Sak’s Taiji Sword?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm, I intended to lure him and neutralize him with a single blow from Galactic Sword Scar.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The opponent wouldn’t respond so simply.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was seemingly showing that he was preparing for Seong Jihan, but in reality,
 </p>
 <p>
  He was being exceptionally cautious of the Galactic Sword Scar that the Taiji Sword might unleash.
 </p>
 <p>
  Martial God may not fully understand what the sword technique left behind was, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing Seong Jihan wielding the Taiji Sword, he suspected it would unleash a mighty blow.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Then, even if I use the Galactic Sword Scar on the sky, it might not be as effective against Martial God as I thought.’
 </p>
 <p>
  There was only one opportunity to use the Galactic Sword Scar.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the opponent responded this cautiously, it might be wiser to wait until his forces were fully gathered to use it efficiently.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But the Taiji Sword won’t last long.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Taiji Sword, drawn from the sealing formation, had lost its power source.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if Seong Jihan infused it with the power of Eternity, it could hold out a bit longer, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering the Taiji Sword had dried up the Red World Tree,
 </p>
 <p>
  Investing power into it wasn’t efficient.
 </p>

 <p>
  It demanded too much to be maintained.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…If I were to target something better than the sky.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan’s gaze slowly lowered from the sky,
 </p>
 <p>
  With the amplified strength from BattleTube and the immeasurable destructive power of Galactic Sword Scar,
 </p>
 <p>
  This power could indeed bring down the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…I can aim for something greater than just the sky.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s gaze fell to the land beneath his feet.
 </p>
 <p>
  The star Tuseong, ruled by Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ordinarily, it’s not something anyone would consider cutting down, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘With this sword, it’s possible.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was convinced.
 </p>
 <p>
  With Dongbang Sak’s Taiji Sword,
 </p>
 <p>
  Unleashing Galactic Sword Scar,
 </p>
 <p>
  He could indeed slice through Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  The Taiji symbol floated behind Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the light of the Taiji Sword ascended towards the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dongbang Sak… Even in death, you thwart me to the end!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Shuuu…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing this, Martial God bellowed in anger.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the Constellation relics parted orderly to either side, avoiding the light.
 </p>
 <p>
  Intent on evading the Taiji Sword’s attack at all costs.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Huh? Is he really avoiding that?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Every time he ran away, just like before.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
 </p>
 <p>
  -When he dodged during Seong Jihan’s player days, I was speechless.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is this what being the God of Martial Arts means…?
 </p>
 <p>
  When the viewers saw Martial God’s nimble evasive maneuvers, they voiced their disbelief.
 </p>
 <p>
  They thought Seong Jihan’s attack had failed when,
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, the light from the Taiji Sword ceased,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Taiji symbol behind Seong Jihan seemed to distort,
 </p>
 <p>
  And the black and white, clearly divided, Yin and Yang, united as one.
 </p>
 <p>
  Infinite Annihilation God
 </p>
 <p>
  Taiji Sword
 </p>
 <p>
  Galactic Sword Scar
 </p>
 <p>
  Pa-a-a-t…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, the form of the Taiji Sword completely vanished.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Huh? What’s this…
 </p>
 <p>
  -The sword disappeared?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Did the skill… fail?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh, no…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Will the ultimate sword end like this…?
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers witnessed the sword disappear, believing Seong Jihan’s attack had failed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [What in the world…]
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the two red lights in the sky began to descend.
 </p>
 <p>
  And along with it,
 </p>
 <p>
  The land of Tuseong,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Babel Tower before his eyes,
 </p>
 <p>
  And even the sky,
 </p>
 <p>
  All split in half simultaneously.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow…
 </p>
 <p>
  -What did I just see?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Did that planet just get sliced in two…?
 </p>
 <p>
  -When the sword vanished, I thought the skill had failed;
 </p>
 <p>
  -I should’ve taken a photo when the sword glowed over the west sea…
 </p>
 <p>
  The power of Galactic Sword Scar, live-streamed on BattleTube, far exceeded everyone’s expectations.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This… was meant to just cut through Tuseong, but it split everything.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Galactic Sword Scar.
 </p>
 <p>
  Far more powerful than he had anticipated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked down.
 </p>
 <p>
  The split earth could no longer support him stably.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Time to lift off from the ground.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Whik!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan rose into the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ziiiing…
 </p>
 <p>
  The trajectory of Galactic Sword Scar belatedly shone.
 </p>
 <p>
  A faint outline with a brilliant white glow bordered in blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  It split Tuseong completely.
 </p>
 <p>
  And even more, it illuminated the sky with a majestic light.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though not visible now,
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

 <p>
  That light surely extended below the split Tuseong as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is… Galactic Sword Scar.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A grand name for a martial art involving swordsmanship, but
 </p>
 <p>
  After seeing it used, it was justified.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan calmly watched the lingering light.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shoo…!
 </p>
 <p>
  From afar, the Constellation relics began getting drawn toward the light of Galactic Sword Scar.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Damn… Come out! Why… Why can’t I control this…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The red light in the sky frantically tried to control the relics, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the attempt, the relics continued to gather into Galactic Sword Scar’s light.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I didn’t expect it to have this effect too?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Not only did it split Tuseong,
 </p>
 <p>
  It was also gathering and destroying the relics outside the range.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak’s design truly held unimaginable power.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Once again, deeply in your debt, Dongbang Sak.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan gave a slight bow toward the light and observed Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  The once overwhelming power seen in their first encounter was now more than halved,
 </p>
 <p>
  No, greatly diminished.
 </p>
 <p>
  And it would weaken further over time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead of waning, Galactic Sword Scar continued to shine, absorbing the relics.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Dongbang Sak almost took care of everything.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan watched the light, now drawing the split Tuseong and the relics closer.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had prepared thoroughly before coming here.
 </p>
 <p>
  But it seemed to end more easily than expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan approached the light where the red glow was.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dongbang Sak set the stage so perfectly; it needed to be concluded properly.
 </p>
 <p>
  When he ascended to the sky,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Cro…]
 </p>
 <p>
  The enormous form of a snake appeared around the remaining red light.
 </p>
 <p>
  Specifically, the snake, split in half by Galactic Sword Scar.
 </p>
 <p>
  Its red eyes quivering in pain.
 </p>
 <p>
  [What kind of sword is that…]
 </p>
 <p>
  With a feeble voice, the snake asked Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a sword left by Dongbang Sak. He called it Galactic Sword Scar.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [To think he would create such a sword… I should have eliminated him instead of trying to use him…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Regretting it now won’t change anything.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […]
 </p>
 <p>
  Chii-ik…
 </p>
 <p>
  Radiant light engulfed the snake’s split wounds.
 </p>
 <p>
  Marks of the sword preventing its regeneration.
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon closer inspection, Martial God couldn’t heal his wounds.
 </p>
 <p>
  How could he control the relics then?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Here, I just need to deliver the finishing blow.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  The Taiji symbol reappeared behind Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the sight, the snake flinched.
 </p>
 <p>
  When the black Taiji Sword manifested in his hand,
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s… your sword.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The snake visibly relaxed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This guy’s reaction is so predictable.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Relieved it wasn’t Dongbang Sak’s Taiji Sword, huh?
 </p>
 <p>
  Though understandable considering what happened, seeing his reaction made Seong Jihan want to demonstrate its power.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But there’s nothing much to cut down now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The snake, split by Galactic Sword Scar, had half of its body already sucked into the light.
 </p>
 <p>
  The remaining half flailed ineffectively with its wounds.
 </p>
 <p>
  A single effective strike would end the battle on Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s finish this quickly.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Pa-a-at…
 </p>
 <p>
  Blue energy swirled around Seong Jihan’s sword,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ready to sever the remaining snake.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Before the snake’s head, red flames erupted.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You are indeed merciless.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The flames subsided,
 </p>
 <p>
  Revealing a giant red eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  [How can a god of martial arts not even withstand a single strike? Failing to even buy time. Tsk, tsk…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…You.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s been a while, Blue Administrator.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You must be the Red Administrator.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Correct. Seems my creation fell short of your expectations.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Spark…
 </p>
 <p>
  The red eye glimmered,
 </p>
 <p>
  And blood-red droplets began to fall.
 </p>
 <p>
  [But… things will be different now.]

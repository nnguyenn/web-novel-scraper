  Chapter 512
 </p>
 <p>
  The Completed Vessel.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the gift that the Red Administrator required to rebuild the Hell.
 </p>
 <p>
  Had Gilgamesh possessed the Red Vessel, the matter would have been easily resolved.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was unfortunately the Blue Administrator who completely shattered that vessel.
 </p>
 <p>
  The remaining vessel belonged to the Void, and touching it was problematic.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But maybe I should check it just in case.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator, who had taken the form of a red giant, reverted back to his eye form.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a single leap through space, he arrived above Seoul.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There it is.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash…!
 </p>
 <p>
  A red light sprang from his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon, the Red Administrator spotted Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Why isn’t the screen showing anything? Did something happen to uncle?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s strange that only one specific channel on BattleTube has stopped… I’ll report this to the Black Administrator.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Eh? Why would we need to consult the Black Administrator?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [BattleTube is under the jurisdiction of the White Administrator. If it’s not a server-wide issue but just one channel that’s stopped, it might be because of his intentions. This gives the Black Administrator a reason to step in.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why can’t he intervene before this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [There are circumstances that prevent that…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, chatting with the Messenger while the screen of Seong Jihan’s channel would not display.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then…
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hmm…?]
 </p>
 <p>
  When the starfish turned to look this way, the Red Administrator quickly withdrew the red light.
 </p>
 <p>
  He couldn’t let the Void side catch wind of his whereabouts yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Who would have expected that he’d have a Messenger stationed at the side of the Void Vessel Yoon Seah?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, already designated by the hat, had a Messenger beside her, receiving an excessive amount of care from the Void.
 </p>
 <p>
  It would indeed be impossible to secretly steal that vessel without the Void noticing.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to think of another method.’
 </p>
 <p>
  There wasn’t much time.
 </p>
 <p>
  For now, the White Administrator had sealed Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  But once the Messenger contacted the Black Administrator, there would be a reaction from that side too.
 </p>
 <p>
  The White Administrator said they wouldn’t confront the Black side directly until the Hell was reconstructed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Great Sponsor’s support won’t be available to me any longer either.’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm… Maybe I should rearrange the order of operations.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator mused for a moment before quickly finding a solution.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  Light sparkled in his red eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  He again leapt through space to another location.
 </p>
 <p>
  The place he arrived was above Washington, D.C., the capital of the USA.
 </p>
 <p>
  The red eyes looked down below.
 </p>
 <p>
  There…
 </p>
 <p>
  Tourists were swarming in one place.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this the place? The place with the invitation obelisk?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [PR/N: Obelisk is a stone statue/monument.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, someone mentioned it looked like an obelisk, it really does.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “More famous than the White House in Washington… so many people.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At the site where people gathered and took photos, there stood the ‘Invitation from BattleNet’ that descended upon the capital when humanity was invited to BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  In reality, it was more of an enigmatic obelisk made of mysterious minerals than an invitation.
 </p>
 <p>
  On all sides, the words of BattleNet’s invitation shone brightly in English letters.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s really in English… ‘Humanity is invited to BattleNet.’”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Would it change to Korean if our country becomes the world number one?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, would it change that much? I thought only the broadcast and system interface would change.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who knows? Maybe the invitation would move to Seoul.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But now that Seong Jihan is no longer a player, can we really reclaim the number one spot?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Still, BattleTube isn’t working?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, why is that? It’s just Seong Jihan’s channel.”
 </p>
 <p>
  While Korean tourists discussed the invitation from BattleNet,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Eh…? That, the text on the invitation… turned red?”
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the tourists exclaimed with widened eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s this…? Did the text color just change?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The phrase, ‘Humanity is invited to BattleNet,’ which glowed white,
 </p>
 <p>
  Began to turn red, starting from the letters at the top.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Does the color usually change?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Some tourists, pointing at the ‘invitation,’ turned to the American guide and asked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ve never seen this phenomenon before. It could be dangerous, could you please step back?”
 </p>
 <p>
  With serious expressions, as they watched the text turn bright red, they hastily dispersed the tourists.
 </p>
 <p>
  What remained were U.S. government officials and BattleNet Association representatives.
 </p>

 <p>
  “The text is turning red continuously… Have you contacted the Association?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They said they will send researchers right away. They even asked if it converted to Korean yet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ah.
 </p>
 <p>
  Could it be that Korea has reached the first rank, causing the interface letters to change?
 </p>
 <p>
  As the text color continuously changed to red without any other noticeable changes,
 </p>
 <p>
  BattleNet Association representatives lived under that misconception.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, we still hold the first rank.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Maybe Seong Jihan defeated Martial God, and Korea got the points?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, is the invitation’s text changing first instead of the system? But he’s an Administrator, so there shouldn’t be a nationality bonus…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As people piled up fruitless conjectures,
 </p>
 <p>
  The text on the invitation steadily turned red.
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  [Keuuu… Ehh…]
 </p>
 <p>
  The enormous snake, impaled by Constellation relics, lost its sanity and could barely groan.
 </p>
 <p>
  The power he possessed was not to be underestimated.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s a good thing I used the Galactic Sword Scar to destroy much of his power… Otherwise, I would’ve been dead by now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Had the Martial God gone mad like this without the effects of the Red Administrator’s influence, even Seong Jihan himself would have struggled against such power.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan regenerated wounds on his body and watched the Martial God,
 </p>
 <p>
  Sssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  Some relics embedded in the snake began to detach.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Here it comes again.’
 </p>
 <p>
  From the relics suspended in mid-air, each glowed intensely.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  From each relic, powerful strikes burst forth.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘All the attacks belong to the Triad of Martial Mastery.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God’s assault.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having acquired part of Dongbang Sak’s weapon techniques like Seong Jihan through Martial Soul, such moves weren’t particularly impressive.
 </p>
 <p>
  The problem, if any, was the excessive power behind them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even when attempting to avoid them, the martial pressure from all directions was relentless.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was inevitably confronted by each attack.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still…
 </p>
 <p>
  Infinite Annihilation God
 </p>
 <p>
  Dark Shadow Technique
 </p>
 <p>
  Dark Soul Vortex
 </p>
 <p>
  As a vortex emerged from the Taiji Devil Sword created in the void,
 </p>
 <p>
  most of the Martial God’s attacks were sucked into it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though the Martial God had the upper hand in terms of the sheer power of the martial arts,DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  the level of martial skill was now clearly different.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That’s the limitation when you just rely on the Triad of Martial Mastery after obtaining Dongbang Sak’s martial arts.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Triad of Martial Mastery was a fundamental technique refined to the extreme in terms of stabbing and slashing,
 </p>
 <p>
  it was hard to deliver a meaningful strike to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  It could not be considered a truly threatening opponent by this alone.
 </p>
 <p>
  But…
 </p>
 <p>
  [Kraaaah…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the snake opened its mouth wide,
 </p>
 <p>
  a gathering of red light was shot towards Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Total Annihilation used by the Red Administrator as a weapon of attack.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God was also manifesting it without difficulty.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is truly threatening.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Seong Jihan swiftly dodged the Total Annihilation,
 </p>
 <p>
  the firepower was so immense that he couldn’t avoid getting scorched.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan regenerated his burned skin while thinking,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Despite Blue having an inherent advantage over Red, it’s tough to block.’
 </p>
 <p>
  When Dongbang Sak fought against the Red Administrator, he easily sliced through using Blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the Total Annihilation shot by the Martial God was oddly difficult to defend with Blue alone.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is something else mixed into the Martial God’s Total Annihilation…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The wild pressure of the berserk Martial God was out of control,
 </p>
 <p>
  thus the Total Annihilation was not emitting its original precision power.
 </p>
 <p>
  If Seong Jihan possessed equal strength to the Martial God, he could output Total Annihilation that could overwhelm him.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, maybe because of the opponent’s immense power,
 </p>
 <p>
  Total Annihilation mixed haphazardly, making it more difficult to handle.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Still, stalling for time itself isn’t difficult.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The martial arts exhibited by the Martial God through the Constellation relics were all derived from Dongbang Sak.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, having acquired his weapon techniques, could easily handle this.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Total Annihilation coming intermittently from the snake’s mouth was powerful,
 </p>
 <p>
  but it could still be dealt with from a distance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even as the Martial God rampantly unleashed power,
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})

 </div>
 <p>
  Season Jihan was confident he wouldn’t die.
 </p>
 <p>
  By managing like this, Martial God couldn’t maintain that state indefinitely.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Constellation relics amplifying his power,
 </p>
 <p>
  as well as his berserk state, would eventually come to an end.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Dragging this out indefinitely isn’t feasible due to lack of leisure on my part.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If it weren’t for the Red Administrator, he might not have said,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I have much to do and must leave.’
 </p>
 <p>
  There wasn’t time to keep battling with the Martial God inside this veil of light.
 </p>
 <p>
  Somehow, the battle with him needed to be quickly resolved.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then it would be feasible to handle the Red Administrator as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to switch to offense using more power.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Sssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  Cracks began to form on Seong Jihan’s face, and the void within the Taiji Sword was greatly amplified.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Kraaaahah…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Together with a scream, a torrential bombardment from the Martial God ensued.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This follows the lineage of the Light Sword…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Truly, this thing solely depended on Dongbang Sak for everything.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan threw himself into the onslaught, approaching the snake’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though blood flowed from his whole body due to the powerful resistance, he managed to close the distance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Immediately, he extended the Taiji Sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Chiieeek…!
 </p>
 <p>
  He completely severed the snake’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Kraaaak…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God screamed as he was bisected.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having lost his mind, he was nothing more than a gigantic monster now.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan didn’t stop, he continued his offensive.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pssshhht…
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the relics embedded in the snake disintegrated completely.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  The bulk of the Martial God’s body bathed in a bright light and was moved far away.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  The snake quickly began to regenerate.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Just when he thought he had completely sliced it apart, there was a sudden activation of white light and spatial movement.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s powers couldn’t stop it.
 </p>
 <p>
  The spatial movement activated on the Martial God was of a different caliber.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan stilled his gaze and looked up at the sky veiled with light.
 </p>
 <p>
  “White Administrator. If you’re going to intervene like this, why don’t you come out and fight yourself?”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s words,
 </p>
 <p>
  Rustle. Rustle…
 </p>
 <p>
  Just a slow movement of the white veil.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seemingly without any intention to show up personally, it appeared he only intervened when the Martial God was on the verge of death.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If you’re almost showing up so openly, what’s the problem with not fighting directly?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The White Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  Could there be some restrictions?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan contemplated briefly while looking at the veil of light.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Grrrrr…]
 </p>
 <p>
  He then turned his gaze back to the Martial God, now utterly beast-like.
 </p>
 <p>
  The regenerated snake was in a state where one relic of the Constellation was completely extinguished.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed the White Administrator used that power to save Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  Continuing to slash at the Martial God in this manner, once all the Constellation relics burst from its body, perhaps the snake would eventually die.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The problem is, there are too many relics embedded in its body.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Just by the number of weapons embedded in the snake’s body, it had hundreds of lives.
 </p>
 <p>
  No, likely more.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fighting like this, although eventually defeating the Martial God was possible, it would take too much time, preventing him from thwarting the Red Administrator’s plans.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘With a normal exchange of offense and defense, it won’t end…’
 </p>
 <p>
  To suppress the enemy quickly, extraordinary measures were necessary.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Kraaaak…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the snake once again opened its mouth wide, a burst of red light emerged.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even the power of Blue couldn’t fully defend against the Martial God’s Total Annihilation.
 </p>
 <p>
  It would usually be necessary to avoid this and counterattack.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…It seems I have to use the Golden Wheel.’
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no more time to delay.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan bit his lip and charged into the Total Annihilation.
 </p>
 <p>
  His final target was inside the vast mouth of the snake.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Inside the snake, I’ll subdue him.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Whooooosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s body was engulfed and burned by the Total Annihilation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Particularly his left face completely collapsed and was filled with the void.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s body entered inside the mouth of the snake.
 </p>

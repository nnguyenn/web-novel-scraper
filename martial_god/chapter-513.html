  Chapter 513
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan entered the mouth of the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Reflexively, a white light exploded inside the snake’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once again, the space surrounding Martial God shifted.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems I’m being taken along too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The teleportation included Seong Jihan, who had fully entered into Martial God’s domain.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It feels like the whole area is being moved. My hunch was right.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The teleportation intervened by the White Administrator,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan deduced it was moving not just the entity of Martial God but the entire domain he belonged to.
 </p>
 <p>
  His guess was spot on at this moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is this also because I inherited Dongbang Sak’s weapon techniques?’
 </p>
 <p>
  In the past, it would have been difficult to discern the subtle warping of space.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, since his foundational technique evolved into Infinite Annihilation God, Seong Jihan felt his senses had become significantly amplified.
 </p>
 <p>
  Enough to realize that the White Administrator’s teleportation had moved the entire domain, not just an individual.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Total Annihilation flared up again inside the relocated mouth of the snake, but
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’m going for the Golden Wheel if I’m about to die.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to use just one coin and blatantly amplified the Black Taiji Sword inside its head.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Black sword light soared above the giant snake’s head.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Kraaaahah…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Screams of the Martial God filled the area.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a resolve to face death once, the Taiji Sword he wielded seriously left no chance for the Martial God, who was already inferior to Seong Jihan in martial prowess.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash! Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching Seong Jihan emitting the Taiji Sword from inside the snake’s head,
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though the White Administrator tried different tactics to relocate Martial God separately,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where do you think you’re going on your own?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan instinctively recognized which region was being moved and which wasn’t.
 </p>
 <p>
  He threw himself into the moving area to be taken along.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, the White Administrator’s teleportation couldn’t separate Seong Jihan any longer.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Grrr… Grrrrr…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  From the mouth of the snake, a more potent Total Annihilation began to emerge.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s body had already been disappearing and regenerating countless times due to his inability to fully counter the previous Total Annihilation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Touching it now seemed like regeneration would be difficult.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he valued his life, he would have to escape from the snake’s head right now, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s time to use one coin.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking that it would become even harder to capture the Martial God if he fled now, Seong Jihan decided to use the Golden Wheel.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  His entire body set ablaze,
 </p>
 <p>
  And when the crack on the left side of his face finally burst open,
 </p>
 <p>
  Sssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  As the void overflowed, it began to counter the Total Annihilation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s body, blackened by burning, could not move,
 </p>
 <p>
  But the purple void amplified endlessly, enlarging the Taiji Sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this situation,
 </p>
 <p>
  To an outsider, it might appear as nothing more than a final struggle in an already lost battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But I am still conscious.‘
 </p>
 <p>
  Ignoring the pain all over his body, Seong Jihan focused on one thing only.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fill the Taiji Sword with this overflowing void to complete it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having decided to use the Golden Wheel, he might as well make full use of it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though half of his body had disappeared, the Taiji Sword flared up more intensely,
 </p>
 <p>
  And the Constellation relics behind the snake continued to be destroyed.
 </p>
 <p>
  By this point, Seong Jihan’s attack seemed almost a mutual destruction.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Kr…Grrrrr…]
 </p>
 <p>
  The snake, only capable of spewing flames from its mouth,
 </p>
 <p>
  Was unable to respond further.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fsshshsh…
 </p>
 <p>
  As the relics embedded in the snake’s back disappeared due to the Taiji Sword,
 </p>
 <p>
  And the snake’s body was cut and regenerated repeatedly,
 </p>
 <p>
  The last remaining fragment of Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even the left side of his face was about to disappear, unable to withstand the Total Annihilation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is this the end?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Though he had filled the Taiji Sword with ample void.
 </p>
 <p>
  It hadn’t been finalized inside the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just infusing power wasn’t enough to complete it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as Seong Jihan was about to disappear,
 </p>
 <p>
  Behind him,
 </p>
 <p>
  Rollroll…
 </p>
 <p>
  A golden wheel arose.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  From this moment up to 24 hours back,
 </p>
 <p>
  He could set the timeline, moving his body’s condition and location through the Golden Wheel.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The veil of light may not be penetrable, but regeneration within this domain is entirely possible.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With that thought, Seong Jihan decided to use one of the remaining two opportunities.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, as the wheel turned backwards,
 </p>
 <p>
  Time rewound, and his body began to revert to its original state.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Ah.‘
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s mind became incredibly clear.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Golden Wheel, which forcibly implemented Ashoka’s enlightenment,
 </p>
 <p>
  Once it activated properly, he melded with it, enabling a moment of expansive thinking.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This could work.’
 </p>
 <p>
  How to utilize the Taiji Sword, which he had only been filling with void without completing,
 </p>
 <p>
  He had a hunch on what to do.
 </p>
 <p>
  A method only possible in the current moment of using the Golden Wheel.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s do this.‘
 </p>
 <p>
  Sssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  The immensely amplified Taiji Sword rapidly diminished,
 </p>
 <p>
  And the condensed void within the sword began to whirl intensely.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Grrr…]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Taiji Sword piercing his head disappeared,
 </p>
 <p>
  The snake, which had been groaning in pain, felt a moment of relief, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoooosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the sword’s form collapsed, converging at a single point, the Taiji Sword began to suck in everything around it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not just everything inside the snake’s mouth,
 </p>
 <p>
  But even the Golden Wheel moving behind Seong Jihan started to be drawn into the void singularity.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘At this rate, I might even get sucked in.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Whooshl…
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Golden Wheel spun rapidly, and Seong Jihan’s form vanished,
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the void singularity,
 </p>
 <p>
  Sssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  Black and white separated, and the emblem of Taiji appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though the Taiji had been spinning backwards when the Taiji Sword was drawn,
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, it slowly moved in its original forward direction.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoooosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The snake’s body was slowly,
 </p>
 <p>
  And most assuredly, sucked into it.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that… the completed form of the Taiji Sword?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Above the split Tuseong, Seong Jihan, who had revived, looked up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash! Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  The snake’s body was covered with light several times but,
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike before when it could easily teleport, it could no longer move an inch.
 </p>
 <p>
  The snake’s body had been completely captured in the emblem formed by the void Taiji Sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I used it, but I’m not sure how I did it.‘
 </p>
 <p>
  Having inherited part of Dongbang Sak’s moves,
 </p>
 <p>
  When he briefly understood Ashoka’s enlightenment through the Golden Wheel,
 </p>
 <p>
  Instinctively, he had completed that single point of Taiji.
 </p>
 <p>
  To use it again, it seemed possible only during the timing of using the Golden Wheel.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I hope I won’t have to use it again.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, only one opportunity with the Golden Wheel remained.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had no desire to create more life-threatening situations.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking thus, Seong Jihan approached the snake when,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do… Dong. Bang. Sak…! To the very end, you…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  For the first time, the name of a warrior echoed from him who had lost his reason.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, Ashoka also helped with that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ashoka… He, that guy is the root of the problem…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Mentioning Ashoka’s name, the Martial God struggled even more.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator’s imposed madness seemed to have ended, and he was quite lucid.
 </p>
 <p>
  [If I had killed you back then on Tuseong… I wouldn’t have ended up like this…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right, but what’s the use of regretting now? You’re already finished.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Grrr… I, I can’t die like this… I tried to save myself…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Before he could finish his sentence,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoooosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Taiji spun faster and completely swallowed the snake’s head.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, only the rear part, the body, remained.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Finally dying.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Now I need to think about how I’ll escape from here.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan, with his arms crossed, was looking at the veil of light,
 </p>
 <p>
  [I can’t… die like this…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Another head suddenly popped out from the snake’s body.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  The head had definitely been sucked into the Taiji and disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Could it replicate like that?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… seriously persistent.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked incredulously at the head when,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Why, why can’t it detach?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The newly emerged snake’s head was panicked, unable to separate from its body.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you could have come out like that, you should’ve taken the teleportation offered by the White Administrator before. Oh, you were out of your mind then, so maybe you don’t remember?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Has the Taiji already taken control of me…?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, so hurry up and die.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […You wouldn’t save my life even if I begged, would you?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course not. Besides, even if I wanted to help, I couldn’t.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan said, pointing to the Taiji swallowing the snake.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t even know how to retract it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ah…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Realizing the truth in his words, the snake sighed,
 </p>
 <p>
  Sssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  And withdrew the head it had managed to extrude back into its body.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps realizing there was no escape,
 </p>
 <p>
  The body of the Martial God began to be sucked into the Taiji even faster.
 </p>
 <p>
  At this rate, the Martial God would disappear in less than 10 minutes.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Good. Die quickly and hand over the title of Martial God.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The title of ‘Martial God.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It held significant meaning for Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  To maximize the effects of his EX-grade skill, Infinite Annihilation God,
 </p>
 <p>
  Activating the title of ‘Martial God’ was necessary.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was looking forward to the completion of Infinite Annihilation God while watching the snake’s death,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash…!
 </p>
 <p>
  A bright white light sparkled behind him,
 </p>
 <p>
  Clap. Clap…
 </p>
 <p>
  The sound of clapping followed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Quite impressive, Blue Administrator. That beast was nearly powerful enough to reach the status of an Administrator… yet you subdued it so quickly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The voice was intense and commanding.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan immediately turned to look behind him,
 </p>
 <p>
  And first thing he saw was a large mouth and chin.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…What is this thing?’
 </p>
 <p>
  And below the chin.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead of a neck, there were two dangling arms on a grotesque creature that continued clapping.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why do all Administrators look like this? The Red one was all eyes, and now White is just a floating mouth.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I am not the White Administrator. How can I be compared to that perfect being?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then what are you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I am…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The clapping mouth stopped.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  It opened its lips, showing its teeth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each tooth was shimmering white.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Last Breed of the White.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Last Breed…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “And… the unconsciousness and instinct.”
 </p>
 <p>
  While saying that, he stopped clapping.
 </p>
 <p>
  “For humans, you might consider me the Id of that person.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Id?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Call me Idra.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  He says he’s the unconsciousness and instinct of the White, thus calling himself Idra.
 </p>
 <p>
  But isn’t that essentially just another part of the same thing?
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you’re the instinct of the White, then you’re ultimately part of the White. Why the wordplay?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No. That being is rational and sublime… certainly not someone who would aid a criminal like the Red Administrator.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pointing at his mouth with his finger,
 </p>
 <p>
  “It was only a ‘minor instinct’ like me that went against his noble intentions, investing a little.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So the ‘Great Sponsor’ of the Red is you, not the White? The White is innocent?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Precisely.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Clap. Clap.
 </p>
 <p>
  Idra started clapping again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan watched him, his gaze settling.
 </p>
 <p>
  “In the end, the White is just using you to shirk responsibility.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s not exactly true. It’s just that Idra is a bit deviant.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Playing nonsensical tricks.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan glared at him,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even this deviation of mine has helped you, hasn’t it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What help?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your regression.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Idra, mentioning ‘regression,’
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who do you think is responsible for it? Martial Saint Seong Jihan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Revealing his shining teeth, he smirked.

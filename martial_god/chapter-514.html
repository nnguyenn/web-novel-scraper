  Chapter 514
 </p>
 <p>
  “…You orchestrated my regression?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Martial Saint Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  The title mentioned by Idra was unmistakably what Seong Jihan had been called in his previous life.
 </p>
 <p>
  In that life, he remembered the moments just before his death.
 </p>
 <p>
  -It is fascinating.
 </p>
 <p>
  -NO.4212. Humanity was deemed a worthless species.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Resisting deletion.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just when he thought it was all over, a barrage of differently colored message windows suddenly appeared before him.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Let’s grant him an opportunity for a retry.
 </p>
 <p>
  -I agree.
 </p>
 <p>
  -I disagree. It’s a waste of power.
 </p>
 <p>
  -I agree.
 </p>
 <p>
  -I agree.
 </p>
 <p>
  With three votes in favor and one against, he was granted a ‘retry’ opportunity.
 </p>
 <p>
  After regressing from that point, the question of who had granted him this retry opportunity hung unresolved in his heart.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘After learning about the Infinite Regression of Martial God, I thought it might have been him… but it wasn’t.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Initially, the Martial God saw Seong Jihan as a manageable variable when acquiring Martial Soul.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, later on, realizing that his opponent was uncontrollable, he tried to kill him by any means.
 </p>
 <p>
  During these events, the Martial God didn’t mention the regression.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, he thought it wasn’t him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hence, seeing the message windows in various colors, he speculated whether the Administrators had intervened…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, I was the one who selected you as a variable in the Infinite Regression of Martial Gods.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Three in favor, one against. Was that whole show just you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No. Sending you back was not a simple task. The capability of the White Administrator was absolutely necessary. And for that, agreement within our circle was needed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “An agreement. So that was what the vote was about?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. I argued that you were necessary to safeguard the vessel, and the proposal was accepted.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…The vessel? Are you referring to the Great Vessel of the Void?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan furrowed his brows.
 </p>
 <p>
  Why was the ‘vessel’ suddenly being brought up here?
 </p>
 <p>
  At his question,
 </p>
 <p>
  Grinning,
 </p>
 <p>
  Idra’s smile broadened further.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, your niece was often killed early in the infinite cycles, by competitors.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But the competitor who killed her was not talented enough. Woefully inadequate for developing into an Administrator’s vessel.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought of Jin Yuhua from China at those words.
 </p>
 <p>
  She, who had been ordered to kill Yoon Seah to complete the Great Vessel of the Void Gift in her previous life, had ranked as the second-highest in the world but was woefully lacking in skills.
 </p>
 <p>
  Incompetent not only in combat but also inadequate for the role of the vessel.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, you regressed me for that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. I sent you back to the past to be her guardian.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Could have sent my brother-in-law too then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He didn’t resist deletion. Such individuals cannot be properly sent back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The ‘Deletion’ of Battlenet.
 </p>
 <p>
  From the moment he resisted it, he was chosen by Idra.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan steeled his gaze.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The completed Vessel…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as the Black Administrator had given the owner of the Arena the hat.
 </p>
 <p>
  This thing seemed far more valuable than he had thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  But,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wasn’t Gilgamesh there for the Red Vessel? Why bother…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He was the first Vessel server. And one Vessel… isn’t enough.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Vessel server…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right. Didn’t your case prove that Vessels was necessary?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Idra spread his hand,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ziing…
 </p>
 <p>
  The form of Earth materialized above his palm.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Humanity of Earth. They were originally destined to be the main server for the ‘HeavenNet’ that the Red Administrator intended to create. But your intervention with the Blue made that attempt fail.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Then Idra clenched and opened his fist again.
 </p>
 <p>
  The image of Earth disappeared, replaced by the figure of Gilgamesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thus, as the first vessel server, he was meant to operate the Hell instead. But since you’ve completely destroyed him, I’ve been informed by the Red.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  After the sign of Gilgamesh vanished from his palm, the next image that appeared was that of Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  “And the second vessel has already entered the domain of the Black. We cannot afford to confront that for now, making it difficult to lay hands on this server, too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, that’s good.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yet, there are still multiple ways to open Hell. The easiest is…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Idra, pointing at Seong Jihan,
 </p>
 <p>
  “To convince her.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ”…Convince? Are you suggesting I tell her to become a server?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No need to be so blunt. Just persuade her to take off the hat. Then, she can be converted into a server for HeavenNet instantly.”
 </p>

 <p>
  Seong Jihan blinked.
 </p>
 <p>
  No.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, this guy was telling him to backstab Yoon Seah?
 </p>
 <p>
  “…You really think I would agree to that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll share the rule of HeavenNet, or rather, the Hell based on it. The reward would be more than sufficient.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Get lost.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Faced with Seong Jihan’s reaction, Idra stroked his chin.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Was my explanation too complex? I’ll simplify it. Accept my proposal, and you’ll become the perpetual administrator of a new platform. Considering HeavenNet’s potential, you truly could become an immortal being.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just take off her hat. It’s simple. Now, let’s conduct the Light Contract.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a deal to become the perpetual administrator of HeavenNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  Convinced that Seong Jihan wouldn’t decline,
 </p>
 <p>
  Shiiiiik…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Idra wrote with letters made of white light in the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now, just sign here…”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Idra drew the underline for the signature,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  A black sword erupted from Seong Jihan’s hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  The contract, written in light, instantly split apart.
 </p>
 <p>
  Simultaneously, the written contract was buried in the void.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you doing?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you mean? I’m tearing up the contract.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Why?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Idra looked puzzled at Seong Jihan’s action and then,𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s nothing more to offer, Blue Administrator. Don’t be greedy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He frowned, apparently believing Seong Jihan’s refusal was due to insufficient compensation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even if you gave me HeavenNet itself, I would decline.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan’s sword ripped the contract again,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, was it because of Yoon Seah? Family. To give up being a perpetual administrator over a niece…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Idra, understanding as if it just dawned on him, stroked his chin.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Looks like I’ve been far too gentle in my persuasion…”
 </p>
 <p>
  His voice began to deepen.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, let’s proceed to the next step.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Clap!
 </p>
 <p>
  With a single clap from Idra,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Acknowledged, Sponsor.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The voice of the Red Administrator resounded from the void.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  Idra’s figure began to fade.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Whenever you change your mind, just let me know.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There won’t be such a time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “To aid your decision, I’ll keep you entertained.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ziing…
 </p>
 <p>
  As his words ended, an image appeared in the void,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Displaying the monument ‘Invitation from BattleNet.’
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, in Washington, USA.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the location of the monument ‘Invitation from BattleNet’,
 </p>
 <p>
  Drip. Drip.
 </p>
 <p>
  Reddish liquid dripped from the inscription.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What exactly is this phenomenon?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We, we don’t know…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s never been a case like this before.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, there wouldn’t have been.
 </p>
 <p>
  Who would have expected the inscription to drip bloody, foreboding red liquid like this?
 </p>
 <p>
  US government agents frowned, watching people from the BattleNet Association respond so nonchalantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Was that it? Witness such an anomaly and just say ‘I don’t know’?
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll tell you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  From inside the monument,
 </p>
 <p>
  Fluent English flowed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh, what…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the researchers showed signs of confusion,
 </p>
 <p>
  [I will lead you on the right path.]
 </p>
 <p>
  From the monument, a voice as courteous as ever spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  [BattleNet disconnection.]
 </p>
 <p>
  And as it declared disconnection,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  Most of the dispatched individuals’ faces turned ashen.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  One’s wrinkles deepened.
 </p>
 <p>
  Another’s hair visibly fell out.
 </p>
 <p>
  BattleNet disconnection.
 </p>
 <p>
  The power of that single phrase was beyond imagination.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What… what is this…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh my God…! My, my hair!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was clearly healthier after the health boost…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The people dispatched to the monument looked at their transformed appearances in despair, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  Their concerns were, in fact, luxury compared to others.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Oh, mother has collapsed again…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What, what’s happening? People are…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can’t get through to the hospital…”
 </p>
 <p>
  People who were once unconscious or could barely move, having overcome these with species evolution,
 </p>
 <p>
  Were now becoming ‘emergency patients’ again after the disconnection of BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  And.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh… what’s going on?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why do I feel like this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “My strength is back to before I became a player…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Status window! Status window! Why isn’t it appearing?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even players who once exhibited superhuman strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  The moment ‘BattleNet disconnection’ was triggered, they lost all their power in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  -What’s happening all of a sudden…
 </p>
 <p>
  -My friend was squatting 200 kg when suddenly his back went out… I called 119, but it’s emergency everywhere now…
 </p>
 <p>
  -News alerts are just pouring in.
 </p>
 <p>
  -“BattleNet disconnection.” Did I just hear that?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yeah… I heard it too.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But BattleTube is still working…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yeah, true;
 </p>
 <p>
  After the message of BattleNet disconnection displayed, the world underwent a complete transformation.
 </p>
 <p>
  The world had instantly reverted to a time before BattleNet existed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The only difference perhaps was the ability to access BattleTube.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Queen…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Do you know anything about this phenomenon?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ah, crazy. My skin just wrinkled. I have a blind date today.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is a blind date your concern right now? My mom can’t even stand up…
 </p>
 <p>
  The channel of the Shadow Queen was inundated with people.
 </p>
 <p>
  Confused by the current situation, they sought answers from her due to her extensive experience with BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  “BattleNet disconnection? Did something like that show up?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Shadow Queen blinked her eyes in response to the chat messages.
 </p>
 <p>
  But then repeated,
 </p>
 <p>
  “BattleNet disconnection? Did you see that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I didn’t get any message like that…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It seems it was specifically targeted at ‘humanity.’]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then why are you still stone?”
 </p>
 <p>
  […I left humanity when I became the Witch of the Void.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, I see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I’ll go check on Seah.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jiah responded to the Shadow Queen and left her place.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… A BattleNet disconnection applied all at once globally… Could this be related to Seong Jihan?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Shadow Queen watched the situation unfold, she speculated.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Seong Jihan…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ah, now that I think of it, he’s been saying that we should escape BattleNet…
 </p>
 <p>
  -No matter how urgent, leaving this suddenly is not okay…
 </p>
 <p>
  -We should’ve been given some time to prepare…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Used to be an advocate for escaping BattleNet, but I’ve changed my mind. The evolutionary benefits from BattleNet were tremendous…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yep, you really feel the difference when it’s gone;
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow, what’s happening!!
 </p>
 <p>
  As people recalled Seong Jihan’s previous advocacy for leaving BattleNet, they began to react explosively.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Ah, did I stir up something unnecessarily…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Simply mentioning Seong Jihan’s name had unleashed a torrent of public outcry.
 </p>
 <p>
  It felt like lighting a fuse.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Shadow Queen was contemplating how to manage the situation,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ziing…
 </p>
 <p>
  Beneath her channel screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  A red eye suddenly popped out.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Humanity, do you now understand? The value of what you’ve enjoyed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  No.
 </p>
 <p>
  The red eye wasn’t only on the Shadow Queen’s channel.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was appearing on every currently broadcasted BattleTube channel.
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you wish,]
 </p>
 <p>
  The instigator of BattleNet disconnection,
 </p>
 <p>
  [I can restore what you’ve lost.]
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, the instigator began to allure the confused masses.

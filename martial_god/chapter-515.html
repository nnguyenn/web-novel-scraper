  Chapter 515
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan stared at the display Idra had shown.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since the disconnection from BattleNet, humanity had been reduced to the lowest tier species.
 </p>
 <p>
  All the benefits enjoyed through species evolution were now revoked.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially for players, as their levels had been reset to zero, massive confusion ensued.
 </p>
 <p>
  The world was in extreme chaos, and the screen was split, showing only the most extreme situations.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Trapping me here, and pulling that stunt on Earth…’
 </p>
 <p>
  To think they deactivated the connection with a BattleNet invitation.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator was really good at everything except fighting.
 </p>
 <p>
  Speaking of which,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why is the Black doing nothing about this… open and outright maneuver?”
 </p>
 <p>
  On Seong Jihan’s questioning,
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you expect his help, you might need to rethink that.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Idra’s voice resonated from within the screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Given that humanity and BattleNet’s link have been severed, Black cannot interfere directly here.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Compared to you, Black really has a lot more restrictions.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Though, he does possess strength…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Between White and Black, it seemed Black would have the upper hand in a direct confrontation based on what he inferred from Idra’s words, plunging Seong Jihan into deep thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Having the top hat with Seah is better for now, but if we’re stuck here much longer, we’ll inevitably end up in a worse situation.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He had entered with the intent to finish off the Martial God and the Red Administrator, but with White Administrator’s intervention, he was truly tethered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan turned his gaze away from the screen and looked at the light barrier that completely sealed Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No matter how I look at it, that’s impenetrable.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Idra had said he was part of and also the instinct of the White, yet the power of a permanent administrator was evident.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The confusion is ultimately what you have caused. If only one sacrifices, everyone else could be happy… Do you not see the pained state of humanity?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm. No, I don’t see it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Idra was using humanity as an excuse to push a contract on him, but Seong Jihan ignored it completely.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead,
 </p>
 <p>
  “But it’s weird? Isn’t this situation going according to your plans? I don’t see why you keep pushing the contracts, even giving up your own share in this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan even questioned what Idra was thinking.
 </p>
 <p>
  [True. Though continuing this way, Hell will still be established. However, I am looking beyond that.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Beyond?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Red Administrator is not easy to control. He requires a check mechanism, someone like you who is diametrically opposed to him.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…So, you want to use me as his counterweight?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Exactly.]
 </p>
 <p>
  It was all about waiting for the right moment to backstab.
 </p>
 <p>
  Did becoming part of the administrators change them all like this?
 </p>
 <p>
  White, Red, Green—all utterly abnormal.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, but can’t we just work with Seah keeping her top hat on?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That cannot happen.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “So? There’s a reason why the hat must be taken off then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […….]
 </p>
 <p>
  Idra did not respond to Seong Jihan’s deduction, which essentially confirmed it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It seems they also have their reasons for needing Seah.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If he really had the advantage, he wouldn’t be pushing contracts to remove that accursed hat.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan steeled his gaze.
 </p>
 <p>
  He guessed it meant he had to go back to Earth after all.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is there no other variable here that could bolster my strength?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan dismissed the screen right before him and approached the snake being sucked into the Taiji.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hey, can’t you just hurry up and die already?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The snake, still not fully extinguished and clearly holding onto the title of ‘Martial God,’ responded to Seong Jihan’s urging.
 </p>
 <p>
  A portion of the snake’s body where nothing remained suddenly sprouted a head.
 </p>
 <p>
  […My death seems to amplify your power. Are you seeking the title of ‘Martial God’ then?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You catch on quick.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Contrary to your expectations, that title is merely a symbol of honor… if you expected power, you’ll be disappointed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the snake said this, its eyes flashed brightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  [There’s a better way…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Allow me to enter your body.]
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  “…You mean to parasitize me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan asked in disbelief.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. Just a small space will do. About the size of an insect… As long as it can contain my consciousness.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The snake boldly claimed its willingness to become a parasite.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  “Nevermind that…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you agree, I will transfer the ownership of all remaining relics to you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…How many are there?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I can transfer 51.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Was that all that remained of the numerous constellation relics after being destroyed?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Still, acquiring them would definitely enhance my power.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With no way to break through the barrier of light right now, the snake’s proposal was quite appealing.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, since this was the entity that even Dongbang Sak couldn’t escape the golden shackles from, it was too risky to casually accept its offer.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan continued to ponder in silence,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial God said in desperation,
 </p>
 <p>
  [No other conditions for the parasitism. Just let me bite you once.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just a bite?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. I’ll even transfer some of the relics beforehand.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Given that the main body continued to be absorbed into the Taiji, the Martial God, the once noble guardian, now offered to hand over the relics first.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright. Give me the relics first.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan nodded,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Wandering Martial God transfers ‘Relic of the Constellation #174’. Do you accept?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Wandering Martial God transfers ‘Relic of the Constellation #2217’. Do you accept?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Multiple message windows appeared before his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan pressed ‘Yes.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Ziiiiing…
 </p>
 <p>
  The floating fragments of the destroyed Constellation relics began to gravitate towards him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They were just floating around, broken.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s not the shape that matters, but the power contained within. There is still quite a significant amount of energy left… isn’t there?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed, the Constellation relics that the Martial God had passed on contained immense power.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before the transfer, no such power could be felt from the fragments.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed the power could truly be used only after the ownership was transferred.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This could definitely be used to amplify my strength.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the five Constellation relics linked to him by a red light, Seong Jihan appraised their power.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although continuously leaking energy due to being broken, they seemed useful for one-time use.
 </p>
 <p>
  [How about it?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Not bad.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Then, may I bite you?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The suddently protruding head from the snake’s torso distraughtly spoke, witnessing its body almost fully sucked into the Taiji.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a truly desperate situation, the end was near for it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet,
 </p>
 <p>
  “No.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […Why not?! You needed power, didn’t you?!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, I need power, but.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan handled the red light with his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I think I can make use of this without having to accept your transfer.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [What…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Like this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whooosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  From Seong Jihan’s body, the red light blazed forth, starting to connect to the remnants of the Constellation relics.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This, simply put, is a modification of the red’s capabilities.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The light linked to the Constellation’s relics.
 </p>
 <p>
  Being diametrically opposed by nature, Seong Jihan quickly discerned its properties.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Good that I left some stat red around.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Just in case, he had left some stat red around, which he now decided to use.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan made this connection, the Constellation relics shifted.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ah red… this too?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Hearing this, the snake let out an exasperated sigh.
 </p>
 <p>
  With this, the last means it had to negotiate was gone.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thanks, pal. I never thought there was still power in those remnants, but you gave a good hint.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […Is there truly no chance you might spare me?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course not.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssh. Ssh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan gestured towards the Taiji.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stop resisting. Now go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [No, wait… listen to me!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite having nothing left to negotiate, the Martial God struggled until the last moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shooosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The Taiji, rotating properly, sucked in the tail of the snake.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  [‘The Wandering Martial God’ has been extinguished.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have defeated the Martial God, thus inheriting the title ‘Martial God’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  System messages popped up for Seong Jihan indicating the extinction of the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  And following this,
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Martial God’ title equipped. Do you wish to activate it now?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Note – Once equipped, the title ‘Martial God’ cannot be removed.
 </p>
 <p>
  A warning message appeared due to the title’s single-slot occupancy.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Equip it right away.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon Seong Jihan’s command,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The title ‘Martial God’ is being equipped.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Skill ‘Infinite Annihilation God’ amplified.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The realization of ‘Martial Soul’ is enhanced.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Martial Soul of Dongbang Sak, which Infinite Annihilation God couldn’t fully contain, began to manifest more distinctly within Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…This.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked around.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the title ‘Martial God,’ his martial talent had evolved further.
 </p>
 <p>
  The world as perceived now, was conspicuously different from just moments before.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Was the world he saw really so different from mine…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even the Constellation relics, which he had felt no power from before their transfer, now revealed hidden energies just by sight.
 </p>
 <p>
  Up until a moment ago, the barrier of light seemed absolutely impenetrable,
 </p>
 <p>
  But now, he could spot several weak points in it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The barriers clogging both ends of the Galactic Sword Scar are clearly weaker.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Galactic Sword Scar had once completely bisected Tuseong,
 </p>
 <p>
  Its remnants were sealed by the barrier of light, but that sealing was far from perfect.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Good. I’ll break through there.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Whooooosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Red light emanated in all directions from Seong Jihan’s body,
 </p>
 <p>
  And the floating Constellation relics began to connect all at once.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Blue Administrator, you… are actually thinking of breaking through?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing this, Idra, who reappeared after turning off the screen, moved his lips busily.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Even as a temporary administrator, can’t you see the difference in strength? That isn’t ‘Idra’ but rather a barrier erected by the White Administrator himself. Only the Black Administrator can penetrate it.]
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed the barrier of light was indeed too robust because it was constructed with a permanent administrator’s full strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Certainly, if it wasnî’t for the parts touched by the Galactic Sword Scar, it might have been difficult to break through…
 </p>
 <p>
  The discrete power of a permanent administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  But now, with the ability to draw power from the Constellation relics,
 </p>
 <p>
  He could well penetrate that barrier.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Not just breaking through, but I need to return to Earth in one go.’
 </p>
 <p>
  To do so,
 </p>
 <p>
  He would need to employ the same method he used when he arrived here.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  Behind Seong Jihan, the Taiji emerged,
 </p>
 <p>
  And within it, the appearance of the Black Sword was revealed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Good. Give it a try. That should let you truly understand the disparity.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Idra, seemingly pleased by this development, watched on.
 </p>
 <p>
  He thought that once Seong Jihan felt despair against the wall erected by a permanent administrator, he would realize his place.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, initially though he watched Seong Jihan’s actions leisurely, he changed his tune once he saw the power contained in the Taiji Sword connected to the Constellation’s relics.
 </p>
 <p>
  […Indeed, you’re quite capable.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The energy contained within the Taiji Sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even for him, who knew the absolute power of light, it was quite threatening.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, despite this, Idra ultimately believed that the sword would not be able to penetrate the barrier.
 </p>
 <p>
  Until Seong Jihan’s flesh was sucked into the sword,
 </p>
 <p>
  He thought so.
 </p>
 <p>
  Infinite Annihilation God
 </p>
 <p>
  Heart Method
 </p>
 <p>
  Mind Creates All
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoooosh!𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan vanished.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sword, following the trajectory of the Galactic Sword Scar,
 </p>
 <p>
  Rushed towards the remnants of light.
 </p>
 <p>
  The dark sword, once it reached the barrier of light,
 </p>
 <p>
  [No…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Pierced it in one fell swoop.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, the barrier that enveloped Tuseong seemed to twinkle for a moment,
 </p>
 <p>
  Before gradually crumbling.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stop, stop…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Idra hurriedly sought the dark sword, but by then it had already disappeared.

  Chapter 516
 </p>
 <p>
  The sudden disconnection from BattleNet had consequences that escalated over time for all humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  -What happened… I just woke up to this chaos?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Where did my level go? I just made it to the gold league!!
 </p>
 <p>
  -This isn’t about levels; my father can’t think straight anymore… He just got discharged…
 </p>
 <p>
  -It feels so strange being back to the lowest-tier species…
 </p>
 <p>
  The people, reverted to the state of the lowest-tier species, immediately felt the deprivation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially in homes where severely ill family members had regained health and been discharged.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not everyone suffered relapses, but many were shocked to see old illnesses return.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  -We should never have left BattleNet…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Can’t live like before, really.
 </p>
 <p>
  -How do we even go back to how things were?
 </p>
 <p>
  Amidst this chaos, the only thing working as before was BattleTube.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  -Everything on the Shadow Queen’s channel isn’t turning off…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Are we supposed to gather here?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Was the Shadow Queen in on this?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Don’t know; things changed too quickly…
 </p>
 <p>
  With broadcasts on other channels shutting down, only the Shadow Queen’s channel was functioning correctly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We might have set a viewing record, but now we’ve caught the Red Administrator’s eyes,”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Shadow Queen, frowned at her channel frame.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud. Thud.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah and Seong Jiah approached her.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wouldn’t it be better to shut down the channel rather than let the Red Administrator use it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I would if I could, but it won’t turn off.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Really? Not just for the viewers?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seriously, it’s true. Right now, humanity is being treated as irrelevant on BattleTube. Even if a hundred billion people gather, they won’t give any GP.”
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wait, what happened to my GP!
 </p>
 <p>
  -Systems are down, think GP exists?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Aw, I exchanged a billion yesterday, such a loss…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Lost money and health…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wait, I used GP to pay back tuition fees to my parents; convert it to dollars already!
 </p>
 <p>
  As GP also vanished with BattleNet’s disconnection, panic ensued since so much was lost in such a brief moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  Amid this, a red eye unexpectedly appeared beneath the Shadow Queen’s channel.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Humanity, do you wish to regain what you’ve lost?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Spoken in a gentle tone by the Red Administrator, the camera then zoomed in on Yoon Seah approaching.
 </p>
 <p>
  [For that, she is needed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why are you zooming in on me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Next to her, a starfish suddenly appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Red Administrator, what are you doing right now?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Isn’t it obvious, Messenger of the Void.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [I have already reported this incident to the Black Administrator. He will not ignore this.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Heh…]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator only laughed at the mention of the Black Administrator intervening soon.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Earth and humanity no longer belong to BattleNet’s world. The Void cannot intervene immediately.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [But if you intervened to cause this problem, it’s different. We have the authority to intervene during emergencies.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Is that so? Why haven’t you come then?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The starfish, the Messenger, kept silent for a moment before continuing.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Communication has been severed… Could it be that the White Administrator is also involved in this?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Who knows, I’m not sure.]
 </p>
 <p>
  […That explains it. There’s a reason behind what you’ve been doing.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  As the starfish enlarged, blocking Yoon Seah’s path, the Red Administrator spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  [There’s no need to block her. I have no intention of touching her directly unless she takes off the hat herself.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why would I take this off?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, touching her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ziiiiing…
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, many screens appeared before her, showing people in turmoil after suddenly becoming the lowest tier, collapsing, vomiting blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Emergency lines aren’t responding, now I see why…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ah, isn’t that Oliver from America? Why did he kill himself?
 </p>
 <p>
  -He wasn’t committing suicide, he was flying with magic and fell.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow, such a big accident…
 </p>
 <p>
  Among various emergency outbursts, many were caused by players overestimating their abilities.
 </p>
 <p>
  In these screens, the Red Administrator then said,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Seeing people like this, do you intend to remain the owner of the arena?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You did this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You can help them.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “On what grounds?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah’s firm response was met with laughter from the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Heh… I see. So this is your answer. Humanity, one person’s sacrifice would have restored prosperity to six billion.]
 </p>
 <p>
  -Who would listen to his words…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Didn’t the Red Administrator cause this mess?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Maybe cooperating was better given the circumstances.

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  -?? How can you trust him and ask Yoon Seah to sacrifice?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Maybe…
 </p>
 <p>
  As opinions diverged while people watched Yoon Seah refuse,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  Below the channel screen, a big red eye flashed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Still, I will offer you an opportunity.]
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Eyes popped out from the screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow, spooky, the eyes actually popped out!
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ugh, so gross.
 </p>
 <p>
  -I almost touched it
 </p>
 <p>
  -I already touched it, what do I do?
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  Initially frightened by the actual red eyes protruding from below the screen,
 </p>
 <p>
  [One hundred million.]
 </p>
 <p>
  At the Red Administrator’s voice,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The first hundred million humans to touch these eyes will regain what they once enjoyed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  people quickly succumbed.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wait, what… this is nonsense!
 </p>
 <p>
  -Who would press this?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yuck, so gross!
 </p>
 <p>
  -People, don’t press this!
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite screams from the Shadow Queen’s chat not to press the eyes,
 </p>
 <p>
  Sssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  A count appeared beside the eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the count began counting down rapidly.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Already over a million.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Subsequently, a new screen showed those who had collapsed rising up and players regaining their abilities.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Oh… it worked. Status window. Two status windows are back…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren’s face, previously pale, lit up in a moment as he opened two status windows.
 </p>
 <p>
  -…Seems to really work.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Look at Baron’s face. it’s much better;
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ah, I had more than a billion GP… Screw it, I’m pressing!
 </p>
 <p>
  -Hey, I pressed it and everything is back to normal!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the count increased geometrically,
 </p>
 <p>
  One million became ten million.
 </p>
 <p>
  And ten million soon reached thirty million,
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why are they doing this? How can you trust the Red?
 </p>
 <p>
  -People are dying; what choice do we have?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Those who changed all their assets into GP have no choice but…
 </p>
 <p>
  -I touched the eye for my collapsing father and he returned to normal…
 </p>
 <p>
  People were becoming increasingly agitated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although it was evident the Red Administrator caused this issue, and his proposal was suspicious enough even for a child to notice,
 </p>
 <p>
  For those in urgent situations, even a rotten rope must be grasped.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, as the count rapidly reached a hundred million,
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s done.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  The protruding red eyes retracted back into the screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ah, I haven’t pressed it yet…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Got distracted and missed the chance again…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Will there be another chance?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why would anyone press it, you fools?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Just wait till Seong Jihan returns…
 </p>
 <p>
  Amid a frenzied chat, people either begged for another chance or questioned the sanity of those who pressed.
 </p>
 <p>
  With many seeing effects, public opinion was split.
 </p>
 <p>
  To think the Red Administrator caused all this… People quickly sided with him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah observed the public opinion shift with a cold gaze.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You pressed well.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator’s eyes suddenly protruded before Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Vessel, have you still not changed your mind?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What, cooperate with you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah simply raised her hand, channeling the energy of the Void without responding further.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instantly, a purple arrow formed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the arrow flew, piercing through the red eye,
 </p>
 <p>
  [I heard your answer… Then, I shall create a new vessel.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Roar!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the pierced eye vanished,
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, the sky turned blood red.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Look outside…”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Yoon Seah and her party looked out the living room window,
 </p>
 <p>
  Faces with red eyes watched her through the glass, now quickly transforming into the form of a giant Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  The giant’s face grew until it reached the rooftop of the Sword Palace.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This building… was also home to the Blue Administrator.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [He gave me quite some trouble, so I’ll transform this building into my new vessel.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Transforming the Sword Palace into a vessel?
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah watched as the giant Red Administrator reached towards the building, attempting to resist with Void Arrows, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Such efforts cannot counter the power donated by a hundred million.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom! Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  Void Arrows exploded in midair without reaching the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  And as his hand touched Sword Palace,
 </p>
 <p>
  The windows and the building rapidly turned red.
 </p>
 <p>
  -A hundred million donated power…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Didn’t I say not to press it… His power just increased.
 </p>
 <p>
  -People are dying, what can we do…?
 </p>
 <p>
  -It’s all over now; Seong Jihan is nowhere, and communication is cut… Better to align with the new trend.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Really, what is Seong Jihan doing…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Went to hunt the Martial God but lost our base.
 </p>
 <p>
  As such, even though it turned out that pressing the eye had amplified the Red Administrator’s power, people felt they had no choice.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some even blamed Seong Jihan, and Yoon Seah’s expression hardened.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Fulfilling the Hell after dyeing the Blue’s stronghold red… Haven’t been this pleased in a long time.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Where is my uncle?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Curious?]
 </p>
 <p>
  As Yoon Seah asked,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ziiiiing…
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator kindly provided a screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  It first showed Tuseong split in half by the Galactic Sword Scar.
 </p>
 <p>
  [He may have split Tuseong, but he is trapped inside.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the screen zoomed in, an unconscious Seong Jihan appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  The light barrier that had trapped him did not appear on the screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your administrator will now be sealed. Abandon your regrets and welcome a new ruler. Here’s your last chance.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  With those words, the red eye popped out again.
 </p>
 <p>
  The count, which had collected a hundred million,
 </p>
 <p>
  Now aimed for two hundred million.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ah, Seong Jihan is really trapped…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Doesn’t look too dangerous from the outside.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But if he already handled the Martial God, why hasn’t he returned? Is he indeed trapped?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ah, but the count has increased to two hundred million… Should we really press this?
 </p>
 <p>
  -I think since we can see Seong Jihan is alive, maybe we shouldn’t push it further.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Should hold on a bit longer…
 </p>
 <p>
  -But we’re already at a hundred and twenty million…
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeming to sense it was futile, twenty million more were quickly added to the tally.
 </p>
 <p>
  At this rate, two hundred million would be reached in no time.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I don’t understand why he can’t come out… Surely, the Martial God has vanished.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the messenger said this, watching the screen,
 </p>
 <p>
  Sssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  Behind Seong Jihan, the Taiji emerged and his body was sucked into the sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hmm, unnecessary efforts…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching this, the Red Administrator could only scoff.
 </p>
 <p>
  Roar!
 </p>
 <p>
  But as the dark sword pierced the void,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, out of the apparently dark void on the screen,
 </p>
 <p>
  A barrier of light was revealed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [What, this is… the barrier of light!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s the absolute power of the White Administrator. He tried to seal the Blue Administrator with it. This actually proves that White was involved in this matter!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle. Crackle.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the messenger excitedly jabbered, touching the screen,
 </p>
 <p>
  [No! How can this be pierced…]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator, uncharacteristically flustered, hurriedly shut off the screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had intended to show Seong Jihan imprisoned in Tuseong,
 </p>
 <p>
  But had inadvertently broadcast his escape live.
 </p>
 <p>
  [If this is how it’s going to be, I must make an effort…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Roar…
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing Seong Jihan’s escape, the flame-rising Red Administrator attempted to transform the building into a vessel for the Hell,
 </p>
 <p>
  Chzzzt!
 </p>
 <p>
  But before he could proceed,
 </p>
 <p>
  His head and torso were vertically split.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This…]
 </p>
 <p>
  The voice of the Red Administrator broke as he spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  His eyes rolled downward,
 </p>
 <p>
  And there,
 </p>
 <p>
  On the road as seen in the screen, the black Taiji Sword was stuck as if it had been there the whole time.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m a bit late.”
 </p>
 <p>
  From the sword, Seong Jihan emerged.

  Chapter 517
 </p>
 <p>
  In Tuseong, the Red Administrator entrapped Seong Jihan with the veil of light.
 </p>
 <p>
  The simplicity of the plan was matched only by its effectiveness since the Veil itself was a powerful decree of the White Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was believed to be impenetrable by a mere temporary administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed, upon first sight of the Veil, Seong Jihan himself doubted it could be conquered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Crossing this Veil… Unbelievable.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator could scarcely accept the unfolding reality.
 </p>
 <p>
  That a temporary administrator, someone like Seong Jihan, could penetrate a permanent administrator’s power was beyond his comprehension.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead of answering the Red Administrator’s doubts, Seong Jihan simply,
 </p>
 <p>
  Click.
 </p>
 <p>
  Effortlessly drew his sword from the road.
 </p>
 <p>
  Infinite Annihilation God
 </p>
 <p>
  Triad of Martial Mastery:
 </p>
 <p>
  Mount Tai Suppression
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Szzzz…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The body of the Red Administrator,
 </p>
 <p>
  which was split once already,
 </p>
 <p>
  cleaved in two yet again from a light swing of the blade.
 </p>
 <p>
  The swing started from the ground and reached the heavens, drawing a straight blue line.
 </p>
 <p>
  And,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Fighting is not viable, it seems.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the face split in two, the eyes of the Red Administrator flashed independently.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though he had always admitted to his shortcomings in combat, this one swing made him swiftly understand the difference between himself and Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had anticipated a gap after severing the Veil of Light, but facing it confirmed his disadvantage.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Fighting the Blue Administrator would be a certain defeat.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He acknowledged his inferiority in combat compared to the blue, forcing him to seek alternate methods since the Blue Administrator was giving no quarter.
 </p>
 <p>
  Szzzzk…!
 </p>
 <p>
  As blue light shimmered along the dark blade’s edge, the gargantuan body of the Red Administrator split into thousands of threads.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You offer no resistance.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon Seong Jihan’s observation,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whhhhlll… The shattered body of the giant reignited and regenerated itself.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Combat was never my domain to begin with.”𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  “For something not in your area, you regenerate quite persistently.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s premature to give up when the vessel’s completion is this close.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The vessel … you mean the blood-drenched Sword Palace?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan glanced briefly at the building the Red Administrator had touched.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not only had the building changed color, but it was also absorbing massive power from outside, which had also been used for the recent regeneration.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s what’s keeping you alive.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. As long as the support of 120 million continues, I will keep reviving.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “120 million?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The number of humans who have chosen to follow me. Even after your return, it continues to grow.”
 </p>
 <p>
  While trapped in Tuseong, the Red Administrator had been busy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan watched him closely,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘As long as there’s a spark left, it uses that to survive.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if you sliced the opponent into thousands of pieces, as long as it doesn’t fully extinguish, the Red Administrator could use the Sword Palace to regenerate again.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you’re going to eliminate him, it must be done in one strike, without giving him a chance to regenerate.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Then.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan planted his sword into the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment, the dark sword fully bathed in blue glow.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ground momentarily marked with the Taiji.
 </p>
 <p>
  He then drew his sword and sliced upwards towards the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  Infinite Annihilation God
 </p>
 <p>
  Taiji Sword
 </p>
 <p>
  Blue Light Sword
 </p>
 <p>
  From the earth to the sky, a streak of blue light aligned straight. It appeared almost the same as when he had used Mount Tai Suppression previously.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That sword again? No matter how many times you slice, it’s futile…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even as the Red Administrator was split in mid-sentence, he continued speaking calmly, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  The blue streak from the slashed sword did not disappear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm? This is…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the sword light flashed, the flesh of the Red Administrator was wholly sucked into it.
 </p>
 <p>
  The trace of the sword absorbed both the red embers and the red light that had infiltrated the building.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that Dongbang Sak’s sword? To think that you could wield this…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s merely an imitation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Heh, to think everything was nearly accomplished…”
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  As the original color returned to the building and the Red Administrator’s body was sucked into the sword trace before he could regenerate, he let out a resigned breath.
 </p>
 <p>
  “To die like this, how anticlimactic. Building the Hell was an impossible dream…”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Red Administrator was sucked into the sword trace, uttering his last words, Seong Jihan smirked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Trickery? Acting dead now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Did you notice?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Make your last words when I destroy the HeavenNet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You figured that much? You really are relentless.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Relentless? That word suits you better.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huffhuff…”
 </p>
 <p>
  As his laughter faded, the Red trace also vanished into the sword trace.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan then promptly jumped, landing inside the penthouse window.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jihan, how’s your body? Are you alright?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan arrived at the window, his relatives approached with concern in their expressions.
 </p>
 <p>
  He gave them a light smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Luckily, you all seem fine.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Then his gaze shifted to the floating messenger beside Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, what’s the Black Administrator doing? White is openly collaborating with the Red Administrator to trap me, and he’s just watching?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve already made a report, but until now, communications were blocked by White’s jurisdiction over BattleNet. However, communications are now restored, and the report has reached him.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Communications are open now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes… by then this crisis was declared a ‘partial deviation’.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A partial deviation?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s brows furrowed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Idra had been put forward to serve as a scapegoat when needed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can ‘partial’ move the Veil of light?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s why it wasn’t fully effective, and thus easily breached…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, this kind of response means the White Administrator won’t intervene in killing the Red Administrator?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. I have been assured of that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  While absurd to witness the White Administrator ducking responsibility in this chaos, it actually favored Seong Jihan’s approach.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘First, I’ll thoroughly eradicate one of them.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided then to start by uprooting the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  He looked at Yoon Seah,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll dispel the Red Administrator and come back. Just keep wearing the hat until then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle, are you going right now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. If we give him time, who knows what he’ll do next.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator, adept in everything but combat, could engage in further mischief if given the chance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now was the moment to root him out once and for all.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…You’ll be back soon, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah cautiously asked.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan smirked and responded,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course.”
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  In a space filled with light.
 </p>
 <p>
  There, a small flame flickered to life, revealing the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Great sponsor, now more than ever, your support is necessary.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Why did you needlessly focus on Tuseong? Because of that, the Veil of Light’s form was exposed. Now that it’s revealed, further intervention is impossible.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How could I have known it would be breached? The Blue Administrator is only temporary, and the Veil of Light was a powerful decree of a permanent administrator.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Regardless, ‘Idra’ can no longer come forward.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Hearing this, the Red Administrator smirked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why not intervene directly, aside from ‘Idra’?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That… cannot be done.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Because of the Black Administrator?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not yet the time for Black and White to contend.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The great sponsor was showing fear.
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator, recognizing the true intent from White’s reaction, grasped the real sentiments in a flash.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ultimately, you’re saying direct support is impossible.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…That’s correct.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Fine. Then, transfer the ownership of HeavenNet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That…”
 </p>
 <p>
  HeavenNet, named as a platform to replace BattleNet through the Hell, though yet without a tangible outcome,
 </p>
 <p>
  The White Administrator hesitated to respond, valuing something about this request.
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t we also need to erase all evidence that you were involved? If I survive, I’ll return the ownership to you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, I understand.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When the Red Administrator even promised to transfer the ownership back,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Only then did he transfer the rights.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a white light inscribed itself on the forehead of the red giant, he smiled, satisfied.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  ‘I’ve acquired a last resort to use.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even with ownership of HeavenNet from White, he stood no chance against the Blue Administrator, transformed now into a monster following his ordeal in Tuseong.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But, there’s no need to win through combat…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Nevertheless,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator had a plan.
 </p>
 <p>
  To resist the Blue Administrator, now the Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Washington, USA.
 </p>
 <p>
  The location of BattleNet’s invitation was already enveloped in massive flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even with efforts to quench it, the fire could not be extinguished.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once it was revealed that the Red Administrator was responsible,
 </p>
 <p>
  Including the White House, the majority of Washington’s citizens evacuated, leaving the city nearly empty.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the central part of this inferno, where a monument stood,
 </p>
 <p>
  Pfft…!
 </p>
 <p>
  A dark sword was plunged, and Seong Jihan appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s chaos here too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan casually drew his sword and,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Swiped it through the air a few times.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  The flames that had enveloped the city began to extinguish rapidly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The fire here was so weak that it could be extinguished without even using the sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So far, it’s nothing major.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With ten swings of his sword, Seong Jihan managed to contain most of the blazing fire in Washington.
 </p>
 <p>
  After casually ending the conflagration, what caught his eye were:
 </p>
 <p>
  The monument that had turned red, the invitation from BattleNet, and,
 </p>
 <p>
  A large red portal hanging above it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That portal… it’s like the Sword Palace, serving as a vessel.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A portal large enough for hundreds of people to enter at once.
 </p>
 <p>
  From all directions, unspecified energies were gathering towards its interior.
 </p>
 <p>
  This seemed similar to the 120 million mentioned earlier.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan observed the invitation and portal,
 </p>
 <p>
  “You have arrived quite quickly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  From within the red portal, the voice of the Red Administrator was heard.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ve found some leisure time, I see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I just finished preparing to receive guests.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  From within the red portal, a hand of the Red Administrator stretched out.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why don’t you come in?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is there a need to go in?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The portal, manipulated by the Red Administrator, was suspicious, and there was no need to enter it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just like before, I’ll slice through it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan planted his sword into the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Taiji symbol briefly imprinted on the earth,
 </p>
 <p>
  And a blade of blue light blossomed forth.
 </p>
 <p>
  From within the portal, the Red Administrator laughed,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Haha…whole portal you’re trying to slice through. That’s so like you. But are you also planning to kill those 120 million?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “120 million?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Exactly 125.14 million, to be precise. The number of humanity that has chosen to become subordinate to me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Hearing this, Seong Jihan furrowed his brows.
 </p>
 <p>
  That guy, indeed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not dying alone, he was dragging all the kids along.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Looking at the flow of energy, it doesn’t seem like a lie.’
 </p>
 <p>
  His gaze darkened.
 </p>
 <p>
  The slice of humanity that chose the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  To save them, should he risk entering the portal?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…That can’t happen.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If things went wrong,
 </p>
 <p>
  In trying to save 120 million, all of humanity might fall into the Red Administrator’s clutches.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  To just slice through it all, 120 million was indeed a large number.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is there another way?’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan pondered this for a moment, his gaze slowly shifted down towards,
 </p>
 <p>
  The invitation from BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  The very cause that sparked this chaos by withdrawing humanity from BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Alright.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was worth a try.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  Behind Seong Jihan, a golden wheel emerged.

  Chapter 518
 </p>
 <p>
  The Golden Wheel.
 </p>
 <p>
  This golden wheel, capable of reverting Seong Jihan to his state from 24 hours earlier, functioned in a way that was completely enigmatic, its mechanism a mystery.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  “With more understanding, it now seems possible to apply it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan brought the Golden Wheel close to the ‘Invitation from BattleNet.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Rrrrrrr…
 </p>
 <p>
  The golden wheel gradually began to move in reverse.
 </p>
 <p>
  Along with it, the characters that had been dyed red,
 </p>
 <p>
  Began to regain their original color.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Using that ability… on the invitation?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Then humanity will belong to BattleNet again. Wouldn’t it be better to forgo the 120 million and free them from BattleNet instead?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I need to prepare them before leaving. Otherwise, it’ll be a disaster, didn’t you demonstrate that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Since BattleNet had become intrinsically linked with human society,
 </p>
 <p>
  Preparation was necessary before departure.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, for now,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Back to it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Rrkk. Rrrrrrr…
 </p>
 <p>
  The golden wheel moved, and,
 </p>
 <p>
  The letters on the invitation rapidly returned to their original color.
 </p>
 <p>
  And,
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh… my body suddenly feels much healthier.
 </p>
 <p>
  -The status window is back!
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ah, the GP is exactly the same
 </p>
 <p>
  -I was really scared… It’s all reverted back to the original. It seems Seong Jihan did something.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wouldn’t the people who didn’t press the eye be the real winners?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow, those without faith, tsk tsk.
 </p>
 <p>
  The world began to rapidly revert to the era when it belonged to BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  [System Error Detected.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Repair work underway.]
 </p>
 <p>
  And for those who had pressed the red eye,
 </p>
 <p>
  A message announcing an error along with simultaneous repairs were conducted.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon after, the power of the red portal weakened significantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It seems the connection of that hundred million will thus be disconnected.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Although it was regrettable to use up the last Golden Wheel,
 </p>
 <p>
  If it completely eliminated the Red Administrator, it was worth it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now then,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Just removing that portal should end it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, feeling the cessation of external energies, picked up his sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s thwarted too…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Though the voice of the Red Administrator still emanated from the portal.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Enough talk, go now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Infinite Annihilation God
 </p>
 <p>
  Taiji Sword
 </p>
 <p>
  Blue Light Sword
 </p>
 <p>
  Paah!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan didn’t allow him to finish speaking before he split the portal in two.
 </p>
 <p>
  A stretch of blue sword light soared to the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  The strike exhibited an overwhelming adversary’s power for the portal.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if the portal would eventually be consumed by that force,𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Can’t leave even a piece of residue.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan vigilantly ensured nothing escaped from there.
 </p>
 <p>
  Leaving any leftovers would result in potential future troubles.
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, he had to completely extinguish even the smallest ember.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan stood fully prepared,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  The bisected portal revealed a face.
 </p>
 <p>
  The face of the red giant.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  [There’s no escaping this…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Blue, you have won.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking at the half-face speaking one piece after another,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What’s he up to now?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan swung his sword, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  [A reward is necessary for the winner.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [To the Blue Administrator, I transfer the ownership of ‘HeavenNet’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The ‘transfer’ from the Red Administrator was hastier.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do you accept the transfer of ownership of ‘HeavenNet’?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Then a message popped up before Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  He almost refused, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Should you refuse, ownership of HeavenNet will automatically transfer to the White Administrator.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon seeing the message that ownership would automatically pass to the White Administrator, Seong Jihan hesitated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike the Red, the White Administrator still boasted formidable power.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it went to him, it might lead to troublesome consequences.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Better to take it into my own hands.’
 </p>
 <p>
  So deciding that, he pressed ‘accept’.
 </p>
 <p>
  [HeavenNet service starts.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Player ‘Seong Jihan’ steps up as the permanent administrator of HeavenNet.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Existing systems will transfer to the new system……]
 </p>
 <p>
  [……]
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash. Flash.
 </p>
 <p>
  Innumerable message windows popped up and disappeared before Seong Jihan,
 </p>
 <p>
  And centered on his feet, a bright white light spread out.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The space had become completely isolated from the original world.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You are now connected to HeavenNet.]
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha. This guy really doesn’t die easily.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Stepping into HeavenNet, Seong Jihan frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator.
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Truly a nuisance until the very end.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The surrounding landscape… more hellish than heavenly.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite its name, HeavenNet’s vista was closer to an inferno.
 </p>
 <p>
  With both the land and sky flickering in nothing but bright, searing flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Might as well just destroy it immediately.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as Seong Jihan, who was literally grinding his teeth, began to gather his power while observing the scenery,
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have been inaugurated as the permanent administrator of HeavenNet.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Administrator privileges have been granted.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your level adjusts to the permanent administrator’s standards, rising to 9999.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A system message with a red background quickly rose.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…9999?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Normally administrators shouldn’t have a level entry.
 </p>
 <p>
  What was with 9999?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan opened his character window.
 </p>
 <p>
  Name: Seong Jihan
 </p>
 <p>
  Level: 9999
 </p>
 <p>
  Red: 100
 </p>
 <p>
  Blue: 999 (Will increase by +731 at SSS level)
 </p>
 <p>
  Void (Inactive)
 </p>
 <p>
  Eternity (Inactive)
 </p>
 <p>
  Remaining Points: 9999
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Quite a few changes.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With a character window filled with 999s, and both Void and Eternity inactivated,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at his left hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Taiji Sword, which he had created using the Void, had extinguished since entering HeavenNet,
 </p>
 <p>
  Only blue sword energy flickered forth now.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Could I upgrade the points I have left solely in Red and Blue? I should first try raising the Blue since it clearly belongs to my abilities.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The thought of upgrading Red was a bit discomforting, but since Blue definitely was his skill,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan attempted to invest his remaining points in Blue, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  [HeavenNet’s remaining points cannot raise the Blue.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A message appeared saying that the Blue cannot be raised.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So, I can only raise the Red?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Now that it had come to this, he felt even more reluctant to raise Red.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to let go of his attachment to the remaining points and picked up his sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though the Taiji Sword had vanished with the sealing of the Void,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s make use of the Blue instead.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Ziiiiiing…
 </p>
 <p>
  Blue light shimmered, and a sword of light formed in Seong Jihan’s hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  He extended the sword once,
 </p>
 <p>
  Suuuuurrr…
 </p>
 <p>
  Some flames were quenched, revealing places previously hidden by fire.
 </p>
 <p>
  What appeared were characters used by the Blood Clan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though Seong Jihan could read them, they contained significantly complex information.
 </p>
 <p>
  [HeavenNet Blueprints]
 </p>
 <p>
  Written there were the blueprints for HeavenNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  One would normally not understand what these blueprints meant just by reading,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Oddly enough, I understand this at a glance.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps because he had become a permanent administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as Seong Jihan saw the blueprints of HeavenNet, he instinctively understood them.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Eventually, the usage of HeavenNet means, rule like a god using Red.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The resources expended here for reigning as a permanent administrator were Red stats.
 </p>
 <p>
  This not only included the given remaining 9999 points but also the flames continually arising here, and even those in the ‘Hell.’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘How should I effectively eliminate this…’
 </p>
 <p>
  After swinging his sword a few times, Seong Jihan realized.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even with Blue stats at the SS level, he couldn’t eliminate this world.
 </p>
 <p>
  There must be a better way than just swinging the sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan paused to think for a moment, then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “System, is the Red Administrator here by any chance?”
 </p>
 <p>
  He asked HeavenNet’s system.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The previous owner, ‘Red Administrator’, sacrificed himself in Hell. Currently, he is being used as a source of energy for HeavenNet.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so? I was wondering how this place was maintained after cutting the connection with humanity.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The 120 million humanity following the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though he had severed their energy supply, it seemed HeavenNet continued to function.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator had even thrown himself into Hell.
 </p>
 <p>
  What a stubborn guy.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You can summon his fragments. Do you wish to proceed?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Summon him.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You will need 50 in the Red stat.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwaaarrrr…
 </p>
 <p>
  Flames flashed before his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  There, burning fiercely, were the scorched red eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Why have you summoned me?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator, even while being used as an energy source in Hell, still seemed nonchalant.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan spoke to him,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was seeking advice.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [From me…?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yep. Related to destroying HeavenNet. You designed it, so who better to know how?”
 </p>
 <p>
  […And you’re asking me for that?]
 </p>
 <p>
  While the Red Administrator was confused,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan asked the system.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How much Red is needed to make sure he speaks only the truth?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Each question requires 100 in the Red stat.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just 100?”
 </p>
 <p>
  It took 50 to summon his eyes, and now 100 per question.
 </p>
 <p>
  It looked like he would have to use the remaining points then.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan opened his character window and used 50 of the remaining points.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwaaarrrr…
 </p>
 <p>
  Flames burst from all around.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You receive support from Hell.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your Red stat grows threefold.]
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  His Red stat rose by 150 to 200.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather than his swiftly grown powers,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This… feels no joke.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The sensation he felt from raising the Red stat was impressively pleasant.
 </p>
 <p>
  It felt addictively pleasant, more than anything else.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey. Why does it feel like this when I raise the Red? Designer, answer me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon Seong Jihan’s question, 100 of his Red stat disappeared, and,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator spoke the truth.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Here, every time the Red goes up, it becomes integrated with HeavenNet. The sensation of unification with the server is more intense than any pleasure. But… you seem alright.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Actually, it was quite intense. I almost raised it more.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I was hoping you would.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why did you give me HeavenNet?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [If the Blue Administrator becomes the master of HeavenNet, this world will become complete. If you belong here, even the antithetical Blue can be absorbed, making it a grand achievement for the designer.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “So you sacrificed yourself just for that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Indeed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator answered immediately.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if he died, if HeavenNet’s completeness increased, that was enough for him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan could see just how obsessed the opponent was with this place.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thinking of asking you how to destroy HeavenNet actually amuses me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […Do you think I’ll give you a proper answer?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, I’ve run out of Red.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, realizing his resistance, noticed he had depleted his Red stat.
 </p>
 <p>
  He pressed to allocate remaining points, and the Red Administrator spoke,
 </p>
 <p>
  [This world is my life’s work. To tell you how to destroy it from my own mouth… Figure it out yourself!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You have the expertise here, first I need to hear what you have to say. Now. Speak quickly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In the world he created, the permanent administrator’s orders could not be defied.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The fastest way is to raise the Red to 9999 and command its destruction.]
 </p>
 <p>
  To raise the Red to 9999.
 </p>
 <p>
  That seemed risky for himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s change the question. How can I eliminate this world without any side effects to myself?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Without side effects… that will take a considerable amount of time.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t care. Safety first.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […]
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s inquiry, the Red Administrator glared fiercely.
 </p>
 <p>
  But as merely a fragment, he could not overcome the permanent administrator’s authority.
 </p>
 <p>
  [To reduce the domain of HeavenNet, lower the level of the permanent administrator.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Lower the level?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator, his scorched eyes bloodshot, provided that method.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How low?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [At least it has to drop to three digits.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm. From 9999 to three digits…”
 </p>
 <p>
  That was the way to safely eliminate HeavenNet?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan squinted but,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright. Let’s try that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Decided to follow the designer’s advice.
 </p>
 <p>
  After all, his level was 9999.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just lower it and if the domain didn’t shrink, seek another method.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, the process of downgrading levels began.
 </p>
 <p>
  It took longer than expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  [The level drops to 2.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…So it’s come to this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  While the Red Administrator did say the level had to reach three digits for destruction,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘HeavenNet, you’re more tenacious than I thought.‘
 </p>
 <p>
  The level had to drop to a single digit.
 </p>
 <p>
  And that was down to 2, before a solution emerged.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan surveyed his surroundings.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike before, no flames were seen in the pitch-dark space.
 </p>
 <p>
  The only thing casting light here
 </p>
 <p>
  Was a red sphere floating before his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The domain of HeavenNet… it won’t shrink further from here.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if the level dropped to 1, the reduction of the domain would not progress further.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now it was time to end this.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  Blue mist swirled around Seong Jihan’s left hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  From there, a blue light formed a sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  The red sphere was immediately pierced.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  As HeavenNet crumbled, red light began to spread in all directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although he hoped it would disappear with a single thrust, the resistant HeavenNet…
 </p>
 <p>
  As the light spread, if even a fragment was left, it would be troublesome.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘In that case…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s eyes twinkled.
 </p>
 <p>
  Infinite Annihilation God
 </p>
 <p>
  Suppress Fire, Seal Hell
 </p>
 <p>
  Blue-Red
 </p>
 <p>
  From within the blue sword, Red energy manifested.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the red sphere’s light began to be sucked into the sword,
 </p>
 <p>
  Shuuuuuu…
 </p>
 <p>
  The blue sword, storing the strength of HeavenNet inwardly,
 </p>
 <p>
  The exterior’s blue and the interior’s red stood out starkly in the form of Blue and red.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…It’s done.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Huff.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan exhaled a sigh of relief.
 </p>
 <p>
  From 9999 down to level 2, he wondered if it would ever be resolved.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the end, he succeeded in trapping HeavenNet within the sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Continuing to extinguish the Red legacy with Blue from here on out should finish it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then… shall I return?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Although eliminating HeavenNet felt like it took a long while…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Even if many years have passed, it can’t be much…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Yeah.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how much time has passed, it’s just a few years.
 </p>
 <p>
  With that thought, Seong Jihan began his return.
 </p>
 <p>

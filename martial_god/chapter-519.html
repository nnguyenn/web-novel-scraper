  Chapter 519
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan surveyed his surroundings.
 </p>
 <p>
  With HeavenNet gone, he found himself in a world steeped in darkness.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this place not suited for anyone below administrator level, various energies ran rampant, swirling chaotically.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘HeavenNet was installed near Washington, if I remember correctly.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Recalling his past memories, Seong Jihan navigated through the dark expanse.
 </p>
 <p>
  While maintaining the Blue and red sword behind his back restricted his full capacity, he still progressed at a transcendent pace.
 </p>
 <p>
  After advancing for a while,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, light invaded the omnipresent darkness.
 </p>
 <p>
  Light and darkness.
 </p>
 <p>
  Positioned in the realm of darkness, Seong Jihan spotted a light-filled building and his eyes gleamed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I see English on that building.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even from here, the mismatched sizes of buildings looked unmanaged, but the signs displayed a language clearly used in America.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I arrived earlier than I thought.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud, thud.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan approached the sharp boundary where light and darkness diverged.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as he was about to cross it,
 </p>
 <p>
  [BattleNet system detects ‘irregularity’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Ziiiiing…!
 </p>
 <p>
  A message window blocked his path.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I thought it was going too smoothly.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He thought just walking back would solve everything, but that was rarely how things worked.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan paused to see what would display next.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Excluded Administrator, ‘Blue Administrator,’ information partially matches with player.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [BattleNet entry is denied.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Why was he marked as an expelled member?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked incredulous.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had wholeheartedly defended against BattleNet’s rival platform, HeavenNet, yet the system now treated him as a criminal.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Initiating detailed inspection.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Level… detected as 2. No match found with Blue Administrator.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stat… ‘Blue’ is significantly detected. 99 percent match with Blue Administrator.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Title… ‘The Martial God’ detected. 100 percent match with Blue Administrator.]
 </p>
 <p>
  While these messages began to appear,
 </p>
 <p>
  The system continued comparing Seong Jihan’s information with that of the Blue Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  Excluding his level, all other matching data aligned.
 </p>
 <p>
  Beep, beep…
 </p>
 <p>
  An alarm sounded from the message window,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Inspection results, the player matches 98 percent with the Blue Administrator.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Not 100 percent. Was it because my level is 2?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Level seemed to account significantly in the inspection.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan pondered as he waited to see what the system would say next.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ziiiiing…
 </p>
 <p>
  A white-background message window popped up.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Entry is not permitted.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [To enter BattleNet, please reduce your resemblance with the Blue Administrator.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [It is recommended to reset your ‘Blue’ stat.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [It is recommended to reset your ‘Red’ stat.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Reset my stats?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan snorted.
 </p>
 <p>
  As if he would do that.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dropping to level 2 might be an opportunity to re-grow easily and gain more points, but resetting his stats was out of the question.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s a better way than resetting.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan grasped the Blue and Red sword floating behind him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although it was created to seal HeavenNet, its power as a sword was formidable.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Maybe it’s even superior to Taiji Sword.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thunk!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan raised Blue and Red Sword, piercing through the pristine message window.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, not only the message window but the boundary between light and darkness was immediately breached.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle…
 </p>
 <p>
  The shattered message window turned into light, and cracks began forming in the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘One more thrust should get me through.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan prepared to thrust Blue and red again,
 </p>
 <p>
  Tap, tap…
 </p>
 <p>
  Sounds of cracks from beyond his location were heard.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  A hat pierced through the space.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is that…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The hat owned by the Arena’s Owner?
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan’s eyes widened,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  A void energy emanated from the hat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There, there… Uncle!!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Tears streaming, Yoon Seah appeared and embraced him tightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really, why did you take so long…?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan patted the back of the tearful Yoon Seah within his embrace.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seeing you like this, seems like some time has passed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At his words, Yoon Seah pouted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “A bit? More than five years have passed since Uncle disappeared!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Five years?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s eyes widened slightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  More time had passed than he thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although reducing the level and the domain of HeavenNet took a while,
 </p>
 <p>
  He hadn’t realized it had been five years.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Has everything been alright in the meantime?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright?…”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s question, Yoon Seah’s complexion darkend.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even at her arrival through the hat, her face had looked pale.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing her face change color now,
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">

 </div>
 <p>
  It seemed something significant had indeed occurred.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What, something happened to sister?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mom? Mom’s fine. It’s you who’s the problem, uncle.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  No.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was trapped for five years, what could possibly be the issue?
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan looked puzzled,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh… this isn’t the best place to talk. Should we go home first?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah looked around and then suggested.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Let’s go home.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As she removed the hat,
 </p>
 <p>
  Shooo…
 </p>
 <p>
  From an inner space of the bowler hat, a dark vortex swirled, and a purple portal appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This… that’s a considerable amount of void.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the strength contained in such a casual gesture, awe appeared in Seong Jihan’s eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ve become powerful?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I put in some effort trying to find you, uncle.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Have you already become the owner of the Arena?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, not yet. But it’s almost the same.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems so. The energy of the void gives it away.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan conversed, he stepped into the portal.
 </p>
 <p>
  And soon, the familiar scene of the living room came into view.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Long time no see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Returning home after five years.
 </p>
 <p>
  Truthfully, he was so busy sealing HeavenNet that he hadn’t realized how much time had passed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, the familiar sight of the living room brought him relief.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  From within Blue and red sword, a burst of red light flashed, spreading intense heat around.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Ah, can’t carry this around in daily life.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Blue and Red, rebelling against HeavenNet’s control, emanated tremendous heat.
 </p>
 <p>
  Carrying it in everyday life was impractical.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan pondered how to handle Blue and Red.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should store it inside me for now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He brought the sword up behind his neck.
 </p>
 <p>
  Chiik…
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, Blue and Red seeped into his neck and back, forming a tattoo-like sword on his back.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll keep it like this until I can safely bring it out.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan contemplated how to deal with Blue and Red,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah arrived belatedly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh, uncle… what is that sword? The portal got cut off, so I had to open it again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a rather strong sword.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That doesn’t seem like just ‘strong’… and hey, you’ve got a new tattoo on your neck? And it’s sealed?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, I figured it would melt the house if I left it be.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ahaha.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah nodded as she surveyed the scorched interior of the house.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, what was that you were saying earlier?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The thing about a problem with me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, what kind of issue would I be unaware of?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s… where do I even begin…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Struggling with how to explain the situation to Seong Jihan,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, uncle. Can you look outside the window? It’s night right now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pointing to the living room window,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why the window?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ll feel the change immediately. I’ll sort my thoughts in the meantime.”
 </p>
 <p>
  What sort of trouble required time to sort thoughts?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan chuckled and approached the living room window.
 </p>
 <p>
  Usually, Seong Jihan preferred this window over the main door.
 </p>
 <p>
  A large full moon was hanging in the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  Had the cityscape changed?
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan leaned out to look below the window,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, no major changes.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The night view of Seoul made it hard to sense extraordinary changes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just the usual big city.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘She’s not talking about remnants of the sword scar.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A streak of blue light that stretched from the land to the sky.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
 </p>
 <p>
  The traces of the sword Seong Jihan had used to slay the Red Administrator still shone brilliantly after five years, but it hardly felt like a significant change over five years.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then what was he supposed to see?
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as Seong Jihan was about to survey the world once more,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Above in the sky, the full moon suddenly radiated light,
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What’s that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  A green tree-like figure appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you see, uncle?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. Why’s there a tree popping out of the full moon?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s because… the Earth has become a colony of the World Tree Alliance.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What? A colony?”
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  During the five years Seong Jihan was gone,
 </p>
 <p>
  Humanity, belonging to the Bronze league, thrived.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Throughout the regular season of three years, we eventually finished as the first in the Bronze league.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Without falling behind the World Tree Alliance?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. Objectively, they are stronger than humanity, but strangely, they conceded a lot, even in your absence, uncle.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Humanity had retained their number one ranking with the World Tree Alliance’s concessions.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that time, humanity’s confidence peaked.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, during the playoffs that followed the regular season,
 </p>
 <p>
  “They didn’t ban me from the World Tree Alliance, so we swept all matches 3:0.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They didn’t ban you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. It was almost like they were encouraging us to win every match 3:0.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, soon to be the Arena’s Owner.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her power was too much for the Bronze league to handle.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Normally, the opposing teams would always ban her outright,
 </p>
 <p>
  But the World Tree Alliance, fully aware of her strength, always allowed her to play.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, humanity finished first in the regular season and swept through the playoffs.
 </p>
 <p>
  “BattleNet gave us the option to either withdraw or advance to the Silver league.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really? I heard you need to win the Bronze league three times to get that option.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We thought so too… but when we achieved ‘undefeated victory in playoffs,’ they allowed us to choose early.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s gaze darkened.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Was this why the World Tree Alliance deliberately conceded to humanity?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Withdraw or advance.
 </p>
 <p>
  To present this choice,
 </p>
 <p>
  The World Tree Alliance had deliberately induced their own defeat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, did humanity choose to advance?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes… A lot of people experienced it when the Red Administrator descended, right? What it feels like to be reduced to the lowest species.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Stumbling in the BattleNet league was one thing,
 </p>
 <p>
  But having dominated the Bronze league, humanity was overflowing with confidence.
 </p>
 <p>
  They could smoothly sail in BattleNet while enjoying these benefits.
 </p>
 <p>
  And that confidence,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right after moving up to the Silver league, humanity was completely crushed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, I was immediately banned, and the capabilities of the other players didn’t measure up to the Silver league average.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The overwhelming performance that brought them to the Silver league.
 </p>
 <p>
  But that place was far more brutal than humanity had anticipated.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We managed to win one match in a year…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So you ended up at the bottom.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, we were overwhelmingly last in the league. If things continued, we would have faced species extermination…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if they finished last in the Silver league,
 </p>
 <p>
  It was not a matter of dropping to Bronze, but facing extinction, that’s the BattleNet system.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did the Green Administrator save you? In return, made this a colony?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Exactly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “From what you’ve said, it sounds like the World Tree Alliance planned to make this a colony.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. I suspect so.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yggdrasil.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Green Administrator had been fairly cooperative before,
 </p>
 <p>
  But he hadn’t expected them to turn Earth into a colony while he was away.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So the issue you mentioned, that’s about humanity becoming a colony?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…No. The problem’s with the World Tree Alliance. They said if humanity wants to be a colony, they must first relinquish their faith.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What faith?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “In the ‘Blue Administrator Seong Jihan’.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is this, a religion?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan looked bewildered by the talk of ‘faith’,
 </p>
 <p>
  “It was, until recently.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah replied seriously.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Anyway, humanity agreed to survive. And the ‘Blue Administrator Seong Jihan’ was subjected to ‘eradication from records’.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Eradication from records?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Look at this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Extending her hand, a handset flew towards her.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  After unlocking it, she typed ‘Seong Jihan’ into a portal site.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Only records of people with the same name appeared,
 </p>
 <p>
  But none were related to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nothing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yep, not just on the internet. You have been completely forgotten by people too…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah… For survival, humanity has abandoned you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah’s expression grew somber.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…The traces of that blue sword are now considered an inexplicable natural phenomenon. The credit for evolving humanity to this point has been taken by the Green Administrator.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Green Administrator suggested an eradication from records.
 </p>
 <p>
  Was this not only about erasing records but also making people forget Seong Jihan from their memories?
 </p>
 <p>
  Still.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah, you remember me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Mom and I were so pissed, we fully switched to the Void. We’re no longer affiliated with humanity.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sister too? Then it’s no big deal.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, uncle. It’s not that it’s not a problem…! People have forgotten, they did it to save themselves!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah grew even more upset.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why, it’s enough if the family remembers, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan chuckled at her reaction.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’ll be easier to go to restaurants, at least. I was too famous to go anywhere before.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What are you talking about restaurants? You don’t even eat.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “To me, that’s all my name was worth.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan responded while recalling the earlier messages.
 </p>
 <p>
  -BattleNet system detects ‘irregularity’.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Excluded Administrator, ‘Blue Administrator,’ information matches with player.
 </p>
 <p>
  Irregularity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Excluded Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  And eradication from records.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the last five years, apart from humanity’s downfall,
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed a lot had happened in the administrative realm concerning his status.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘First, I need to understand what’s going on.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking this, Seong Jihan waved goodbye to Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll step out for a bit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay… where are you going?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “To see the world.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  He jumped from the window down to downtown Gangnam.
 </p>
 <p>
  There, people briefly turned their gaze towards him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What, who is that guy…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He jumped from that building… Can anyone really land from that height?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, forget it. Must be a player.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike before, when everyone would notice Seong Jihan’s landing,
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, only a few reacted to such a spectacle.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really, nobody recognizes me…”
 </p>
 <p>
  This felt strangely liberating.
 </p>
 <p>
  Smirking at the crowd’s reaction, Seong Jihan,
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud, thud.
 </p>
 <p>
  Naturally blended into the throngs of people.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, he returned to Earth after five years as an anonymous figure.

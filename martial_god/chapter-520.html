  Chapter 520
 </p>
 <p>
  Earth became a World Tree Alliance colony.
 </p>
 <p>
  Under the rule of the elves, humanity’s society…
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Seems more peaceful than I thought.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It was running smoothly, much like before.
 </p>
 <p>
  The busy streets of Gangnam in Seoul.
 </p>
 <p>
  To understand how the world had changed, Seong Jihan came here.
 </p>
 <p>
  Observing the passersby,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The racial evolution is maintained at a mid-low level.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Humanity, who had risen from the lowest to mid-low level in racial evolution, remained the same as before.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Man, compared to the old days, I hardly ever get drunk now, even after three rounds, I still feel sober.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, you wanna go back to the days you used to puke?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you crazy? How did the World Tree evolve us to this point… Just drink stronger stuff then!”
 </p>
 <p>
  People, looking perfectly fine, were searching for the next bar.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hearing praises for the World Tree everywhere, Seong Jihan’s eyebrow twitched.
 </p>
 <p>
  The credit for lifting humanity from the lowest status was all taken by the Green Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘She was so cooperative as the administrator… How should I deal with this?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Truthfully, he had enough power.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
 </p>
 <p>
  Though his level had dropped to 2, his abilities were intact.
 </p>
 <p>
  In fact, not only did dealing with HeavenNet advance his power in Blue, but he also augmented Red’s strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  Regardless of the Green Administrator’s power, it was a fight worth taking on.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to assess the situation first.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He had returned from HeavenNet just one day ago,
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no need to rush.
 </p>
 <p>
  Finding out the enemy’s intentions first and then moving accordingly was wiser.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Green Administrator must have had a reason to make this place a colony.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The World Tree elves Seong Jihan knew were a brutal race.
 </p>
 <p>
  Under Yggdrasil’s control, they wiped out native life forms on planets and transformed them into World Tree elf planets.
 </p>
 <p>
  Making a place a colony inconvenient for ruling was not their usual approach.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But actually, making it a colony, on the surface, it appears peaceful like five years ago…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Surely, there must be a motive behind this.
 </p>
 <p>
  Until this was revealed, he should conserve Blue and Red for now.
 </p>
 <p>
  While contemplating this about the tree pattern that appeared and disappeared repetitively on the moon,
 </p>
 <p>
  Screeeech!
 </p>
 <p>
  A limousine stopped in the middle of the road.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What, what’s happening? A limousine here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… There’s a club here, remember? Maybe it’s because of that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who could it be?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As people watched with curiosity as the long limousine stopped in front of the club,
 </p>
 <p>
  Squeak.
 </p>
 <p>
  The club’s security personally opened the car door.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, a woman was the first to reveal herself.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…What is that appearance?’
 </p>
 <p>
  With mixed black and blonde hair, slightly pointed ears,
 </p>
 <p>
  A woman with extraordinarily pale skin near the ears,
 </p>
 <p>
  Her appearance was distinctly different from ordinary people.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her slightly twisted features,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm… Is this the energy of life?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to others, a much denser vitality energy was emanating from her.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan was attentively observing her,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh… A half-elf? I’ve only seen them on BattleTube, but seeing one in real life today!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow, I envy… That’s like winning the lottery, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, winning the lottery? Half-elf, that’s more like a month’s earnings!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Cool ears…”
 </p>
 <p>
  People’s murmurs mentioning ‘half-elf’ surrounded her.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A half-elf, huh.’
 </p>
 <p>
  No wonder it seemed too peaceful for a colony.
 </p>
 <p>
  The World Tree Alliance, they were not idle after all.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Should I start with her?’
 </p>
 <p>
  As the woman half-elf was walking towards the club,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Another person emerged from the limousine.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Who’s this character?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Immediately, Seong Jihan’s expression turned grim.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  The man scanned his surroundings with a confident look.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  “Wow, a male half-elf…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow! I’ve never seen one before!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The response from the people was much more enthusiastic compared to when the woman half-elf appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That man… He oddly resembles me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A male half-elf, distinctly different from the woman.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though not an exact match, his resemblance to Seong Jihan was quite striking.
 </p>
 <p>
  The difference was the pointed ears.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What’s with his hair?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Certain parts of his hair were dyed sky-blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow, it’s been a while, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t it almost three months since a man was selected here in our country?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right… I need to take a picture.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Click. Click.
 </p>
 <p>
  People took photos more fervently than with the female half-elf.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please, no photos!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The club’s security crowded around the male half-elf, leading him inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aw… Wanted to take more shots.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “His sky-blue hair is fascinating… About 10%? With that much dyeing, isn’t he a pretty outstanding half-elf?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Probably? They say the power differs by the extent of dyeing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As people chattered regretfully about the vanishing male half-elf,
 </p>
 <p>
  Tap. Tap.
 </p>
 <p>
  Someone tapped Seong Jihan from the side.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  He turned his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh wow, looks just like…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A man with a flushed face, swaying as he examined Seong Jihan closely.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey! Where did you get your plastic surgery?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you talking about?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Admit it, you got plastic surgery to look like the male half-elf! This looks better than the place I went to.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He got plastic surgery to look like the male half-elf?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan furrowed his brows.
 </p>
 <p>
  Listening to him under the influence, indeed, the man’s altered face somewhat resembled his own.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Yggdrasil… What are you up to?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Although all his records were erased,
 </p>
 <p>
  Why create a male half-elf resembling him?
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan withheld answering, staring down at the man,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sorry. He’s a lightweight with alcohol…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, it’s amazing! He looks exactly like the male half-elf! That’s the standard to pass the ‘test’!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You nuts? Enough with the drinking. He doesn’t look like him at all!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are your eyes blind? Look closely!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey! This way!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The man’s friends hastily dragged him away.
 </p>
 <p>
  As they left, Seong Jihan tilted his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Now that I think about it, it’s strange.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite roaming Gangnam’s streets for quite a while,
 </p>
 <p>
  The drunken man was the first to mention he looked like the male half-elf.
 </p>
 <p>
  Others just passed him by without a second glance.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is this the effect of the record erasure?’
 </p>
 <p>
  A sober person couldn’t see, but a drunk could see his face more clearly?
 </p>
 <p>
  Something felt off.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to investigate this male half-elf further.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He had sky-blue hair and looked quite like him.
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  The Green Administrator making Earth a colony was likely tied to this.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Now that I have something to investigate, let’s head back.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan turned around.
 </p>
 <p>
  To the Sword Palace, a bit away from downtown Gangnam.
 </p>
 <p>
  But at his current level,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  A single step teleported him back.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he entered through the penthouse window,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle, why are you so late? What were you looking at?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah rose from the sofa.
 </p>
 <p>
  Glancing at the clock, it was already 2 AM.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, with a bemused expression, asked her,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you wait for me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course. It’s been so long since I found you! I was so unsure if this was a dream or reality? I stayed here to not miss you.”
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  “Then you could’ve contacted… Ah, no way to contact me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Without a phone and erased from BattleNet,
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah had no means of contacting him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Guess I need to buy a phone first. Has phone technology improved over five years?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well… Probably? I was wandering around Washington looking for you, so not quite sure.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Washington?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. Oh, you wouldn’t know? The U.S. capital was moved to New York.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Washington became a wasteland.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Was it due to HeavenNet?
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan’s face grew stern, Yoon Seah quickly continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But the domain’s expansion was slow, so everyone evacuated. The U.S. President shed tears watching the White House get swallowed though…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so? Well, at least no one died.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. They planned to call the presidential residence in New York ‘Blue House’ to honor you who saved America.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But Blue House is just Cheong Wa Dae’s English name.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan chuckled in disbelief.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. But now it’s changed to Green House… Credit for saving America went to the Green Administrator.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah replied with a grim face.
 </p>
 <p>
  From White to Blue, and then Green.
 </p>
 <p>
  The U.S. presidential residence’s name changed quite turbulently.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, that aside. I saw something interesting earlier.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Interesting?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, a male and female half-elf in front of a club. The woman looked like the elves I saw before, but the man resembled me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What? A half-elf resembling you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, don’t you know?”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s question, Yoon Seah shook her head, looking surprised.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No… I was searching for you in Washington after Earth became a colony. Gathering all the power of Void. So, I don’t know much except the early changes of the colony.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How long did you search in Washington?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm, about 2 years? Went through every nook and cranny…”
 </p>
 <p>
  An investigation tougher than finding a needle in a haystack, searching for a clue in Washington.
 </p>
 <p>
  She spent 2 years combing through it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You must’ve had a hard time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You had it harder, Uncle.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, nothing much for me. Just worked the Red Administrator.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Worked him….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. That guy sacrificed himself in Hell while giving me all authority.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator, utterly devoted to perfecting HeavenNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the end, he made himself the fuel to maintain the new system.
 </p>
 <p>
  By making Seong Jihan, HeavenNet’s arch-nemesis, the system’s master,
 </p>
 <p>
  He eliminated his weaknesses.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The lure of Red stats was indeed strong….’
 </p>
 <p>
  Dropping level from 9999 to 2, he had to raise Red reluctantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each time he leveled up Red, the sense of unity with HeavenNet was intensely profound.
 </p>
 <p>
  Without his desperate self-protection through Blue, he would’ve become HeavenNet’s master.
 </p>
 <p>
  “After sealing it completely, I didn’t expect BattleNet to expel me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Expel… Uncle, you got expelled?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. They identified me as an excluded administrator.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s just cruel. Why didn’t you just become HeavenNet’s master?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan chuckled, shaking his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That wouldn’t work. It would’ve made me and the Red Administrator one and the same. That was his intention.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, I see…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What did the Black Administrator do all this time? Did he just watch while the White Administrator acted?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Given that the White Administrator intervened, the Black Administrator should have responded.
 </p>
 <p>
  But it seemed like no change was perceptible,
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering humanity became a Green colony.
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s query, Yoon Seah answered with a dark expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t really know. The messenger informed me that the Black Administrator personally intervened to solve this situation… but there was no contact afterward.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, later only received a message saying ‘well resolved’. Can’t feel any differences though.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite being designated as the top-tier in Void, ‘Arena’s Owner’,
 </p>
 <p>
  The information she could gather was limited.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Looks like I’ll have to handle Yggdrasil to find out what happened.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Black and White Administrators.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not understanding their situation, moving overtly was inadvisable.
 </p>
 <p>
  If incredibly unlucky, Void and the White Administrator might have resumed their cooperation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Of course, if Void took their side, there would’ve been immediate response upon contacting Seah… that’s unlikely.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As the situation remained unclear, it was best to conceal his power for now.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking this, Seong Jihan’s left eye,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle, your eye…”
 </p>
 <p>
  began to turn red.

  Chapter 521
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  Summoned by Seong Jihan to shut down HeavenNet, he tried desperately to persuade him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Think again, Blue Administrator.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He exerted all his efforts to convince Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You are already the master and permanent administrator of this world. You can do anything you wish here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “HeavenNet is a system that can completely replace BattleNet and upgrade it. You just need to accept the enemy instead of erasing them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… Why are you so intent on destroying this world?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s response remained consistent.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stop it and just help me erase it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, the Red Administrator cooperated in dismantling the HeavenNet he had created with his own hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, even in that situation, he persistently tried to sway Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  One such attempt involved showing him how to use the Red stat.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Red Administrator was indeed a genius concerning the system.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Sssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  As his left eye turned red, the Red glow began to radiate from his neck, specifically from the tattoo of the Blue and Red Sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle… what are you doing?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just hiding some power.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hiding power?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Yoon Seah tilted her head in curiosity, Seong Jihan smiled.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator had a knack for distorting and modifying the BattleNet system to some extent.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks to his teachings, Seong Jihan had learned to some degree how to mimic such feats.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well… in case Yggdrasil tries to flee.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Red Authority
 </p>
 <p>
  Sacred Flame
 </p>
 <p>
  Chiiiiik…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s body momentarily blazed, but soon, his eye color reverted to its original black.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh… Uncle, what did you do? I don’t see any changes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You don’t need to worry about it. But others might see things differently.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I disguised myself.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Yoon Seah blinked her eyes, there came a beep. beep. sound from the front door.
 </p>
 <p>
  The person entering was none other than Seong Jihan’s elder sister, Seong Jiah.
 </p>
 <p>
  No longer in her former statue-like state, she had returned to being human.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Seems she finally used the key.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite his repeated urging to use the key when he was around, she had steadfastly refused.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, after five years, some change in her heart had led to her transforming back into a human.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan looked at his now-human sister with satisfaction,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mom! Look, I found Uncle!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah pointed excitedly at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  But,
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Seah, that’s the Messenger?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jiah’s reaction was entirely unexpected.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh? What are you talking about?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Phew… You need some rest. Saying that the starfish form is Jihan… you must’ve had a tough time in Washington?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, Mom! What starfish… Uh? Uncle. Is this…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, it’s the effect of Sacred Flame.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan’s eye glowed red again, Seong Jiah’s mouth opened wide.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Long time no see, Sis.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No way, Jihan?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, I’m back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How is this even possible?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  In an instant, she pounced on Seong Jihan, grabbing him with a trembling voice and asked,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your body… is it okay?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m the healthiest being in this world.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s a relief… Still the same…”
 </p>
 <p>
  As she looked at him with tearful eyes, she hugged and patted his back.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Welcome back, Jihan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan patted her back and smiled, he truly felt he had returned after meeting both Yoon Seah and Seong Jiah.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Great to see you in human form. Finally used the key?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, I used the key…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jiah looked towards Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I passed on all my Void power to Seah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “To Seah?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, she was searching in Washington.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She gathered all her power just to find her uncle.
 </p>
 <p>
  No wonder she possessed such significant Void energy.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Then, the Witch of The Void…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s over. Now, I’m just a human. Though I belong to the Void.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At her words, Seong Jihan smiled broadly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though she belonged to the Void, the fact that his sister returned to human form was worth celebrating.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, the Seong siblings reunited after five years.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Mom, why did you come home so late? It’s already 2 AM.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The national team’s dinner just ended now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Mom, you’re on the national team?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You wanted me to become famous, right? So Jihan could find us anytime.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Indeed, but…”
 </p>
 <p>
  National team?
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, was she back in action as a supporter?
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan pondered this,
 </p>
 <p>
  Buzz. Buzz.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jiah’s phone rang, showing a text message on the screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Jiah, did you get home safely? Sorry about what happened today.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the message from ‘Yoon Sejin,’ Yoon Seah had a peculiar expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Dad?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What happened with your ex-husband?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What happened…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come on, something did. What was it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Yoon Seah asked with keen interest, Seong Jiah sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “A new Half-Elf girl on the national team hit on your dad and got drunk and started ranting at me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ranting?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. She told me to stop hanging around him because we’ve divorced. Kept saying I was preventing him from meeting new people.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Mom, did you hit on Dad?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you kidding? It was the opposite. Your dad got mad at her and slapped the Half-Elf, turning the dinner into a mess.”
 </p>
 <p>
  While explaining, Seong Jiah opened an internet portal site.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thankfully, it’s not made it to the news yet… but it might be an article tomorrow.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Unbelievable… how did this happen on the day we came back?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Indeed. I didn’t feel great today, but now it’s ending on a happy note with my brother back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jiah smiled, Seong Jihan furrowed his brows.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, but is Yoon Sejin still hitting on you even after the divorce?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… not exactly. He just asks about Seah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, although everyone else forgot her… he remembers her.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah…? Why Seah?”
 </p>
 <p>
  What was this now?
 </p>
 <p>
  Wasn’t it only Seong Jihan who was affected by the memory erasure?
 </p>
 <p>
  As he looked at Yoon Seah curiously,
 </p>
 <p>
  She pouted her lips and explained.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh… When the world decided to erase your records to save themselves, I got annoyed and asked the World Tree Alliance to erase my records too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Was that possible?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They were glad I’d disappear on my own. Even allowed me to search Washington freely.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the future owner of the Arena, part of the Void’s highest echelon,
 </p>
 <p>
  The World Tree Alliance probably didn’t want to clash unnecessarily.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So I got the Void power from mom and continued searching Washington.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right. You didn’t contact us for two years.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehe, I was focused on the search…”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Yoon Seah scratched her head and answered, Seong Jihan organized his thoughts.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, people still remember sis?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Although my information is heavily distorted.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “My brother’s existence is erased. And Seah is said to be studying abroad under the World Tree Alliance.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Study abroad with them?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, occasionally. Though not sure if it’s really study…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The world indeed changed too much in the past five years.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought and asked about something that had piqued his interest earlier,
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, what’s the deal with the male Half-Elf? Why does he look like me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, you saw him? I was surprised too. Since about a year ago, male Half-Elves started appearing from the aptitude test. Weirdly resembling you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Does the male Half-Elf really look like uncle? I thought uncle is more handsome?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But doesn’t he resemble Jihan a bit?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…He does? But why is his hair that sky-blue? It’s weird.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They say the degree of dye indicates a Half-Elf’s abilities. The highest record is 25%.”
 </p>
 <p>
  25% being the highest.
 </p>
 <p>
  That means the guy with 10% he saw was quite talented.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan continued querying Seong Jiah.
 </p>

 <p>
  “How do these male Half-Elves come into existence?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Remember the BattleNet league tutorial?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, for me, it started with a survival challenge.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking back to when he returned and awakened his powers with Dongbang Sak’s brush, Seong Jihan answered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s now replaced by an ‘aptitude test.’”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aptitude test?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, it’s a test to measure how well a new player fits as a Half-Elf.”
 </p>
 <p>
  So the Half-Elves came from this aptitude test.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Since it started two years ago, only female Half-Elves existed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So only females could become Half-Elves?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, and female players’ value increased. Until last year.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But what’s so good about being a Half-Elf?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well… everything is five times better for them than an average player. Be it experience gains or additional abilities.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Five times?
 </p>
 <p>
  No wonder people revered them so much.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even a latecomer could catch up swiftly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So are male Half-Elves better?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. For males… it’s about ten times. Plus, they get special management from the World Tree Alliance.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Rewards ten times higher were significant,
 </p>
 <p>
  But what seemed more crucial was the ‘special management’ by the World Tree Alliance.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s worth investigating this more.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan assessed the current situation.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  Earth, now a colony, seemed peaceful on the surface.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the existence of, especially, male Half-Elves who resembled him was highly suspicious.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘With Blue and Red, I have the power to confront them.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Blue and Red sword, which sealed HeavenNet’s power, was absolute.
 </p>
 <p>
  Properly using that sword, the illusion of the World Tree spreading under the moonlight could be shattered instantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  But,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I must conserve my strength until I identify the true enemy.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Black, White, and Green Administrators.
 </p>
 <p>
  Until it was clear who among them was an ally or foe,
 </p>
 <p>
  Recklessly using Blue and Red would be inadvisable.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Green seems to be the enemy for sure, though.’
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no point in using up all his strength only to get stabbed later by a permanent administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah, do you still own Sword Palace?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This building? It’s Mom’s. I transferred the ownership to her before erasing my records.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really? Then sis. Can you set up a room for me to stay nearby? I’ll move out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A room? Why? You can stay here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Surprised by his intentions, Yoon Seah tried to persuade him otherwise.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’ll get in the way of my activities under a new identity if I stay here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He already had a plan in mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  “A new identity…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, I need to take the tutorial to become a male Half-Elf, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, you need to pass the aptitude test.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll take it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle… are you aiming to become a Half-Elf?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Agreeing with her question, Seong Jihan nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The fastest way to understand the enemy is from within.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whiiiiiing…
 </p>
 <p>
  A system window appeared before Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Access denied for this player.]
 </p>
 <p>
  In the current system, BattleNet didn’t allow his access.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  Red Authority
 </p>
 <p>
  Sacred Flame
 </p>
 <p>
  Whrrrr…!
 </p>
 <p>
  As flames ignited at his fingertip,
 </p>
 <p>
  The entire system window burned, and letters in red appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Successfully bypassed the system.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Create a new profile?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [This world is under the Administrator’s watch. A higher authority is required to evade detection.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [300 Red stats will be consumed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘300, huh.’
 </p>
 <p>
  That was quite a hefty amount for creating a new identity.
 </p>
 <p>
  But,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘All the more reason to use it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Without hesitation, Seong Jihan invested his Red stats.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  A new status window began to unfold.

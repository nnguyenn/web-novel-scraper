  Chapter 523
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I didn’t expect to meet these people here.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Daegi Guild Master Lee Hayeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  Possessing the gift of ‘Nurturing’, she had been handling tasks on behalf of Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Publicly, she was known as his lover.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, in reality, it was a means to avoid being married off by her old guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Come to think of it, after the record erasure, how were Daegi Guild’s shares handled? Did they go to sis?’
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan was part of it, Daegi Guild was practically the world’s top guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  The value of these shares far exceeded that of this Sword Palace building.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, Daegi Guild’s value was highly rated because Seong Jihan was a member.
 </p>
 <p>
  It must be cheaper now.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was lost in thought,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please delete the photo.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lim Gayeong, who had stepped out of the elevator, demanded again that the photo be deleted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I didn’t take any.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can you show me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan calmly held out his phone,
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon, who was being carried, slapped Lim Gayeong’s back with her palm.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey! Stop it! I’m sorry… She’s been sensitive about paparazzi lately, excuse her rudeness.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hurry up and apologize to him.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m sorry.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Lim Gayeong bowed her head deeply, Seong Jihan pointed to the elevator with his finger.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Um, can I get in now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, yes. Really sorry about that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After Seong Jihan entered the elevator,
 </p>
 <p>
  “We should have rented the entire floor like before.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We only come here for guild certification, it’s a waste.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “For someone with so much money, you’re quite stingy. You collapse like this every certification, spend a little when needed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The guild is struggling these days… Can’t afford to waste money.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan could faintly hear Lee Hayeon and Lim Gayeong’s voices from beyond the elevator.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What’s this guild certification?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Guild certification didn’t exist before.
 </p>
 <p>
  Did it make the Guild Master collapse from exhaustion?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘And if it was the old Daegi Guild, they wouldn’t have had financial difficulties.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Now it seemed their financial situation wasn’t so good either.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Another thing to look into.’
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s quite a lot to search for over three days.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking this, Seong Jihan entered a convenience store.
 </p>
 <p>
  The interior didn’t seem much different from before.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘All the ad models are Half-Elves.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether it was alcohol or snacks,
 </p>
 <p>
  Anywhere an ad model could be, Half-Elves’ faces were plastered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially, male Half-Elves seemed to be the recent trend.
 </p>
 <p>
  The main advertising spots were all occupied by those who vaguely resembled Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Seeing that face constantly is starting to irritate me…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s body instinctively moved to the alcohol section.
 </p>
 <p>
  And there too, seeing male Half-Elf faces plastered all over the alcohol labels, he frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  Really, they were everywhere.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll have to carefully choose ones without faces.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish. Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  After finishing his shopping, selecting only items without faces, Seong Jihan,
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as he entered his home, turned on the TV.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  A male Half-Elf immediately popped up on the screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, really.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Stop coming out, you crazy bastards.

 <p>
  Beep. Beep.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan quickly changed the channel.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, a news channel appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the desk, an announcer with an expert wore a serious expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The United Colonial Government has warned that if Korea’s racial conversion rate doesn’t meet the standard in the first half of the year, ‘extraordinary measures’ will be taken.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Racial conversion rate.
 </p>
 <p>
  Was it like the rate of becoming Half-Elves?
 </p>
 <p>
  [We’ve invited the director of the BattleNet Management Bureau Research Institute to discuss this. The conversion rate is not good… Doctor, is the situation in Korea that bad?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. Although a male Half-Elf appeared recently after three months, the numbers are woefully inadequate compared to other countries. The number of female Half-Elves was low to begin with.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The research director showed statistical figures.
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed, compared to other countries, Korea’s Elf conversion rate was notably low.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I see… Have you heard anything about the ‘extraordinary measures’ the Colonial Government warned about?]
 </p>
 <p>
  […I’ve heard that the Colonial Government is considering deactivating the dungeon portal suppressors.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You mean…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. If the conversion rate doesn’t improve, dungeon portals might appear much more frequently than now.]
 </p>
 <p>
  What did the dungeon portal have to do with the conversion rate?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan tilted his head and picked up his phone.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the real-time reactions to the current news,
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why the hell can’t Koreans become Elves
 </p>
 <p>
  -But what’s the connection between dungeon portals and conversion rate?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Statistically, countries with more portals have higher conversion rates, though the reason is unknown…
 </p>
 <p>
  -So they’re turning off the suppressors?;
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ah, property values will fall…
 </p>
 <p>
  -They said Seoul was safest because the Colonial Government headquarters is there, but not anymore?
 </p>
 <p>
  He could gather that there was a connection between dungeon portals and Half-Elf conversion rates.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But the Colonial Government headquarters is in Seoul.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was not in America, which was ranked 1st in BattleNet national rankings, but in Korea.
 </p>
 <p>
  Was it because of him?
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking this, Seong Jihan searched for where the Colonial Government headquarters was located.
 </p>
 <p>
  The photo that appeared showed a huge tree stretching from the top of Namsan to the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is this a kind of World Tree… It replaced Namsan Tower.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A giant tree where many Elves, including the World Tree Alliance’s colonial governor, reside.
 </p>
 <p>
  This had become a must-visit spot for foreigners coming to Korea.
 </p>
 <p>
  Colonial subjects taking commemorative photos at the Colonial Government…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They seem to have no resentment about becoming a colony.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Having been to the convenience store, it was time to thoroughly investigate what human society was like under colonial rule.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should look into the Daegi Guild situation too.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan turned on his computer and began collecting information in earnest.
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  Three days later.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I see… It’s understandable why they like the colonial state.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After gathering as much information as possible about the changed human society, Seong Jihan twisted the corner of his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Everything I’ve accomplished is now credited to Yggdrasil.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Raising humanity from the lowest tier to the lower-middle tier.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
 </p>
 <p>
  The rapid growth from Bronze League to Silver League.
 </p>
 <p>
  Saving them by accepting them as a colony when they were at risk of relegation in the league due to side effects of rapid growth.
 </p>
 <p>
  All were recorded as results of Yggdrasil’s care for humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Moreover, after becoming a colony, the number of dungeon portals decreased and the world became more stable.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Before becoming a colony, during the time when they were at the bottom of the Silver League,
 </p>
 <p>
  Humanity was in considerable danger due to dungeon portals appearing simultaneously in various regions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially in countries with low national rankings,
 </p>
 <p>
  Some of the lowest-ranked countries were already struggling to function as nations.
 </p>
 <p>
  But after becoming a colony of the World Tree Elves, the frequency of dungeon portal generation was reduced by more than half.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Seoul and the metropolitan area, where the Colonial Government is located, didn’t have any dungeon portals.’
 </p>
 <p>
  World Tree Elves who evolve species and ensure safety.
 </p>
 <p>
  With so many benefits received and almost no exploitation after becoming a colony,
 </p>
 <p>
  It was understandable that humanity was satisfied under colonial rule.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The World Tree Elves aren’t such a peaceful species though.’
 </p>
 <p>
  World Tree Elves.

 <p>
  This species following the green administrator Yggdrasil was the most notorious group in the BattleNet world.
 </p>
 <p>
  To the extent that if you guessed anything bad was related to World Tree Elves, you’d usually be right.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were the furthest from the concept of peace.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet there must be a reason for them to act this way.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Half-Elves seem to be their primary objective for now…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Half-Elves.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially the recently emerged male type, the World Tree Alliance showed great interest in them.
 </p>
 <p>
  They even gave preferential treatment to countries based on how many male Half-Elves they produced.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the Colonial Government showing such interest,
 </p>
 <p>
  Naturally, the popularity of male Half-Elves skyrocketed in human society.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether in Korea or abroad, these Half-Elves who vaguely resembled Seong Jihan were dominating the advertising market these days.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll have to become one to understand why the Colonial Government treats them so well.’
 </p>
 <p>
  There were limits to the information accessible as an ordinary person.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to become a male Half-Elf himself to uncover their purpose.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, now that I have some time left… Let’s search for the guild situation.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Recalling his encounter with Lee Hayeon a few days ago, he searched for information about the Daegi Guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Daegi Guild, 7-tier drop in guild ranking. Falls out of TOP 5]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Daegi Guild falling behind the times. What’s the problem?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Rumors of Sword King Yoon Sejin’s transfer]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Divergent guild reiterates intention to acquire Daegi Guild]
 </p>
 <p>
  Articles that looked clearly unfavorable started popping up one after another.
 </p>
 <p>
  And from the comments below these articles, he could grasp the situation to some extent.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why the hell is Daegi Guild collapsing like this? I invested 100,000 GP here…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Maybe it’s because you invested?
 </p>
 <p>
  -They always lose in the Half-Elf recruitment battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  -What era are they living in with their nurturing guild? The most important thing in guild evaluations these days is the number of Half-Elves.
 </p>
 <p>
  -But I wonder why their guild evaluation was so high in the first place;
 </p>
 <p>
  -True, the Guild Master’s skill is OP, but it wasn’t enough to be world rank 1 or 2.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Just rejoin the Divergent guild. I heard the Guild Master is from Divergent too.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So Half-Elves have become the standard for guild evaluation.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In the past, players wanted to join the Daegi Guild because of Lee Hayeon’s exceptional ‘Nurturing’ skill.
 </p>
 <p>
  But in a world where the number of Half-Elves takes priority over growth, its advantage would naturally diminish.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, what boosted Daegi Guild’s evaluation was largely the presence of its owner, Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  With both him and Yoon Seah, who became rank 1 after him, suffering record erasure,
 </p>
 <p>
  It was natural for the guild’s evaluation to plummet.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Still, they must have earned a lot over the years. I wonder why they couldn’t recruit Half-Elves.’
 </p>
 <p>
  They say the rich can weather three generations of hardship.
 </p>
 <p>
  The money Daegi Guild earned during its prime was enormous.
 </p>
 <p>
  If times had changed, couldn’t they have used that money to recruit Half-Elves?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan pondered this question and looked into it.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is Daegi Guild still investing in nurturing effects?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Probably, that’s all they have left here.
 </p>
 <p>
  -To maintain the buff effect, they need to do guild certification every month, and the GP cost for this is no joke.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yeah, people started leaving in droves when this item came up at the investment briefing lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ah, my money… Just sell to divergent already
 </p>
 <p>
  The ‘guild certification’, a necessary procedure to maintain the nurturing buff.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because of this, Daegi Guild was burning through all the GP they had earned.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Guild certification… It didn’t exist in my time.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Could it be related to the owner, Seong Jihan, being absent?
 </p>
 <p>
  The guild should be on the lower floor anyway.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought about looking into this, but then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The BattleNet League tutorial will begin soon.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s under the jurisdiction of the Green Administrator. The tutorial is replaced with an ‘Aptitude Test’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As if time was up,
 </p>
 <p>
  A green message window appeared before his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘First, I need to become a Half-Elf.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [When you’re ready, respond to the summons.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You will be forcibly summoned in 5 minutes.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan responded to the summons,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  His body was enveloped in green light and disappeared.

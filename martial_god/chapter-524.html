  Chapter 524𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  [Player ‘Kim Jihun’ enters ‘Aptitude Test Room – Korea Zone 1’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Summoned to the aptitude test room, Seong Jihan looked around.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They called it a test room, but it’s just a forest.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside a forest densely packed with trees so large the sky was barely visible.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he ignored the map name, it felt like being stranded in a tropical rainforest.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Step. Step.
 </p>
 <p>
  A World Tree Elf slowly walked over and smiled at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Welcome, Player ‘Kim Jihun’. I am the ‘High Elf Priestess’ in charge of guidance.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The woman who called herself the High Elf Priestess,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll guide you this way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After politely bowing her head to Seong Jihan, she led him deeper into the forest.
 </p>
 <p>
  After walking for a short while,
 </p>
 <p>
  He was guided by the elf to the front of a massive tree glowing green.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well then, Mr. Kim Jihun, please wait in the waiting room, and we’ll call you when it’s time for your test.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The ‘waiting room’ the elf pointed to was,
 </p>
 <p>
  A place across from the giant tree packed with chairs.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the waiting room with about 30 wooden chairs,
 </p>
 <p>
  Only one seat was empty.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Was I the last one for Zone 1?’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan strode towards the empty seat,
 </p>
 <p>
  He heard murmuring from around him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh… it’s a man.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There are five men in Zone 1 this time. Quite a lot.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Maybe we’ll get a male Half-Elf today.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There are a lot of men with Cross-Species Affinity in this batch, aren’t there?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Were there this many B-grade or higher…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  In the waiting room where 25 out of 30 were women,
 </p>
 <p>
  People looked at Seong Jihan, wearing Kim Jihun’s shell, with interested eyes and chatted among themselves.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They said only players with the Cross-Species Affinity gift are summoned to Zones 1 through 10.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The zone numbers assigned in the aptitude test room were based on the probability of becoming a Half-Elf,
 </p>
 <p>
  Since women had a higher chance of becoming Half-Elves than men, Zone 1 was usually dominated by women.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially since Zone 1 was only for those with Cross-Species Affinity of at least B-grade,
 </p>
 <p>
  It was rare to have as many as five men gathered here.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan sat down in the empty seat, drawing attention from those around,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, the last person has arrived!”
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the men sitting rose abruptly and approached Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Excuse me… are you perhaps affiliated with a guild?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The man who approached Seong Jihan was a middle-aged man in a suit.
 </p>
 <p>
  With his hair half balding, he had quite a few wrinkles on his forehead.
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering that the human species had evolved two stages, this level of aging should only be possible for those over 60.
 </p>
 <p>
  But below that, his facial features unpleasantly resembled Seong Jihan’s.
 </p>
 <p>
  A face that clearly showed signs of plastic surgery.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Ah… really.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan immediately understood why this person looked like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the current world where the superstition that resembling the appearance of male Half-Elves increases the chances of passing the aptitude test is widespread,
 </p>
 <p>
  In the medical field, which was generally struggling as humanity evolved to mid-tier, the only growing area was plastic surgery.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a world where everyone was going under the knife to resemble the features of male Half-Elves.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘At this point, this is more irritating than humanity becoming a colony…’
 </p>
 <p>
  While thinking this, Seong Jihan outwardly showed no reaction and answered,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Guild? I don’t have a guild.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What, you don’t have a guild??”
 </p>
 <p>
  The moment he said he didn’t have a guild, the other person immediately switched to informal speech,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Haha, well… why on earth did you do that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  He started lecturing Seong Jihan like a life senior.
 </p>
 <p>
  “As soon as you received your gift, you should have contracted with a guild and received a signing bonus! What if you fail the aptitude test coming empty-handed like this!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s only been a few days since my gift awakened.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Tsk tsk, you should have contacted the top 5 guilds right away! Oh my. This friend just threw away the lottery…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pat. Pat.
 </p>
 <p>
  The middle-aged man came closer, patting Seong Jihan’s shoulder and sighing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just because he said he hadn’t contracted with a guild,
 </p>
 <p>
  The man immediately switched to informal speech and started giving advice, which made Seong Jihan chuckle inwardly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s been a while since I’ve been treated like this.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In his time as Seong Jihan, he never had to endure such casual disrespect.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was certainly different now that he’s become ‘Kim Jihun’.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Actually, what he’s saying is correct.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Male Half-Elves were indeed much rarer compared to females.
 </p>
 <p>
  While women occasionally became Half-Elves even without the Cross-Species Affinity gift,
 </p>
 <p>
  Men basically all needed to have the ‘Cross-Species Affinity’ gift,
 </p>
 <p>
  And even then, the probability was less than 1 percent.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, male players who obtained the ‘Cross-Species Affinity’ gift,
 </p>
 <p>
  Often contacted large guilds before the aptitude test, receiving large signing bonuses and pre-contracts.
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Rather than aiming for a jackpot with less than 1% success rate, prepare for failure in advance.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was the thinking of the majority of men who received the ‘Cross-Species Affinity’ gift these days.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Coming without a pre-contract… that person must be rich.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He doesn’t look like it though?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s why. If he had money, he would have gotten full plastic surgery in advance.”
 </p>
 <p>
  People in the waiting area whispered, seemingly having overheard their conversation.
 </p>
 <p>
  But before the conversation could continue,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash…!
 </p>
 <p>
  A green light flashed at the front of the waiting area.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, looks like it’s starting.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing this, the middle-aged man who had been meddling returned to his seat,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  At the front of the waiting room,
 </p>
 <p>
  The High Elf Priestess gradually appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now that everyone has gathered, we will begin the aptitude test.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As she said this, she pointed behind her.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Part of the tree trunk hollowed out,
 </p>
 <p>
  Revealing a space just large enough for one person to enter.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then I will call out the waiting numbers starting from number 1. Number 1, Player Jung Yoonha.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Y-Yes!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please enter this way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the female player in front stood up, tension enveloped the waiting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Zing…
 </p>
 <p>
  On the side of the tree, a large message window appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Zone 1 Test Results]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Qualified: 0 Waiting: 30]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The progress of Zone 1 testing will be broadcast on BattleTube.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as the message about starting the BattleTube broadcast appeared,
 </p>
 <p>
  -Zone 1 has opened!!
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh, 5 men keke Last month there were only 2.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is something big coming today?!
 </p>
 <p>
  -Something big? Demongod is swole.
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers’ messages started appearing in real-time on that message window.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  The aptitude test.
 </p>
 <p>
  This crucial test that determined whether one becomes a Half-Elf or not,
 </p>
 <p>
  Was actually simple in its method.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘You just go in there and come out, that’s it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  When the examinee enters the hollowed-out tree trunk,
 </p>
 <p>
  The entire tree flashes green and the test begins.
 </p>
 <p>
  Those with the potential to become Half-Elves stayed inside the tree longer.
 </p>
 <p>
  Those without potential were ejected within 1 minute.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps because of this,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Number 21. Player Lee Muyeol. Please enter this way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes! Yes! I understand!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the numbers quickly progressed, the test was already nearing its end.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Our Father in heaven, merciful World Tree… I beg and beseech you. I pray, grant me the glory of becoming a Half-Elf… please, please…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re a devout believer. But it’s time to end your prayer and enter now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, yes…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The middle-aged man who had been praying fervently before the test,
 </p>
 <p>
  Continued to invoke the World Tree as he entered the tree trunk at the High Elf Priestess’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash…!
 </p>
 <p>
  As he entered, the giant tree glowed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the message window floating beside it.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Zone 1 Test Results]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Qualified: 4 Waiting: 9]
 </p>
 <p>
  So far, only 4 people had passed the aptitude test.
 </p>
 <p>
  And all those who passed were women, who had a relatively higher chance.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is it only women becoming Half-Elves again this time…
 </p>
 <p>
  -The male one that appeared three months ago seems like a miracle;
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is it true that they’ll turn off the dungeon portal suppressors if male Half-Elves don’t keep appearing?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Property values have already dropped because of that news ㅡㅡ;
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing these results, the viewers were clearly disappointed.
 </p>
 <p>
  They had hoped that with 5 men in Zone 1 this time, at least one would make it.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the atmosphere suggested that this time would be a bust too.
 </p>
 <p>
  And one minute later.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rumble…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The space in the tree trunk opened again.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, no. Why so soon…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The middle-aged man felt his ears, hoping against hope.
 </p>
 <p>
  But as he confirmed by touch that his ears were unchanged, his expression instantly hardened.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  “Ah… Can’t I have just one more chance… I’ll do better this time…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the High Elf Priestess moved her finger slightly with a cold expression,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The middle-aged man’s body flew far from inside the trunk.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh… ugh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  As he lay on the ground, groaning from the pain of the fall,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Zone 1 Test Results]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Qualified: 4 Waiting: 8]
 </p>
 <p>
  The number of waiting participants decreased by one more.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Looks like it’s a bust this time too ㅡㅡ…
 </p>
 <p>
  -No, there’s still one man left.
 </p>
 <p>
  -That person didn’t even get plastic surgery?
 </p>
 <p>
  -He should have used the signing bonus for surgery, what was he doing? No sincerity before a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Does plastic surgery even have any effect? lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -For real, isn’t it just a superstition? lol
 </p>
 <p>
  With 4 out of 5 men failing,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing that the last candidate ‘Kim Jihun’ also had very rough features,
 </p>
 <p>
  Many people were already concluding that this candidate would fail too.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, for the person in question,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘How much should I dye my hair, percentage-wise?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Becoming a Half-Elf was a given for him, but
 </p>
 <p>
  He was pondering how much to dye his hair.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They say 25 percent is the highest record. Should I exceed that or not?’
 </p>
 <p>
  If he set a new record, public attention would skyrocket.
 </p>
 <p>
  It would make it harder to quietly investigate the colonial Earth and World Tree Elves.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the other hand, if he became the most outstanding Half-Elf,
 </p>
 <p>
  There might be more chances to find out from the inside why they’re so focused on the male type.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm… should I go for 20 percent or 30 percent, that’s the question.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With his legs crossed, lost in thought, Seong Jihan,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Number 30, Player Kim Jihun. Please enter this way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Rose from his seat and walked at the High Elf Priestess’s call.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan was lost in thought, one more female Half-Elf had emerged in Zone 1.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re really done for…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I thought I’d make it…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The failed candidates hung their heads low.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sis, I knew you’d make it too!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow… I can’t believe I’ve become a Half-Elf…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The World Tree’s words… still so clear in my ears.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The five who became Half-Elves gathered together, sharing their joy.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the male type was rarer, becoming a female Half-Elf was still like winning the lottery.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this waiting room sharply divided between heaven for the qualified and hell for the failed,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I just go right in, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, the last in line, pointed at the open space in the trunk.
 </p>
 <p>
  The High Elf Priestess tilted her head at his eagerness to enter.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, but believer, aren’t you going to pray to the World Tree?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Who decided he was a believer?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought this but outwardly smiled gently.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I already did my prayers while waiting earlier.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I see. Please enter.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as the High Elf Priestess gave permission, Seong Jihan strode into the trunk.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Oh, he seems quite relaxed…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Maybe he’s just given up? lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -For real, no plastic surgery and no prayer;
 </p>
 <p>
  -Even if he succeeds, it’s a problem with so little sincerity.
 </p>
 <p>
  -He’ll probably be kicked out within a minute
 </p>
 <p>
  While most people predicted ‘Kim Jihun’s’ failure seeing him like this,
 </p>
 <p>
  As he entered the tree,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash…!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  From the giant tree,
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike before, a blue light flashed.
 </p>
 <p>
  -??
 </p>
 <p>
  -The color is different from before?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Isn’t this the light that appears when successful?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Yeah, it’s blue;;
 </p>
 <p>
  -Whoa, could it be success…?? With no preparation like that??
 </p>
 <p>
  As the chat exploded suddenly upon seeing the blue light,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, inside the tree, frowned as he saw the blue light enveloping his body.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…This is Stat Blue, isn’t it?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The power contained in that light was,
 </p>
 <p>
  The ability of the Blue Administrator, Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was ‘Blue’.

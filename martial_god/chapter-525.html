  Chapter 525
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is… what I bestowed upon humanity.’
 </p>
 <p>
  During his time as an administrator,
 </p>
 <p>
  To erase the Red factors present in all of humanity, Seong Jihan used administrator mode to universally grant Stat Blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  This use of administrator authority was possible because Blue’s grade was FFF.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since then, Blue had existed as 1 in every human’s status window.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is that what the World Tree Alliance was after?’
 </p>
 <p>
  He had wondered why they bothered making humanity a colony, but now it seems they coveted Stat Blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan’s gaze deepened,
 </p>
 <p>
  Zing…
 </p>
 <p>
  A green message window appeared before his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Player ‘Kim Jihun’ obtains Stat ‘Blue’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stat ‘Blue’ increases by 1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Class changes to ‘Blue Knight’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Blue Knight… Is this the official class name for male Half-Elves?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Male Half-Elves were known to have a unique class.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ‘Blue Knight’ class seemed to be forcibly assigned rather than chosen.
 </p>
 <p>
  As ‘Kim Jihun’s’ class changed, additional messages appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Gain 1 Stat ‘Eternity’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Blue and Eternity combine, upgrading the grade of ‘Blue’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Body undergoes changes.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Blue and Eternity are fusing…’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan widened his eyes at this message,
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud. Thud thud…
 </p>
 <p>
  His flesh twisted and then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Pop pop pop!
 </p>
 <p>
  It began to burst all at once.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Blood vessels and flesh exploded instantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The space inside the tree was quickly covered in blood and flesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Jihun’s body was soon left with only the head, and then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Pop…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Even that burst immediately.
 </p>
 <p>
  Only the brain remained.
 </p>
 <p>
  As his physical body completely disappeared,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash…!
 </p>
 <p>
  A green light rose inside the tree space,
 </p>
 <p>
  And his body slowly began to reconstruct.
 </p>
 <p>
  Into the male Half-Elf form that people so desired.
 </p>
 <p>
  And inside that body,
 </p>
 <p>
  Blue, merged with Eternity, moved actively, regenerating the body.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Blue combined with Eternity… This is quite different.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Seong Jihan had raised Stat Blue to SS rank,
 </p>
 <p>
  Blue merged with Eternity felt completely different from the Blue he had developed so far.
 </p>
 <p>
  This could be quite informative in its own way.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan tried to thoroughly analyze the Blue merged with Eternity,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stat Blue increases by 9.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stat ‘Blue’ grade rises to E.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Messages about increasing stats kept appearing.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Ah, right. I should adjust it. Soon.’
 </p>
 <p>
  At this rate, it seemed poised to absorb all the Blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  This would far surpass the current record of 25 percent.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It seems my hair color has already changed quite a bit… I should restrain myself now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Blue merged with Eternity was so intriguing that he kept accepting it,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan ended up absorbing more stats than originally planned.
 </p>
 <p>
  He decided to restrain himself now and refused the entry of more Blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  In fact, what he had gained so far was enough for researching this stat.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Hiss…
 </p>
 <p>
  Several times, blue smoke rose inside the tree space, trying to push in more Stat Blue, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I take any more, my hair will be 100 percent dyed.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan continued to completely block this,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally, the smoke gradually subsided.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  The space inside the tree slowly opened.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan stepped towards the bright gap.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A, a Half-Elf… Another one!!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “After three months…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Everyone in the waiting room stood up at once, looking at ‘Kim Jihun’ with surprised eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  And,
 </p>
 <p>
  They were soon even more surprised by Kim Jihun’s hair.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">

   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  “That, that hair color…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Could it be a new record?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems to be over 20 percent…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Part of Kim Jihun’s hair had turned sky blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  The proportion clearly looked over 1/4.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Player Kim Jihun. We will proceed with a detailed examination.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The High Elf Priestess, who had shown little interest no matter how many female Half-Elves appeared,
 </p>
 <p>
  Hurriedly approached Kim Jihun and examined him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Scan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Zing…
 </p>
 <p>
  With the High Elf Priestess’s magic, a green beam of light quickly scanned Kim Jihun’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Scan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After seeing the results, the High Elf Priestess tilted her head and used scan once more.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Comparing Kim Jihun’s hair with the scan results,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Unlike what we see, the test result is 20 percent… I see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She announced the result with a puzzled expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  -20 percent?
 </p>
 <p>
  -So it didn’t break the existing record?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Disappointing, I thought we’d see a new record from Korea;
 </p>
 <p>
  -But it clearly looks like over 1/4 is dyed…
 </p>
 <p>
  -The High Priestess’s scan should be accurate after all.
 </p>
 <p>
  -20 percent is still amazing lol Isn’t this a new record for Korean Half-Elves anyway?
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the hair dye level appearing higher, the actual scan result came out lower.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, most viewers reacted as if this was quite an achievement.
 </p>
 <p>
  20 percent was the highest among Korean male Half-Elves and ranked among the top globally.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Good thing I adjusted hastily at the end.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, Seong Jihan was satisfied with the 20 percent result.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he had absorbed more Blue earlier, he would have certainly set a new record,
 </p>
 <p>
  But it probably would have come out at least 50 percent or higher.
 </p>
 <p>
  That would have drawn too much attention.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, even this appearance will make daily life quite inconvenient.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan touched his ears.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ears that protruded like an Elf’s.
 </p>
 <p>
  Touching his face, he found that ‘Kim Jihun’s’ features, which he had made somewhat blunt,
 </p>
 <p>
  Had changed to be quite similar to Seong Jihan’s original appearance.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll need to look in a mirror later to see how I’ve changed.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was thinking this,
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The High Elf Priestess compared the scan results with Kim Jihun’s face, then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Player Kim Jihun. After the tutorial ends, come directly to the Colonial Government in Namsan. A detailed examination seems necessary.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She told him to come directly to the Colonial Government.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He was planning to go there anyway, so this worked out well.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan nodded readily, the High Elf Priestess looked around and clapped once.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, we will conclude the aptitude test for Zone 1.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Zone 1 Test Results]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Qualified: 5]
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, the test for Zone 1 ended,
 </p>
 <p>
  With 5 out of 30 passing.
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  The results of the Zone 1 aptitude test held on March 1st,
 </p>
 <p>
  Koreans focused their attention on the first appearance of a Half-Elf with 20 percent compatibility in Korea.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow, a player with over 20 percent compatibility finally appears in Korea.
 </p>
 <p>
  -I turned off BattleTube thinking this person wouldn’t make it since he didn’t prepare at all…
 </p>
 <p>
  -For real, he didn’t even get plastic surgery lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -I heard he didn’t even pre-contract with a guild, he must have hit the jackpot.
 </p>
 <p>
  -They say overseas guilds are sending negotiation teams to contract him.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Ah, why from abroad again? They already have many Half-Elves over 20 percent.
 </p>
 <p>
  -They want more… They need to look good to the Colonial Government after all.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Gun definitely needs plastic surgery lololol
 </p>
 <p>
  Player Kim Jihun, about whom the public knew nothing,DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  But once it became known through his conversation with Lee Muyeol that he wasn’t affiliated with any guild,
 </p>
 <p>
  Negotiation teams from top guilds were all moving to contact him.
 </p>
 <p>
  And,
 </p>
 <p>
  In the Guild Master’s room of the Daegi Guild,
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon narrowed her brows as she looked at Kim Jihun’s face on BattleTube.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kim Jihun… Could it be that person?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…It does seem to be the person we saw in front of the elevator last time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The ordinary-looking man that Lim Gayeong had mistaken for a paparazzi.
 </p>
 <p>
  Certainly, the man who passed the aptitude test had that face.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

 <p>
  Back then, she had told Lim Gayeong to apologize for mistaking an innocent person for paparazzi, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  “First impression, worst case… Will recruitment be difficult?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Miss, I’ll go up to that floor and kneel until that person comes out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, forget it. That person won’t come to our guild anyway.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon pointed at the 20 percent compatibility figure.
 </p>
 <p>
  “At 20 percent, even American First will come with a lot of money. How can we compete?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can’t we appeal to the advantages of the Daegi Guild?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Our advantage is just the nurturing effect… Male Half-Elves level up even without playing the game. They get huge bonuses too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Male Half-Elves received a 10x bonus by default and levelled up even while sleeping.
 </p>
 <p>
  Most of them didn’t play the game enthusiastically to level up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rumors even said they could grow just by praying to the World Tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, should we just give up?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Lee Hayeon couldn’t bring herself to answer that question and was just pressing her temples with her fingers,
 </p>
 <p>
  Knock knock.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ma, Master!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Um… Mr. Kim Jihun, who became a Half-Elf yesterday, is here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Eh, here…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, shall I show him in?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Lee Hayeon quickly nodded, the male Half-Elf entered the room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike the female type, the male type had East Asian features.
 </p>
 <p>
  They all looked similar, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ordinary people often unconsciously thought this when looking at male Half-Elves,
 </p>
 <p>
  That they vaguely resembled ‘someone’.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But compared to other Half-Elves, Kim Jihun somehow feels more… complete.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Jihun’s features were more pronounced compared to other Half-Elves.
 </p>
 <p>
  As she, who knew the previous face, looked at this face with curiosity,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hello, we’ve met before, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Jihun spoke first.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was treated as a paparazzi.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, I’m, I’m sorry.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We were very rude last time!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lim Gayeong immediately knelt beside him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Jihun waved his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, there’s no need to kneel. Instead, could you give me a ride?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A ride…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I need to go to the Colonial Government, but I’m too conspicuous.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He said, pointing at his face.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon’s eyes lit up with interest.
 </p>
 <p>
  Most people couldn’t wait to show off after becoming male Half-Elves, but this person was quite unusual.
 </p>
 <p>
  “And, while we’re at it, I’d like to hear about the Daegi Guild’s contract terms.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you… considering joining our guild?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I used to be a fan of this guild.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A fan?
 </p>
 <p>
  Blinking at the unexpected answer, Lee Hayeon was at a loss for words.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, since I’m here, could I take a tour of the guild?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A tour… Yes, yes! I’ll guide you myself.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon stood up herself to show Kim Jihun around the guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That person… Is he really the one who passed the aptitude test yesterday?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Wow, I thought he definitely wouldn’t come here…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “From what I heard earlier, he came on his own?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Huh? Why on earth?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Our guild can’t afford him.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Lee Hayeon personally guided Kim Jihun,
 </p>
 <p>
  The guild employees watched from afar, whispering in confusion.
 </p>
 <p>
  Given the Daegi Guild’s poor situation, it would be difficult to match the contract terms for a Half-Elf with 20 percent compatibility.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Maybe it’s because my ears have grown longer, but I can hear everything.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Tap. Tap.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Jihun pointed at his ears while looking at them.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Everyone, return to your positions.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lim Gayeong approached the onlookers with a stern face and dispersed them.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The guild employees have become lax compared to before. They don’t seem to have much work either.’
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan was active, the Daegi Guild attracted only the best talent, even for the working staff.
 </p>
 <p>
  The guild five years later clearly didn’t have the same quality of human resources as before.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Actually, if it weren’t for the guild certification, they wouldn’t be this financially strained.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He wondered why they needed to do the certification, he should take a look.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, inside Kim Jihun’s shell, removed the Sacred Flame from only his left eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do you want to return to the Guild Owner’s position?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The guild certification process will be completed when you authenticate the guild’s symbol flag, the ‘Red Cloud Phoenix Flag’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The cost for maintaining the guild buff effect will disappear.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A message appeared saying that the guild certification process would be completed if he brought out the Phoenix Flag.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Phoenix Spear, which was once almost synonymous with Seong Jihan, though he rarely used it later.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the message to bring it out, Seong Jihan’s gaze slightly lowered.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This won’t do.’

  Chapter 526
 </p>
 <p>
  What was needed to complete the guild certification process was the return of the Daegi Guild’s owner.
 </p>
 <p>
  This would be nothing short of a signal announcing Seong Jihan’s return.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the current declining situation of the guild was regrettable,
 </p>
 <p>
  If he intervened here, it would negate the purpose of using Sacred Flame.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Instead, I’ll have to help indirectly through Kim Jihun’s body.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As for the contract terms, he just needed to make them look reasonable.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking this, Seong Jihan received the full guild tour from Lee Hayeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It seems there are still quite a few players renting for growth. Why has it fallen so much?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Daegi Guild, which once swept up money from around the world during its peak,
 </p>
 <p>
  Even now, judging from the atmosphere during the tour, there were quite a few players renting for growth.
 </p>
 <p>
  If they were receiving money from them, even in the era of Half-Elves,
 </p>
 <p>
  They should have been able to recruit with that capital.
 </p>
 <p>
  Holding such doubts while observing the guild, Seong Jihan,
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is the space used as the guild warehouse… Would you like to go in here too?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Warehouse?”CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the room Lee Hayeon pointed to, his eyes sparkled.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This… was definitely the space prepared as the owner’s room before.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who founded the Daegi Guild but rarely visited the guild building,
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, as the owner, Lee Hayeon had prepared the best room in the Daegi Guild for him.
 </p>
 <p>
  But now it had been changed to a warehouse.
 </p>
 <p>
  “May I take a look?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Beep.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Lee Hayeon swiped her card, the door opened.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan followed her into the owner’s room turned warehouse.
 </p>
 <p>
  And there,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…What’s this?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The walls were densely covered with posters showing Seong Jihan’s face.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Record erasure is unacceptable.
 </p>
 <p>
  -After being treated like that by the World Tree Elves, you still trust them?
 </p>
 <p>
  -He will surely return.
 </p>
 <p>
  And below the photos, large letters were written.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were more posters in foreign languages than in Korean.
 </p>
 <p>
  All of them with phrases opposing Seong Jihan’s record erasure.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘At that time, did the Daegi Guild work from an opposing stance?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Feeling a strange emotion, Seong Jihan quickly glanced around the interior.
 </p>
 <p>
  Documents scattered messily on the floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  One document detailed the advertising budget spent on rejecting Yggdrasil’s proposal.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So this is where all the money went…’
 </p>
 <p>
  They had spent all their money on a public opinion battle to prevent Seong Jihan’s record erasure.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he stared blankly at the papers on the floor,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, perhaps those letters… do you know what they mean?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You mean what’s written on this paper?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, you were looking intently at the undecipherable letters.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan picked up a piece of paper from the side.
 </p>
 <p>
  American First’s rental contract withdrawal document.
 </p>
 <p>
  He quietly looked at the content showing how they had clashed with the American stance of needing to survive first, leading to contract termination, then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Slowly shook his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No. I don’t know this either.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… I see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “More importantly, what’s with that whiskey over there?”
 </p>
 <p>
  In the middle of the warehouse,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan pointed at a half-empty bottle of whiskey and some snack bags.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh no… again…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lim Gayeong, seeing this, sighed deeply and bowed her head to Lee Hayeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m sorry! Miss. Despite there being many bars in this building, I came to drink in this empty warehouse! I didn’t clean up properly!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, my… Is, is that so? Don’t do it again next time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Lee Hayeon, her face bright red, waved her hands saying it was okay,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you so, so much for forgiving me!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lim Gayeong emphasized ‘so much’ with a face that didn’t look sorry at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  This clearly looked like she was taking the blame for what Lee Hayeon drank.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But why drink in the warehouse?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan briefly wondered about this, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Th-Then… shall we leave now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Lee Hayeon hurriedly suggested leaving, he nodded readily.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was nothing more to see in the warehouse anyway.
 </p>
 <p>
  After leaving the room, Seong Jihan spoke up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The guild is nice.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Th-Thank you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. I especially like the growth rate increase option. While I go to the Colonial Government, could you let me know about the contract terms?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon blinked at those words.
 </p>
 <p>
  For male Half-Elves, the growth rate increase was honestly an unnecessary option.
 </p>
 <p>
  He liked this?
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  ‘…He didn’t get plastic surgery before the test either. Does he actually not know much about this?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon couldn’t help but think this.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, alright.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now I’d like to go to the Colonial Government.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, then I’ll call the driver right away…”
 </p>
 <p>
  She was about to call for a driver but changed her mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, we’ll take you ourselves.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Guild Master herself?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, of course we should do that for such an esteemed guest.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Was she worried he might get scouted by other guilds at the Colonial Government?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘She seems quite desperate.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, he had no intention of going anywhere else anyway.
 </p>
 <p>
  If Lee Hayeon was marking him, other guilds wouldn’t rashly come to make offers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan slowly nodded at her suggestion.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright. Let’s do that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Let’s go, Gayeong.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, I’ll prepare right away.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The three of them went to the parking lot,
 </p>
 <p>
  Got into a luxury sedan, and headed to the Colonial Government in Namsan.
 </p>
 <p>
  And in the car on the way to their destination, after conversing with Kim Jihun, Lee Hayeon thought,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This person isn’t ignorant of the world. Rather… he seems to know everything.’
 </p>
 <p>
  She instinctively felt that Kim Jihun was not someone to be taken lightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  If she tried any tricks against him, it would ruin everything.
 </p>
 <p>
  With her experience of meeting many people in the industry, she judged this and,
 </p>
 <p>
  “…So actually, male Half-Elves are passive about game play. They level up just by sleeping.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You mean…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Our guild’s growth rate increase characteristic might not have much effect for Half-Elves.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She spoke honestly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I know that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, it’s a fact you can find with a quick internet search.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then why…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have some fan sentiment. And there are some things I want to test regarding growth rate.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah…”
 </p>
 <p>
  So he came knowing everything.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon felt relieved at this answer.
 </p>
 <p>
  This meant he was likely to choose the Daegi Guild regardless.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ve arrived.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Screech.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the car parked, Kim Jihun spoke while getting out of his seat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just match the contract terms moderately. Then we can proceed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… Yes! Then we’ll wait here!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You don’t know how long the detailed examination will take.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll wait even if it takes days!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Jihun chuckled at Lee Hayeon’s enthusiastic response.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright. I’ll be back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Kim Jihun entered the Colonial Government,
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon pinched her own cheek.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this… reality?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It feels like a dream to me too, Miss. A male Half-Elf who knows everything is coming to join our guild.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even though he said that, we should try to get the best contract terms possible, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Even our best offer would be ‘moderate’ by other guilds’ standards.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s true.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  A male Half-Elf with 20 percent compatibility would be recruited with blank checks anywhere.
 </p>
 <p>
  For the financially struggling Daegi Guild, even their best offer would be below average compared to others.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Let’s try our best to get the most we can.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon pondered seriously about the contract terms to offer when Kim Jihun returned.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, in Kim Jihun’s shell, entered the Colonial Government.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This way, please.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Guided by an elf, he stood before the World Tree-shaped Colonial Government.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  The giant tree, showing an even more overwhelming presence than the former Namsan Tower,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the World Tree Elves’ Colonial Government, Seong Jihan thought,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This… is a World Tree? And quite a high-grade one at that.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to the World Trees he had seen before, this Colonial Government was definitely larger in scale.
 </p>
 <p>
  Judging from the overwhelming life force flowing from it, it seemed Yggdrasil had put considerable effort into it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But how do I get in?’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was looking at the Colonial Government like this,
 </p>
 <p>
  “We will now begin the detailed examination.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Green light flashed from the body of the Elf High Priest who had come to greet him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Rumble…
 </p>
 <p>
  From beneath Seong Jihan’s feet, roots imbued with green light rose up and began to envelop his body.
 </p>
 <p>
  Squeeze.
 </p>
 <p>
  And when the roots completely wrapped around Seong Jihan’s body,
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  The Elf High Priest, watching this, calmly continued speaking.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Relax and calmly accept the World Tree’s energy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  The roots began to glow.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan relaxed as instructed,
 </p>
 <p>
  Rumble…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The roots pulled him underground.
 </p>
 <p>
  After moving like this for a few minutes,
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud…
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Jihun’s body dropped into a dark space.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mmm…”
 </p>
 <p>
  To not appear too nonchalant,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan let out an appropriate groan as he got up.
 </p>
 <p>
  And as he was about to survey his surroundings,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Green letters began to appear inside the space he had fallen into.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Detailed examination begins.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Testing Blue absorption capacity.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Re-examining Blue Sword compatibility. Currently 20 percent.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Text in the World Tree Elves’ script, unreadable to humans.
 </p>
 <p>
  But Seong Jihan, who had also obtained the Red authority, could interpret these letters.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I understand the detailed examination and absorption capacity… but what’s Blue Sword?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking at the 20 percent compatibility,
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the same as the male Half-Elf figure.
 </p>
 <p>
  Could it be that they refer to male Half-Elves as Blue Swords?
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was thinking this,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside this space,
 </p>
 <p>
  Blue smoke began to rise.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is… modified Blue.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Smoke made to be absorbable just by breathing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Were they testing how much of this one can make their own?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Deviating too much from the average would raise suspicion.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking this, Seong Jihan decided not to intervene at all from within Kim Jihun’s body and waited.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish swish…
 </p>
 <p>
  The Blue that seeped in through the nose, mouth, and even the skin slowly entered Kim Jihun’s body, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  It leaked out again.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Without my intervention, it’s clearly not being absorbed.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, Kim Jihun’s shell rejected the Blue, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  As if this one time wasn’t enough for the test, blue smoke was emitted again.
 </p>
 <p>
  This looked like it would take quite some time to finish.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should look around inside during this time.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, observing from inside the shell,
 </p>
 <p>
  Completely hiding the presence of the Blue Administrator, he slowly began to examine the interior of this World Tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  From quite a distant place, he could hear the voices of elves.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…We thought an unusual case had appeared, but this Blue Knight seems no different from the others.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Still, proceed with the detailed examination as planned.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How far have the World Tree’s roots spread?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They’ve taken over 82 percent of this planet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It will take about a year to reach 100 percent.”
 </p>
 <p>
  High Elf Priestesses discussing while observing Kim Jihun’s test results.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among them, the High Elf Priest in the center, with blonde hair and quite a bit of green hair visible, seemed to be quite high-ranking.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yggdrasil said to change the system if the Blue Sword compatibility doesn’t improve further within a year.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “By system change, you mean…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If 25 percent is the limit for compatibility that can be drawn out through a peaceful system.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Grin.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Elf High Priest raised the corner of their mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll have to instill fear in them through oppression.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Finally, permission for slaughter…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, your involvement will be the final stage.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… I understand.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The High Elf Priestesses showed clear disappointment at the high-ranking priest’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan watched this and thought,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘As expected of these Elf bastards. I wondered why they were ruling peacefully, but their true nature hasn’t gone anywhere.’
 </p>
 <p>
  At first, they ruled peacefully to try and draw out compatibility.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the score didn’t improve further, they wouldn’t switch the ruling system to explore a new direction.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was eavesdropping on their plans like this,
 </p>
 <p>
  “We must complete the Blue Sword before the Red Administrator awakens. Since the intended owner of the Arena is absent, check the sealing site as well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The high-ranking priest was instructing the elves to examine Washington while Yoon Seah was away.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Why is the Red Administrator coming up here? These bastards. Could it be they’ve predicted that the Red Administrator would eventually win in Washington?’
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed that the Green Administrator thought Seong Jihan would lose in HeavenNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan briefly felt displeased at the thought that Yggdrasil had underestimated him, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That misunderstanding… I should use it to my advantage.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon, he came up with a way to exploit this situation.

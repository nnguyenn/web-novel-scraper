  Chapter 527
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If you’re so worried about Red, you should show it in reality.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who gained Red’s power in the process of becoming the owner of HeavenNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  As long as he had enough Red stat, he could imitate the ‘Red Administrator’ as much as he wanted.
 </p>
 <p>
  And.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can keep gaining Red as long as I offer sacrifices to Hell with blue and red.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Right now, he had used up a lot of ability creating a new profile called ‘Kim Jihun’, so he didn’t have much Red.
 </p>
 <p>
  But this stat could be extracted infinitely just by putting living beings into Hell.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Of course, if I keep gaining Red, the seal on Blue and Red might break. I’ll have to control it properly.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Currently, Seong Jihan’s Blue stat was 999.
 </p>
 <p>
  As long as Red didn’t exceed this number, he could control it.
 </p>
 <p>
  But if he got too absorbed in gaining Red through Hell and accidentally exceeded 999, the seal on Blue and Red might break.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Red value I can perfectly control is about 700… I should only absorb that much from Blue and Red.’
 </p>
 <p>
  So, now the problem was.
 </p>
 <p>
  He needed sacrifices to put into Hell.
 </p>
 <p>
  Actually, the most efficient thing for the Hell was ‘humanity’, where the Red Administrator had resided.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I don’t intend to do human sacrifices. A being rich in life force… Ah. I can use the World Tree.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The World Tree Alliance, which has established forces throughout the universe.
 </p>
 <p>
  The planets where they planted World Trees were countless.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The coordinates of planets belonging to the World Tree Alliance… I could quickly find them by searching the BattleNet community.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The BattleNet community, which only players above a certain level could use.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan used to use it often before, but now he had no access rights as he was expelled by BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But if I use Red’s power, I can get temporary access.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator, who was good at everything except fighting.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially, he was exceptionally good at distorting and infiltrating existing system.
 </p>
 <p>
  He could easily enter something like the BattleNet community using his power.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I terrorize them as the Red Administrator like that, they’ll feel more need for the Blue stat.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If the Red Administrator they were so worried about was revived.
 </p>
 <p>
  They would invest more resources here to complete the Blue Sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll take that.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recalled the current value of his Blue stat.
 </p>
 <p>
  Blue: 999 (When rising to SSS rank, +1731)
 </p>
 <p>
  Blue, which didn’t increase beyond 999 as it was currently staying at SS rank.
 </p>
 <p>
  He believed that the Blue Sword created by the World Tree Alliance would be the key to raising Blue’s rank.
 </p>
 <p>
  And for good reason.
 </p>
 <p>
  Blue combined with eternity was certainly different from the Blue that Seong Jihan had been developing so far.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he absorbed Blue developed through a different route, the rank stuck at SS would rise.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Plus, if Blue’s rank rises, I can use more Red.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Blue that controls Red.
 </p>
 <p>
  If this stat jumped up significantly, the amount of Red that can be absorbed from Hell would increase as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then he’d become several times stronger than now.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘With that level of power, I should be able to subdue Yggdrasil for sure.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Yggdrasil, the Green Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  She, who had established the greatest force in BattleNet except for the Black and White Administrators,
 </p>
 <p>
  Was certainly not an opponent to be taken lightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can keep supplying Red stat by just burning World Trees, so I’ll use that to weaken the World Tree Alliance’s forces.’
 </p>
 <p>
  When the Blue Sword would be completed, he would use it to raise Blue to SSS rank.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then use Blue and Red to cut down the World Tree, which should finish the opponent.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Alright. I’ll go with that plan for now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  After making such plans, Seong Jihan turned his gaze to ‘Kim Jihun’, who was enveloped in blue smoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What’s needed in the process of making the Blue Sword is probably a Half-Elf with high compatibility.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Then Kim Jihun shouldn’t be satisfied with just 20 percent now.
 </p>
 <p>
  If Half-Elves become materials for making the Blue Sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Jihun should definitely be included in that.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well then, shall we grow him a bit?’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan made up his mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  The blue light smoke that was being emitted started to be absorbed into Kim Jihun little by little.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Detailed inspection value change.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Blue acceptance inspection.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Blue Sword compatibility re-inspection. Currently 22 percent……]
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, the compatibility that jumped up 2 percent in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, no……”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The subject’s compatibility suddenly jumped up!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How much did it rise?”
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  “It, it rose by 2 percent!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “2 percent……”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Kim Jihun’s rapid growth, the Elf high priest opened his eyes wide.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……We need to continue the detailed inspection.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Should we bring in spare ‘Blue’ from other departments?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Elves started contacting somewhere, moving busily.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Blue…… You don’t have any spare there either?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We used up all the amount extracted from humans in this aptitude test……”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah. The, there’s a little left in the eastern region!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Explain the situation and bring it in.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He didn’t know how they extracted Blue from humans.
 </p>
 <p>
  But it seemed they were not very abundant in resources either.
 </p>
 <p>
  After the Elves of the Colonial Government ran around busily watching Kim Jihun’s growth,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh……!
 </p>
 <p>
  Blue smoke started to be thickly sprayed again in the space where Kim Jihun’s body was.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was about to absorb this more into Kim Jihun’s shell, but changed his mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Instead of absorbing it into the shell, I should eat it myself.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If Kim Jihun too easily surpasses 50 percent, cases like these Elves voluntarily offering Blue might disappear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Plus.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to collect the Blue I sprayed on humanity using these guys.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who added Blue using administrator authority to save humanity from the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  But what such humanity chose in their final moment was Seong Jihan’s record erasure.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, it was an inevitable choice to survive, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Now that even the Red Administrator is gone. There’s no need for my ability to be in humanity.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan didn’t feel the need to leave Blue for such humanity either.
 </p>
 <p>
  He should start the recovery process while snatching what the World Tree Elves are collecting like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sssss……
 </p>
 <p>
  Blue smoke entered Kim Jihun’s shell.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Blue stat increases by 11.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Blue is 999. Stat no longer increases.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [When Blue’s rank rises to SSS, the excess increase will be reflected.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This isn’t much when converted to stats.’
 </p>
 <p>
  After absorbing about half of the blue mist like that, Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Blue is rapidly disappearing……!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Asura]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Could the compatibility be rising again?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is the first time I’ve seen such a case……”
 </p>
 <p>
  When the World Tree Elves made a fuss, he stopped leeching at this point.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That’s it for today.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As he made up his mind, Kim Jihun’s compatibility, which only had smoke rising thickly and didn’t move at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……Clearly, more than half of the Blue disappeared.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this the limit?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But earlier too, the value didn’t change and then suddenly jumped up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s keep watching for a while.”
 </p>
 <p>
  While the Elves watched Kim Jihun and discussed like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The absorption is over, but it doesn’t seem like they’ll release me right away.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who obtained Blue, decided to utilize the remaining time.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should look at the BattleNet community in the meantime.’
 </p>
 <p>
  When the Elves’ attention was focused on Kim Jihun.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan accessed the BattleNet community from inside that shell.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  The official member board of the BattleNet community, which only those above Constellation candidate could enter.
 </p>
 <p>
  [40 Red stat is consumed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who entered here using Red, thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s right there in the announcement.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan inwardly chuckled as he saw the top notice on the board.
 </p>
 <p>
  -World Tree Alliance Territory (Latest Update – Humanity Added Version)
 </p>
 <p>
  It had been several years since humanity became a colony, and this was still the latest update version?
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan clicked on that post,
 </p>
 <p>
  Coordinates for over hundreds of planets popped up.
 </p>
 <p>
  And at the very bottom,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That’s Earth’s coordinates.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The planet coordinates of Earth, fully disclosed after humanity became a colony of the World Tree Alliance.
 </p>
 <p>
  [As there are many undisclosed territories of the World Tree Alliance, official members should first check for the presence of World Trees when invading other planets. You might accidentally invade their territory and lose your home planet to the Alliance as a result.]𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  At the end of the post was a warning not to invade World Tree Alliance territory.
 </p>
 <p>
  └ Thanks for the update. Places to expand our forces are disappearing…

  └ Those Alliance bastards take all the best lands.

 <p>
  └ The rich get richer, seriously.
 </p>
 <p>
  └ Why doesn’t the World Tree Alliance get any sanctions… What’s the system doing?
 </p>
 <p>
  └ But why did humanity become a colony? Doesn’t the Alliance’s style usually involve wiping out indigenous species and starting from scratch?
 </p>
 <p>
  └ Probably trying to leech off the Blue Administrator’s legacy.
 </p>
 <p>
  └ Is there anything left to eat even though that administrator was expelled?
 </p>
 <p>
  └ It was a huge topic once, right? I would’ve already visited Earth if the World Tree Alliance hadn’t intervened.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘These guys remember me?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, it was humanity that suffered Seong Jihan’s record erasure, not the alien Constellation candidates.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who once recorded the highest views on BattleTube,
 </p>
 <p>
  Even after several years, there were quite a few who remembered him.
 </p>
 <p>
  After saving the World Tree Alliance coordinates from the post, Seong Jihan,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, let’s search for the Blue Administrator.’
 </p>
 <p>
  While at it, he also searched for his own name.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Are there any other players who went bankrupt because of the Blue Administrator?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Sigh…
 </p>
 <p>
  └ I hit the jackpot betting on the Blue Administrator, then kept betting on low-rank species players and lost all my GP.
 </p>
 <p>
  └ Blue was a special case, but most follow their species rank…
 </p>
 <p>
  └ This time I bet everything on a promising Dwarf and lost all my assets, so I’m off to work as a mercenary…
 </p>
 <p>
  └ I want to be comforted by fools like me.

 <p>
  └ You messed up from your own greed and now what lol
 </p>
 <p>
  └ Blue was an irregular. Such cases might happen once in a thousand years.
 </p>
 <p>
  └ What thousand years, there’s never been such a case in BattleNet history?
 </p>
 <p>
  └ Why was he expelled though?
 </p>
 <p>
  └ Don’t know the exact reason, but they say Blue colluded with the Red Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  └ Really? When I watched BattleTube, it looked like he went to kill Red…
 </p>
 <p>
  Posts from players who couldn’t forget the taste of hitting it big betting on Seong Jihan, and then kept betting on low-rank species and lost everything, started showing up in the search results.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So I was expelled for colluding with the Red Administrator…’
 </p>
 <p>
  And that reason came from ‘BattleTube’, which was under the White Administrator’s jurisdiction.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It seems my expulsion is related to White as well.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The temporary administrator Green didn’t have the authority to expel him system-wise.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed only a permanent administrator like White would be able to expel him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I guess I shouldn’t turn on BattleTube when attacking the World Tree Alliance.’
 </p>
 <p>
  After all, BattleTube acted as the eyes and ears of the White Administrator.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to terrorize the World Tree Alliance as inconspicuously as possible until he could grasp White’s movements.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he was gathering necessary information through the community,
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s no further progress.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems we should end it here for today.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood. Let’s end the examination of player ‘Kim Jihun’ here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When there was no notable change in Kim Jihun even after a long time,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  Huge roots wrapped around his body again.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s over.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  The roots dropped the unconscious body in front of the Colonial Government.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  An Elf appeared beside Kim Jihun.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not the Elf who initially guided him, but a high priestess with green hair.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Player Kim Jihun, wake up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She kicked Kim Jihun lightly, then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzzt……!
 </p>
 <p>
  When he didn’t wake up, she gave his body a light electric shock.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh……!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Jihun woke up with a start.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is the first time I’ve seen someone fall asleep during a detailed examination.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m, I’m sorry… I suddenly lost consciousness…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You lost consciousness without realizing it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes…”
 </p>
 <p>
  As he bowed his head apologetically,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Elf high priestess gazed at him with sunken eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That might be related to the rise in compatibility.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Um… What do you mean by that…”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Kim Jihun opened his eyes wide in disbelief at those words,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Congratulations.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She continued speaking calmly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “As a result of the detailed examination, you have been designated as a ‘special management target’ of the Colonial Government.”

  Chapter 528
 </p>
 <p>
  “Special management target……”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re the first case where compatibility increased during the detailed examination.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “My compatibility increased?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. So now, on the 1st day of every month, you need to come to the Colonial Government.“
 </p>
 <p>
  As the High Priestess said so, she extended her finger towards Kim Jihun’s chest.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash…!
 </p>
 <p>
  A green light extended and entered Kim Jihun’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You are imprinted with the Seal of the World Tree.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is this……”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a ‘blessing’ given to special management targets. You might feel ill for a few days, but endure it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, understood!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, I’ll see you next month on the 1st.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whizz…!
 </p>
 <p>
  With those final words, the High Priestess disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  As she vanished, green light began to radiate out from Kim Jihun’s chest.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh… I feel dizzy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Alongside this, his body grew limp.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as the High Priestess warned he might feel ill for a few days, his body did not cooperate well.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Kim Jihun slumped to the ground and staggered,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you alright?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The group that had been waiting, including Lee Hayeon, rushed out of the car and quickly supported him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I, I’ll just rest for a moment……”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, just close your eyes for a bit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though Kim Jihun’s body had transformed into that of a Half-Elf, the fatigue was overwhelming.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather than resisting, Seong Jihan decided to let the shell sleep, matching the situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Kim Jihun fell asleep in an instant,
 </p>
 <p>
  “What happened exactly……?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Earlier, the Elf High Priestess did mention he was a special management target.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did something come up during the detailed examination?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It appears so……”
 </p>
 <p>
  “For now, let’s drive slowly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Checking his condition, Lee Hayeon and Lim Gayeong conversed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Seal of the World Tree. The seal is still being engraved on the chest, so no effects are apparent yet, but… it looks like it will take a few days to complete.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The faint green light seeping from his chest was slowly engraving the seal onto Kim Jihun’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  Until it was completed, Kim Jihun’s condition would likely remain poor.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Then, this is the perfect time to initiate a terror attack.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The ‘Kim Jihun’ created by Sacred Flame could exist separately.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, if Seong Jihan left, it would just be an unconscious flesh shell.
 </p>
 <p>
  But in the current state, with the World Tree Seal being implanted and Kim Jihun asleep,
 </p>
 <p>
  It should be fine even if the shell stayed in bed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ve arrived, Mr. Kim Jihun.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh, uh……”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you feeling better? We’ll help you to your home.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m… really sorry, but could you help?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Completely limp, supported by the two people up to his doorstep, Kim Jihun finally spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Ah… this place. It used to be Sophia’s.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon entering his place, Lee Hayeon was slightly surprised internally.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So, it’s up for rent…? Well, there’s no way Sophia would come back to Korea.’
 </p>
 <p>
  She accepted it internally and laid Kim Jihun on the bed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mr. Kim Jihun, I’ve left my number here. Please call if anything happens.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you… so much……”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thunk!
 </p>
 <p>
  With those final words, he collapsed into a deep sleep on the bed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What in the world did the Elf do for him to end up like this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I heard it was a blessing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re so lucky to hear everything from a distance, Gayeong.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, that’s why I’m on the national team, isn’t it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seriously, players are the best. Alright, let’s go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Lee Hayeon and Lim Gayeong left swiftly,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Alright, let’s go.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In a swirl…
 </p>
 <p>
  Blue smoke briefly rose from Kim Jihun’s body, further weakening it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan floated above his body.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s start here.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He selected one of the planet coordinates he saw on the community.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Even though I could use Mind Creates All for spatial travel…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Mind Creates All allowed moving through space via the sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, it would leave traces in the surroundings.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since he needed to act discreetly now,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll use Red’s power to open a portal.’

 <p>
  The Red Administrator, exceptional at everything except combat.
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed, his powers were extremely useful in daily life.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle…
 </p>
 <p>
  As electricity sparked in the air, a small red portal formed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan entered it.
 </p>
 <p>
  When he emerged on the other side of the portal,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I got it right.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In the vast space of the universe, a planet lay beneath him.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  The World Tree Elf’s planet.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though smaller than Earth, it was still enormous for one person to take down.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Anyway, my target is the World Tree.’
 </p>
 <p>
  At times like this, having a clear target was beneficial.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan scanned the planet.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The World Tree is… over there.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Finding the spot with the most concentrated life force,
 </p>
 <p>
  He immediately moved towards it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Tap.
 </p>
 <p>
  Breaking through the atmosphere in an instant, Seong Jihan landed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Compared to the World Tree at Namsan, this one is only 1/5th the size.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He stood before the World Tree of this planet with a composed face.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the tree was overwhelmingly large,
 </p>
 <p>
  Its scale and life force were inferior to the World Tree at Namsan’s Colonial Government.
 </p>
 <p>
  This revealed how much effort the World Tree Alliance had put into Earth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What about the Bronze League species this time?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nothing special. Followed the manual, executed them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just another unusual case like that ‘humanity’ one.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Elves, all looking alike, gathered discussing Space League games within the Bronze League.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So, this planet is in the Bronze League. Talking about player executions like that.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A method previously attempted on humanity but failed.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seems they were still using it elsewhere successfully.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That strange case species, Yggdrasil graciously designated them as a colony, didn’t she?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I wanted to be dispatched there, but too many senior candidates applied, so I failed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m envious. Could have directly dealt with those disgraceful humans.”
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>

  [Proofreader – Gun]
 </p>
 <p>
  “When they’re culling humanity, they might recruit an extermination squad. Try applying again then. I’m sure you’ll make it, sister.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Elves cheerfully discussed the execution plans related to humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although some glanced in Seong Jihan’s direction,
 </p>
 <p>
  None of them noticed his presence.
 </p>
 <p>
  Due to the overwhelming domain of Blue combined with Martial Soul,
 </p>
 <p>
  The moment Seong Jihan decided to hide his presence,
 </p>
 <p>
  Neither the elves nor the World Tree could perceive him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If the elves here talk like this, the culling of humanity is probably planned after extracting Blue.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  No more reason to hesitate in cutting down the World Tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s proceed.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In a swirl…
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan expanded the Blue domain significantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Over several kilometers of space surrounding the World Tree fell entirely under his control.
 </p>
 <p>
  None of the elves sensed anything amiss.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s tidy up.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A light tap on the ground from Seong Jihan’s foot.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  The ground trembled lightly.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Pop! Pop! Pop!
 </p>
 <p>
  The elves near the World Tree simultaneously blew up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Without knowing what happened,
 </p>
 <p>
  Their bodies exploded while still smiling.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Their bodies were torn into tiny pieces and burned, leaving no trace.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a single light tap, all the elf players were annihilated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan turned his gaze to the World Tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I shouldn’t destroy this using Blue’s power.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In a swirl…
 </p>
 <p>
  the Blue and Red Sword appeared in the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan embedded it into the World Tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sword smoothly embedded itself.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s the first time I’m offering a World Tree, better start with a small crack.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As it was the first sacrifice, Seong Jihan slightly loosened the seal on Blue and red.
 </p>
 <p>
  A tiny part of the blue aura around Blue and Red turned red.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the red point glistened,
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Whoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The enormous World Tree was sucked into Blue and Red in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘D-grade World Tree’ absorbed by Hell.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Absorption efficiency greatly reduced by Blue.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Red stat increased by 200.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A red message window appeared in front of Seong Jihan’s eyes,
 </p>
 <p>
  Informing him of the 200 stat increase in Red.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Opening only this small space increased the Red stat by 200.’
 </p>
 <p>
  By opening a mere point-sized crack,
 </p>
 <p>
  The World Tree was swiftly absorbed, raising the Red stat by 200.
 </p>
 <p>
  Had the target been higher-grade or the crack slightly larger,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red stat might have reached the 700 cap instantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to be careful with this, better make it smaller.’
 </p>
 <p>
  After resealing Blue and Red, Seong Jihan surveyed the surroundings.
 </p>
 <p>
  The completely vanished World Tree and the annihilated elves.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Thanks to Blue and Red’s clean absorption, no trace of me remains.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seems like a perfect crime.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s visit a few more places.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle…
 </p>
 <p>
  A red portal opened in the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s body moved towards the next World Tree Elf’s planet.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  The 4th planet of the World Tree Alliance.
 </p>
 <p>
  This place differed from the previous ones.
 </p>
 <p>
  Numerous High Elves, having some green in their hair, were standing near the World Tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The World Tree here is quite large, almost half the size of the one at Namsan.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The World Tree showcased a significant scale.
 </p>
 <p>
  Given its size, it might offer some resistance compared to previous planets.
 </p>
 <p>
  But,
 </p>
 <p>
  In a swirl…
 </p>
 <p>
  Until Blue’s domain expanded completely.
 </p>
 <p>
  The elves, just like before, didn’t notice a thing.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Even High Elves can be handled with Blue’s domain.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A light tap on the ground from Seong Jihan’s foot.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hm…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Some High Elves sensed something was wrong.
 </p>
 <p>
  Blaze…!
 </p>
 <p>
  But before they could resist, the surrounding elves exploded simultaneously.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s happening…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Although some High Elves tried to regenerate their bodies quickly after exploding,
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The burned fragments of their bodies failed to regenerate further.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is absurd.’
 </p>
 <p>
  They’re too easy.
 </p>
 <p>
  After cleaning up the surroundings, Seong Jihan approached the World Tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  When he embedded Blue and Red,
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘B-grade World Tree’ absorbed by the Hell.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Absorption efficiency greatly reduced by Blue.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Red stat increased by 250.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The enormous World Tree got sucked into the sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  A red message window appeared in front of his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite loosening Blue and Red’s seal even lesser than before, the Red stat increased.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It was a B-grade. No wonder it felt larger.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Though not as large as Namsan’s, the B-grade World Tree’s life force was significantly stronger than a D-grade one.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s why there were many High Elves capable of regeneration even after bursting.
 </p>
 <p>
  Higher-ranked targets might offer resistance, eventually.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Should I look for an A-grade…”
 </p>
 <p>
  A planet from the World Tree Alliance utterly devastated by the mere extension of Blue’s domain.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since no real battle had taken place, Seong Jihan felt unsatisfied.
 </p>
 <p>
  He needed to act discreetly, but it was too easy.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As he was looking through the saved coordinates from the BattleNet community,
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash…!
 </p>
 <p>
  From within Blue and Red, a red light flashed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Blue one, I’d recommend stopping here today.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A red eye appeared at the center.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Absorbing more Red might create gaps in Blue and Red. That could break the seal.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The red eye gazed at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  He knew well the identity of that eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Wouldn’t that be good for you, Red Administrator?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [No.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Twitch.
 </p>
 <p>
  The red eye at the center of Blue and Red shifted slightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ‘Red Administrator’ responded to Seong Jihan’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I like it here.]

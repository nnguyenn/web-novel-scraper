  Chapter 529
 </p>
 <p>
  “You say it’s nice in there?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan questioned, as if he couldn’t understand.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Hell, extremely compressed and sealed inside the sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  What could be nice about being trapped in there?
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. There’s already a completed Hell here, so why would I go outside? If I went out, I’d just be caught by the White Administrator and have to rebuild HeavenNet from scratch.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, you’ll stay trapped?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Besides, if I want to watch you become the permanent administrator of HeavenNet, it’s better to stay here.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Permanent administrator… You think I’ll do that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Already, haven’t you used my powers this much?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoosh…
 </p>
 <p>
  Flames sparked above the red eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  What was revealed there was the World Tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Thanks to them, from the moment you started using Red to deal with enemies, I was certain. It’s only a matter of time before you become the permanent administrator of HeavenNet. Because you’ll keep using Red.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, Red’s powers are quite useful.”
 </p>
 <p>
  They say it was good at everything except combat.
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed, most powers used in daily life were Red’s.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan readily acknowledged Red’s usefulness,
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’ve realized the convenience too quickly. Blue one. Accept it more slowly. It’s not time yet.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead, the other side restrained him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I just said your abilities are useful, that’s all.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The problem is your attitude that’s already turned positive. You should be more wary and show hostility for a while longer. Otherwise, you might be consumed by Red.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Wouldn’t that be good for you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [No. I want the master of HeavenNet to be more complete.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Sssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  As he said this, the image illuminated by the flames
 </p>
 <p>
  Changed from the World Tree to a blue sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Blue Sword that the World Tree Alliance is making… Obtain this and strengthen your powers.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I didn’t expect you to tell me to get that. If Blue’s power gets stronger, it could completely annihilate the sealed Hell, you know.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That may be so. However.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Pop!
 </p>
 <p>
  The flames disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  The red eye slowly began to shrink.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You will eventually become the administrator of HeavenNet.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re too certain.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Because if Red disappears, you’ll be too uncomfortable to bear it. Blue’s power is specialized for combat only, isn’t it?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, I originally lived fine without it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [But once convenience arises, it’s hard to give up. Like this.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as he finished speaking,
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzzing…
 </p>
 <p>
  A red message window appeared before Seong Jihan’s eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Expelled administrator ‘Seong Jihan’ bypasses access to the BattleNet system.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Some system functions accessible to players are partially restored.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You can level up from the status window.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stats ‘Void’ and ‘Eternity’ are activated.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Inventory opens.]
 </p>
 <p>
  …
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition to these, most functions that couldn’t be used due to expulsion were activated.
 </p>
 <p>
  [200 Red stat is consumed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The cost for this bypass access was 200 stat.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This guy really does all sorts of things.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Red’s powers were truly convenient.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking this, Seong Jihan opened his status window.
 </p>
 <p>
  Name: Seong Jihan
 </p>
 <p>
  Level: 2 (Can level up to 3)
 </p>
 <p>
  Red: 540
 </p>
 <p>
  Blue: 999 (When rising to SSS rank, +1742)
 </p>
 <p>
  Void: 50
 </p>
 <p>
  Eternity: 22
 </p>
 <p>
  Title – Martial God
 </p>
 <p>
  Remaining points: 0
 </p>
 <p>
  His level, adjusted to 2 to seal HeavenNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  But now he could raise it by 1 level, probably because he had annihilated those Elves and cut down 4 World Trees earlier.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  “In the old system, leveling up was automatic. Did you control this too?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. If you level up in the current situation, Hell will expand. Then the seal on Blue and Red would shake.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator, who deliberately changed the automatic level-up system to manual.
 </p>

 <p>
  It really seemed like he had no intention of breaking free right now.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Well then, I’ll return now.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh… okay.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you ever need my help, raise Red to 666. Then I can open my eyes again.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, wait. Let me ask one thing before you go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan hurriedly asked the disappearing eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  “In your view, can I defeat the Green Administrator with my current power?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Combat isn’t my field, but I can give a definite answer to this question.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator’s eye flashed as it was about to disappear.
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s impossible with your power alone. If you break Blue and Red’s seal and fully utilize the Hell, maybe, but then you’d be consumed by me.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is she that strong?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [She’s strong, but… She also drains life force from all living beings in the World Tree Alliance. So until the Alliance is completely annihilated, she absolutely won’t die.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Elves already showed incredible vitality, but
 </p>
 <p>
  The World Tree was leeching life force from such beings.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, if I continue terror attacks like today?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your chances would improve, but it’s better to wait until you steal the Blue Sword. If you fight before that, you won’t be able to handle Hell…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Sssss…
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator disappeared after giving this final advice.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan just blinked at Blue and Red, which had returned to normal.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This guy, why is he so cooperative?’
 </p>
 <p>
  This being that once tried to devour Seong Jihan.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  Now he was insisting that Seong Jihan should be wary of him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, even though he could take over this body if Seong Jihan fought Yggdrasil,
 </p>
 <p>
  He was actually cautioning against it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Of course, I shouldn’t trust those words 100%, but… for now, I should use his help since it’s beneficial.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking this, Seong Jihan decided,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well then, shall we head back for today?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle…
 </p>
 <p>
  He opened a red portal to return.
 </p>
 <p>
  And as he entered it,
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Jihun’s room immediately appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the darkened window and checked the time.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If it’s midnight… about 6 hours have passed?’
 </p>
 <p>
  So it took that long to subdue 4 World Tree Alliance planets, talk with the Red Administrator, and return.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If it only took this much time, I could go terrorize them every night while sleeping.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Eternity stat was also unlocked now.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Red was lacking, he could throw World Trees into Hell, and when there was excess Red, he could absorb it himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  Concluding this, Seong Jihan looked at Kim Jihun’s body again.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They said he’d be bedridden for days, but he’s still powerless.’
 </p>
 <p>
  At this rate, he would sleep soundly till morning, so there was time to spare.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Then, I should go terrorize some more.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Red Administrator recommended stopping here for today, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  That was about not absorbing more Red.
 </p>
 <p>
  Increasing the Eternity stat was a different matter.
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzing…
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan opened another portal and went around Alliance planets.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘3 more… 7 in total, huh.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In one day, he annihilated World Trees on 7 planets before returning.

 </p>
 <p>
  The next morning.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan tallied up yesterday’s harvest.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Eternity is 26. Didn’t increase much.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Eternity, which increased by 2 for high-grade B-class World Trees,
 </p>
 <p>
  And only by 1 for lower grades.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who visited one B-grade and two lower-grade places additionally,
 </p>
 <p>
  Only raised his Eternity stat by 4 yesterday.
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to the enormous life force possessed by World Trees, the absorption efficiency was quite poor, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  There was a reason for this.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I devoured this whole, Yggdrasil might detect it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Yggdrasil, who sucked up life force from all over the universe through World Trees.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he ate it all up, he might be detected by Yggdrasil.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had to trim off all the small branches, refine it, and then absorb,
 </p>
 <p>
  So the Eternity stat wasn’t very efficient considering he had consumed World Trees.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, I can just keep going around occasionally to gain ability.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The important thing was not being detected by Yggdrasil.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking this, Seong Jihan raised Kim Jihun’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He’s better after sleeping soundly, but his strength hasn’t fully returned.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, he could move around inside the house at least.

 <p>
  Seong Jihan, in Kim Jihun’s body, turned on the smartphone.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  From the morning, the news on the portal site was all about him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Why such a fuss. Again.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Jihun, the first Korean male Half-Elf to achieve 20% compatibility.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was newsworthy enough just for that, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Colonial Government designates player ‘Kim Jihun’ as ‘Special Management Target’]
 </p>
 <p>
  With the news that Namsan’s Colonial Government officially designated Kim Jihun as a ‘Special Management Target’,
 </p>
 <p>
  He was consuming all the world’s attention.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dungeon suppression device deactivation plan expected to take a step back. Stock market soaring]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Who is the male Half-Elf, ‘Kim Jihun’? The prodigy who achieved 20% compatibility for the first time in Korea]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Overseas guilds show deep interest in recruiting Kim Jihun. American First negotiation team spotted at Incheon Airport]
 </p>
 <p>
  -Wow, I didn’t know this person would hit it big like this;
 </p>
 <p>
  -For real, I thought he’d definitely fail since he came without plastic surgery lol
 </p>
 <p>
  -Some old man was criticizing why he didn’t join a guild… The situation turned completely opposite.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Is he going overseas?
 </p>
 <p>
  -Paparazzi caught him with the Daegi Guild master, isn’t he going there?
 </p>
 <p>
  -kekeke. What old Daegi Guild, of course he’s going overseas.
 </p>
 <p>
  A 20% compatibility alone was outstanding, but with the Colonial Government directly saying they’d care for him,
 </p>
 <p>
  His value had already skyrocketed beyond what Korean guilds could afford.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were several photos circulating of the Daegi Guild master and Lim Gayeong supporting Kim Jihun,
 </p>
 <p>
  But people were convinced they couldn’t hold onto this Special Management Target.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Looks like living quietly is out of the question this time too.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the media frenzy, it was similar to when he was active as Seong Jihan before.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was skimming through the articles when he frowned at the mention of overseas guilds.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Dealing with these guys is troublesome too.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Whatever treatment overseas guilds offer, in the end it’s just more money.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now that Seong Jihan’s inventory was open, he was overflowing with GP.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, the money Kim Jihun could use was another story.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I don’t have anything to spend money on anyway.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even as Seong Jihan, he just kept accumulating money.
 </p>
 <p>
  Why would Kim Jihun be any different?
 </p>
 <p>
  He was planning to keep living in Sword Palace where his sister and Yoon Seah lived anyway.
 </p>
 <p>
  His choice of the Daegi Guild was inevitable.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A guild right below my home. How convenient.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather than being bothered by other guild negotiation teams coming,
 </p>
 <p>
  He should just go down to the Daegi Guild and confirm his membership.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having made this decision, Seong Jihan called the number Lee Hayeon had written down.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ms. Lee Hayeon, this is Kim Jihun.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ah, yes! Are you feeling better? You looked really exhausted yesterday…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I feel better after sleeping. There’s a lot of news, so I was wondering if I could finalize guild membership today?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. What? Today?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. If you let me know the time, I’ll get dressed and come down now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ah, um. Just a moment, we need to adjust the conditions…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just offer something reasonable. If it’s too low, you can give me some shares or something.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ah… I see. Alright! Then… how about 12 o’clock?]
 </p>
 <p>
  12 o’clock.
 </p>
 <p>
  He guessed they had a lot to prepare.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay. I’ll come down then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan confirmed the appointment time and ended the call.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There’s an awkward amount of time left.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Maybe he should analyze Kim Jihun’s Blue in the meantime.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was thinking about what to do with the spare time,
 </p>
 <p>
  Beep. Beep beep.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sound of someone entering the passcode came from the front door.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is it my sister?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The only person who knows this house’s passcode was Seong Jiah, after all.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was thinking this,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ding ding.
 </p>
 <p>
  A warning sound indicated the wrong passcode was entered.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Did they come to the wrong house?’
 </p>
 <p>
  If it was a mistake, they would go somewhere else.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought so, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  Beep. Beep beep.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the passcode was entered and failed repeatedly, he sighed deeply and went to the front door.
 </p>
 <p>
  Click!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who is it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  And as he opened the door,
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Ah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  There stood a blonde woman.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia was standing there with a surprised look on her face.

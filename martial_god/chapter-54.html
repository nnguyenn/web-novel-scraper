  Chapter 54
 </h3>
 <p>
  [Translator – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What the hell…?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren couldn’t believe the current situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  [1st Place: Seong Jihan – 20 Kills – No Affiliation]
 </p>
 <p>
  [2nd Place: Barren – 17 Kills – American First]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’m… in second place?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Ever since acquiring the Force, he had never been knocked from the first rank!
 </p>
 <p>
  During the Top 100 Promotion Match, where he should be showcasing his brilliance to the world, he hadn’t imagined he’d be pushed back by some Asian.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had heard rumors but hadn’t realized they’d be this accurate.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Barren, this is information on the only player who could potentially threaten you during the promotion match. Please review it when you have time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When the guild manager presented data on the player named Seong Jihan,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha! A Middle-level League player threaten me? Manager, you underestimate me. Discard this info and bring me the contract we signed with Nike.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren remembered scoffing and discarding the information.
 </p>
 <p>
  The name Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had heard it once and thought he’d never hear about him again.
 </p>
 <p>
  But now…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He’s ahead of me… Should I have looked into who he was back then?’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren gritted his teeth.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I am Barren Williams, the chosen Grand Mage with an SSS-rank gift. Do I need to be wary of that punk?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was unlike him to be so frail-minded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Fire Wave!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A massive wave of fire spread from his fingertips, engulfing the entire arena.
 </p>
 <p>
  The opponent was making quite a fuss, but surely he couldn’t stand against a Fire Wave enhanced by the Force.
 </p>
 <p>
  He would burn all his enemies and secure first place.
 </p>
 <p>
  It had to be that way.
 </p>
 <p>
  But then…
 </p>
 <p>
  “What the…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  The opponent’s single strike split the wave of fire.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not just the Fire Wave, but the space Barren controlled with his Force was sliced in half.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  His shock was momentary.
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren maximized his Force.
 </p>
 <p>
  He hadn’t yet discerned the nature of the attack, but he couldn’t let his guard down.
 </p>
 <p>
  Screech!
 </p>
 <p>
  His expanding Force pushed back against Seong Jihan’s sword, clashing evenly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite his full effort, the situation remained a stalemate.
 </p>
 <p>
  By Barren’s knowledge, such an attack was impossible in the Bronze League.
 </p>
 <p>
  What in the world was this monstrous attack?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But still, I’m holding him off!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Though he was losing ground, his immediate surroundings, his Absolute Domain, remained intact.
 </p>
 <p>
  Right, no matter how powerful the attack, it shouldn’t breach this absolute domain.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huff~”
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren sighed in relief, peering through the parted flames at a figure.
 </p>
 <p>
  A man in a white shirt, an Asian, holding a white spear, looked back at him with ease.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That’s Seong Jihan…!’
 </p>
 <p>
  He’d underestimated him, dismissing him as just another player from a Middle-level Korean League, but he’d managed to harness such power.
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren bit his lip, increasing his Force.
 </p>
 <p>
  The opponent must have exerted himself with that incredible attack.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had to end this with his strongest spell.
 </p>
 <p>
  More rapid and potent than any other magic.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Lightning!”
 </p>
 <p>
  From Barren’s hand, a devastating lightning strike shot out.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren Williams.

 <p>
  To Seong Jihan, the 2020 version of him seemed like a mere child compared to before his regression.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, when comparing, it’s almost the same.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing his Fire Wave split in half, Barren was flustered and hurriedly tried to cast his next spell.
 </p>
 <p>
  In his current state, he was far from calm.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What a waste of talent.’
 </p>
 <p>
  SSS-rank Gist, My Status Window x2.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite ascending to the top with such a marvelous gift, he still couldn’t have full control over his potential and became one of the reasons for humanity’s downfall.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s gaze moved past Barren to the audience stands.
 </p>
 <p>
  There, a dark elf with black eyes silently stared back at him.
 </p>
 <p>
  A being presumed to be the ‘Shadow Queen’, whose gaze would fall on the 1st place when the match starts.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘She knew I’d win.’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘As expected, she has foresight.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan smiled and prepared his Phoenix’s Arrow in a throwing stance.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Phoenix’s Arrow… disappears after five throws, right?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Until now, there was no need to throw it, but this time was different.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not just Barren but to break through the sturdy barrier around the arena, he had to give it his all.
 </p>
 <p>
  White flames rose from the Phoenix’s Arrow that Seong Jihan held.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nameless Divine Arts, Triad of Martial Mastery: Way of Immortals
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Way of Immortals’, the technique optimized for pinpoint strikes.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the methods of stabbing and throwing were different, they shared the same trajectory, making it a suitable martial art.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Phoenix’s Arrow was soon engulfed in white flames, but the flame was just enough to barely cover the spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  It looked quite different from when the Conqueror’s Statue used it in the Conqueror’s Tomb.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Lightning!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ironically, Barren’s Lightning spell, using all of his Force, looked overwhelmingly more powerful.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thick and radiant currents of electricity, in dozens, if not hundreds, rushed towards Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shiiiik!
 </p>
 <p>
  From Seong Jihan’s hand, the Phoenix’s Arrow flew.
 </p>
 <p>
  The white flame, released a moment later than Barren’s Lightning, was so small it seemed it could be easily swallowed up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, Barren’s face contorted with dread.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…I can’t stop it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  To Barren, the moment ‘Lightning’ touched the Phoenix’s Arrow, it felt as if time stopped.
 </p>
 <p>
  The compression of magic energy was on another level.
 </p>
 <p>
  Trying to stop that with his magic was like trying to break a rock with an egg.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Absolute Domain is crumbling…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon, the Phoenix’s Arrow was upon him.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Absolute Domain controlled by the Force felt like it had vanished.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was too late to dodge the spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But… there’s still hope.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren put his hope in the Force’s Absolute Domain.
 </p>
 <p>
  The invincible domain, about 4 meters wide, which had never been breached before.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If it stops it just once…’
 </p>
 <p>
  He could then use magic consecutively and suppress that Asian!
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Please…!’
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, Barren pinned his last hope on his Absolute Domain.
 </p>
 <p>
  Without sparing any of his strength, he poured all of his Force into the Absolute Domain intending to stop the arrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shiiik!
 </p>
 <p>
  “…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  For a moment, it seemed like the Phoenix’s Arrow had halted in mid-air, just as he had hoped.
 </p>
 <p>
  But that was only for a split second.
 </p>
 <p>
  The duration for which Barren’s prized Absolute Domain could stop the Phoenix’s Arrow was only that moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  His dominating Force was torn apart.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Guh…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren, engulfed by the Phoenix’s Arrow, was incinerated in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  The genius American Mage, Barren Williams, whom the entire world expected to win, was slain by Seong Jihan’s single strike.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the other hand, Seong Jihan clicked his tongue after witnessing this.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He still can’t handle the Force properly.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as he expected.
 </p>

 <p>
  ‘If you don’t have time to cast a protective spell, you should focus all your Force to defend as much as possible instead of strengthening the Absolute Domain.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren’s reliance on Force without actively responding and ending up dead was not a matter of control, but a matter of will.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he focused on stopping the arrow, he could’ve done it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, with 1st place now firmly secured…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked past Barren to the Phoenix’s Arrow continuing its trajectory.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now it was time for the real target.
 </p>
 <p>
  To break the arena’s barrier.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  – Holy Sh- Ahem! Barren’s Fire Wave is split in half!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Player Seong! The arrow even sliced those 4 players who were dodging the Fire Wave Adding 4 kills!
 </p>
 <p>
  Channel 0’s focus had shifted from Barren to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing Seong Jihan cleave through the massive Fire Wave, commentator Christoph felt a chill down his spine.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though among all classes, Mages had the most visually impressive performances, Seong Jihan’s martial arts, which sliced through it with a single spear, gave him goosebumps.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I might actually become a fan…’
 </p>
 <p>
  He had claimed to be a fan of Seong Jihan just for lip service not long ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  But after watching his performance in this promotion match, his opinion was changing.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how much Seong Jihan was seen as Barren’s rival, he couldn’t help but be excited by his display.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ah! Player Seong has thrown his spear at Barren!
 </p>
 <p>
  – It’s carrying a bright white flame. From the look of it… Uh?!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Only from the look! Barren’s Lightning is splitting apart!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Oh my God! Barren’s absolute defense is shattering!
 </p>
 <p>
  Things took an even more unbelievable turn.
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren Williams was praised as America’s top prospect not just because of the power of his Force…
 </p>
 <p>
  But also because of the strong barrier that always surrounded him, blocking all attacks.
 </p>
 <p>
  No bronze player in America had ever landed a significant hit on Barren.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, that sturdy shield shattered in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ba-Barren! He’s been defeated!
 </p>
 <p>
  – He’s… eliminated!
 </p>
 <p>
  The voices of American commentators echoed in despair.
 </p>
 <p>
  And while shockwaves of horror erupted across the United States,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh… Ah…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon, who was watching the Top 100 promotion match at home, looked just as stunned.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  “It can’t be…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking about the money she bet on Barren, and seeing him die so effortlessly…
 </p>
 <p>
  She looked dazed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Seong Jihan even warned me twice by text…’
 </p>
 <p>
  True.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first bet on the Korea-Japan match seemed unbelievable, but for the second, she should’ve bet on Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  100% win rate.
 </p>
 <p>
  No one on Battlenet had such a record!
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if Barren was Seong Jihan’s rival.
 </p>
 <p>
  Betting on Barren instead of Seong Jihan, who showed such an overwhelming performance was plain stupid.
 </p>
 <p>
  She should’ve listened.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon pulled at her hair in frustration.
 </p>
 <p>
  After blaming herself for a while…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Player Seong’s Phoenix’s Arrow isn’t stopping! It’s about to hit the barrier!ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wh… What?!
 </p>
 <p>
  – What on earth…!
 </p>
 <p>
  The shouts of the American commentators reached Lee Hayeon’s ears.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh. What now!”
 </p>
 <p>
  And then.
 </p>
 <p>
  She forced herself to look up at the TV.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, like a personal channel, Channel 0 was solely focused on Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What… what’s that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching the screen, Lee Hayeon’s eyes trembled uncontrollably.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s… going on?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The barrier surrounding the Colosseum was completely shattered.
 </p>
 <p>
  And in the space where the barrier once stood,
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead of the elf spectators, a lightless void swayed like a night sea.

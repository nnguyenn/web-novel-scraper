  <strong>
   Chapter 55
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The ominous darkness began to creep into the sunlit arena.
 </p>
 <p>
  A bizarre phenomenon where darkness pushed away the light.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan gathered his internal energy.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘An overwhelming magical power that’s imperceptible… Defeating her is impossible.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if he possessed martial power and Force, it would be impossible to defeat the power of the Shadow Queen at his current level.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘However, I don’t need to defeat her.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recalled the content of the Epic Quest.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Find the Shadow Queen located near the spectators in the Colosseum Map and provoke her.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The quest he received wasn’t about fighting the Shadow Queen, but rather, finding and provoking her.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although it seemed he had identified the Shadow Queen,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The quest hasn’t been completed… I haven’t provoked her yet.’
 </p>
 <p>
  How could he provoke the Shadow Queen? Throwing the Phoenix’s Arrow into the darkness again would be ineffective.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan was deep in thought, the Phoenix’s Arrow, which he had launched towards the barrier, suddenly returned to his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Even after entering that darkness, the arrow’s return feature remains intact.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Though the Phoenix’s Arrow always returns to its owner, he thought its effect might be nullified due to the potent darkness.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether it was allowed by the Shadow Queen or not, the arrow continued to emit a brilliant white light.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan channeled energy into the Phoenix’s Arrow, the bright white light intensified, illuminating the encroaching darkness.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was then that he felt a subtle movement beneath his feet. Looking down, he noticed his elongated shadow morphing into a peculiar shape.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The head of the shadow had transformed into the shape of a sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Simultaneously, the sword-like shadow suddenly lunged, attempting to pierce Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  But he, who had been alert since the shadow began to form, easily dodged the attack.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sword-shaped shadow dissipated, losing its form.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, after a brief moment, it began to morph back into the sword shape.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The shadow is being infused with a foreign power. This could be endless.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, the external darkness continued to flood into the arena.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to assess the situation first.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to retreat. Just as he was about to use the Flashing Sky Thunder Steps, he felt a slight current run through his legs.
 </p>
 <p>
  The rate of the shadow’s transformation slowed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Electrical currents work.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Once more, he deliberately channeled the electrical energy from the Flashing Sky Thunder Steps into the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  The shadow was noticeably paralyzed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Even if I can suppress the energy flowing into the shadow, it won’t completely disappear.’
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how much Seong Jihan tried to neutralize the foreign energy with his electrical currents, it didn’t vanish entirely.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll leave it as it is for now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Having made up his mind, Seong Jihan cast Flashing Sky Thunder Steps to search for other players.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  The arena was in chaos.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What… what’s with these shadows?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… help!”
 </p>

 <p>
  Screams of players echoed everywhere.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike Seong Jihan, who had managed to suppress his shadow, other players were helplessly attacked by their own sword-shaped shadows.
 </p>
 <p>
  Attempts to block the attacks with shields or protective magic were futile.
 </p>
 <p>
  For some reason, the shadows ignored the players’ defenses and instantly took their lives.
 </p>
 <p>
  The number of survivors rapidly dwindled.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Only 5 survivors remain.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Top 100 Promotion Match will soon end.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon seeing the system message, Seong Jihan felt a sense of urgency.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I haven’t completed the epic quest yet.’
 </p>
 <p>
  How could he provoke the Shadow Queen?
 </p>
 <p>
  He looked around.
 </p>
 <p>
  After he broke a part of the barrier, the whole barrier in the arena had been deactivated, and darkness continued to spill in from all sides.
 </p>
 <p>
  Four players were surviving in the center of the arena, apparently unaffected by the shadows, at least for now.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, their own shadows squirmed ominously, indicating an imminent threat.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to save them first.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With a swish, Seong Jihan used the Thunderbolt Step to its full potential, quickly approaching the survivors.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What… what’s happening?”
 </p>
 <p>
  One warrior, startled by Seong Jihan’s swift approach, tried to use a skill, but Seong Jihan effortlessly parried him and simultaneously stepped on his shadow, sending electric currents into it.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sword-shaped shadow vanished, returning to its normal state, leaving the warrior stunned and confused.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Why is he helping me?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan then proceeded to rescue the other three in the same manner, placing them all in the center of the arena.
 </p>
 <p>
  The four players, turned to stone by shock, could only blink and stare at Seong Jihan, wondering about his motives.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, however, didn’t pay them any mind and instead focused on the encroaching darkness.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had observed that while the darkness seemed uniform, there were definite power hierarchies within.
 </p>
 <p>
  To verify this, he sent electric currents into the five shadows, including his own.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was not to completely suppress the shadows, but to observe from which direction the foreign power flowed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon, he felt a peculiar energy extending from the northeastern darkness.
 </p>
 <p>
  The shadows, which had been paralyzed by his electrical currents, began to recover rapidly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That’s the spot.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was clear.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Shadow Queen was located where he had broken the barrier.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now that he had pinpointed her location, all he needed to do was strike and provoke her.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, even with the Triad of Martial Mastery, reaching the Shadow Queen was a challenge.
 </p>
 <p>
  While martial arts were powerful, the opponent was exceptionally unconventional.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, among the martial arts he could use, there was one that could exploit the Shadow Queen’s vulnerability to electrical currents.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Phoenix’s Arrow blazed anew, this time not only with white flames but also with blue electric currents.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Although I haven’t fully mastered the Nameless Divine Technique…’
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t a skill registered in his system, but his body remembered it well.
 </p>
 <p>
  From the Nameless Divine Technique, Seong Jihan deployed the most suitable technique for this situation:ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m
 </p>
 <p>
  Nameless Divine Arts, Divine Thunder Decree – Striking Thunderbolt
 </p>
 <p>
  The arena was filled with the roaring sound of thunder and the brilliant light of the Phoenix’s Arrow, ready to strike.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Striking Thunderbolt’, which was best suited for countering darkness and evil, was too high-leveled for the current Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if he had fully learned it from the Wandering Martial God, he wouldn’t have been able to unleash its full potential.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I’m lacking, I’ll borrow from the Phoenix’s Arrow.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Phoenix’s Arrow, an item that disappeared after five uses, held a formidable power rivaling that of SS rank, setting aside its limitations on uses.
 </p>

 <p>
  Thus, Seong Jihan drew the power he needed from it.
 </p>
 <p>
  His hand, holding the Phoenix’s Arrow, was engulfed in flames, unable to withstand the heat.
 </p>
 <p>
  A side effect of using an advanced martial art without the support of the Nameless Divine Technique.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the excruciating pain, Seong Jihan smirked as thunder roared from the arrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Success.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  He took a stance to throw the arrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  Every muscle in his upper body tensed, his shoes digging into the ground from the immense Force.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, with a sonic boom, he threw the Phoenix’s Arrow, which split the darkness like a bolt of lightning.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the darkness receded, a Dark Elf with black eyes, presumably the Shadow Queen, appeared, standing right in the path of the Phoenix’s Arrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  But just as the arrow was about to pierce her, it halted abruptly in front of her.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dark Elf chanted in an unknown language, and the arrow’s flames and electric currents began to wane, slowly reverting it to its original form.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed Seong Jihan’s desperate attack would go to waste.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, in that split second, a white lightning bolt grazed the Dark Elf’s cheek. It was the secondary lightning strike from the Striking Thunderbolt.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although he couldn’t release the full power of the Striking Thunderbolt, resulting in a delayed attack, it worked in his favor.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dark Elf’s cheek showed a brief scorch mark before healing instantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though she barely took any damage, Seong Jihan’s objective was achieved.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have provoked the Shadow Queen.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have cleared the Epic Quest.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have been rewarded 50,000 achievement points.]
 </p>
 <p>
  It was enough for Seong Jihan, as his sole intent was to provoke the Shadow Queen.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dark Elf, with her black eyes, spoke in an unknown language and extended her hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  The surrounding darkness quickly vanished, converging into a massive black sword that stretched from her hand to the end of the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  Simultaneously, the shadows of all living players started to go wild.
 </p>
 <p>
  They had been suppressed by Seong Jihan’s electric currents, but now with the Dark Elf exerting her full power, there was no stopping them.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a shrieking sound, the shadows bound the players’ arms and legs.
 </p>
 <p>
  The climax of the battle had begun, and the true power of the Shadow Queen was about to be unleashed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bound to a metaphorical execution stand, Seong Jihan and the other players were rendered completely defenseless.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this state, they would undoubtedly fall to a single strike, and anyone could tell that Seong Jihan would be the first to face the axe.
 </p>
 <p>
  His first rank in the promotion match was at stake.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, even in such dire straits, a smile never left Seong Jihan’s lips.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m sorry, but I can’t afford to die here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, players behind him gasped in pain.
 </p>
 <p>
  One by one, they started to disintegrate into light, until only Seong Jihan remained.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dark Elf’s eyes widened in surprise. She had thought she had Seong Jihan completely restrained.
 </p>
 <p>
  How was it possible for the other players to perish in front of her, a being of overwhelming power?
 </p>
 <p>
  “See you next time,” Seong Jihan whispered.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have won the Top 100 Promotion Match.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You will log out in 5 seconds.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Before the 5 seconds elapsed, the massive dark sword, aimed to split Seong Jihan in two, swung down.
 </p>
 <p>
  But, with an unexpected twist, Seong Jihan managed to dodge the brunt of the attack.
 </p>
 <p>
  He couldn’t avoid it completely, and his left arm was severed, falling to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, in his mind, he thought, ‘That was a close one.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even amidst the pain of losing an arm, Seong Jihan logged out with a sly grin on his face.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Throne, ‘Shadow Queen’, takes an interest in you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Shadow of the Sun’ embeds itself in your left arm.]
 </p>
 <p>
  He logged out without seeing the last system message.

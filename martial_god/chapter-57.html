  <strong>
   Chapter 57
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  [“Can you hear me now?”]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [“I see.”]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can you understand what I’m saying?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [“Of course. I am an avatar of a Constellation. I can easily understand the languages of lower beings.”]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Uncle?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, standing beside him, gave a curious look.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pointing at the Black Sun, Seong Jihan tried to explain, “It might be hard to understand, but it can talk to me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really? Are you feeling okay? Can you recognize me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry, I’m not hallucinating.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay, just tell me if something’s wrong. I’ll be outside.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Yoon Seah left the room, the voice from the Black Sun spoke again.
 </p>
 <p>
  [“I have a question.”]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [“Why did the players behind you in the Promotion Match die? The main body is curious.”]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan smirked.
 </p>
 <p>
  She’d tied them up, and was curious about how he’d killed them?
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll tell you if you answer my question.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [“Agreed.”]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan then revealed, “I pre-severed the blood vessels of their hearts.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [“Hearts…”]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. I just connected them with the Force of my Qi.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In case he successfully provoked the Shadow Queen and she attacked, Jihan had prepared a fail-safe mechanism.
 </p>
 <p>
  By severing the connected blood vessels of the four players he’d kept alive, he ensured their immediate death if Qi was unavailable, thus securing his top position.
 </p>
 <p>
  [“Just that led to their deaths?”]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [“So they weren’t just lower beings, but the lowest of the low.”]
 </p>
 <p>
  The tone of the voice grew even colder.
 </p>
 <p>
  [“No matter how irregular, to think they’re the lowest of beings.”]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Lowest?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [“It’s been decided. The main body will not support you.”]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Black Sun said in an arrogant manner but Seong Jihan just chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Has it been decided that the species known as ‘human’ is useless?’
 </p>
 <p>
  A Constellation’s support would certainly have its advantages, but it would also come with a price.
 </p>
 <p>
  And he wasn’t desperate.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the end of the tutorial, many Constellations would rush to offer their support.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no need to rush and regret later.
 </p>
 <p>
  His current aim was different.
 </p>
 <p>
  Wandering Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  He needed information from the same constellation regarding the strange behavior of the Wandering Martial God, who was acting completely different from his last life.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s enough. Now it’s your turn to answer my question.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The voice hesitated for a moment, [“Ask quickly. My connection with the main body will soon be severed.”]
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s simple. What do you know about the ‘Wandering Martial God’?”
 </p>
 <p>
  […]
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s question, the Shadow Queen was momentarily speechless.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you not know anything?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [“Is he really a Martial God, not a War God?”]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, a Martial God.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [“Not ‘a’ Martial God, but ‘the’ Martial God. There are numerous War Gods among the stars, but only one Martial God. Are you sure about your description?”]
 </p>
 <p>
  The voice, previously calm, now sounded anxious, urging him to confirm.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, I’m sure.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [“If it’s the Martial God, it changes everything.”]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, it’s Martial God. Now, please answer my question.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [“The main body urgently asks if the power beyond your league is also related to the Martial God.”]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was the one who asked.”
 </p>

 <p>
  Suddenly, a black aura emitted from the Black Sun on his left arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  The aura condensed into a small, semi-transparent figure resembling a dark elf.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Dark Elf?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s Ariel.”
 </p>
 <p>
  This Ariel, with its cute yet eerie features, seemed distinct from the usual elegant elves.
 </p>
 <p>
  [“Only the main body can answer about the Martial God. It’s trying to connect to you, but…”]
 </p>
 <p>
  “But?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [“It needs GP, about 10 million.”]
 </p>
 <p>
  A system message popped up asking him to confirm the transfer of 10 million GP.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Would you like to provide 10 million GP to ‘Shadow of the Sun – Ariel’?]
 </p>
 <p>
  10 million GP.
 </p>
 <p>
  10 billion won.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s the exact amount he earned from his recent top rank.
 </p>
 <p>
  Spend all that just to hear about the Wandering Martial God?Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  “That won’t be necessary. Tell me after the tutorial.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel persisted, [“If you connect, a Constellation, ‘Shadow Queen’, will directly sponsor you. A Constellation has chosen you.”]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan smirked.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just moments ago, they seemed disinterested, but now, mentioning the Wandering Martial God changed everything.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Choosing me? I’m the one who chooses.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He was in control here, not them.
 </p>
 <p>
  [“What did you say?”]
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you want to be my Constellation, propose an interesting condition.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [“Is this a joke? From a lower being?”]
 </p>
 <p>
  “And the 10 million GP? Isn’t it just a small amount for a Constellation? Invest in me, don’t ask for it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel tried to argue, [“We can’t interfere from outside in the tutorial world.”]
 </p>
 <p>
  “But you’re here, aren’t you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [“That’s a special case-“]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan cut her off, “I’m not interested.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel blinked in surprise. [“Are you serious?”]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [“Really, truly? You might regret it.”]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I won’t repeat myself.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [“I see. Then, its goodbye.”]
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, Ariel began to dissipate. But as she was fading, a bright white light flashed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [“…The main body?”]
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel seemed completely startled.
 </p>
 <p>
  [“Actively cooperate? With a lower being? Really, the main body?”]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel mumbled to herself, growing clearer and even doubling in size.
 </p>
 <p>
  [“…I’ll follow the command.”]
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel, now fully formed, looked disgruntled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What happened?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [“The main body asks you about cooperating.”]
 </p>
 <p>
  “A Constellation said that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recalled information about Constellations.
 </p>
 <p>
  These entities, the masters of the stars, were typically arrogant and looked down on humans.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially given that Earth was at risk of being relegated from the Space League – Bronze, so, except for the Wandering Martial God, the Constellations mainly exploited players.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, now one of them was extending a unilateral favor.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Was the Wandering Martial God such a significant entity?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Regardless, he wouldn’t decline the cooperation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, at least the Constellation has some sense.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [“Having a lower being as my master…”]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Enough with the complaints. Tell me about your abilities.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A system message appeared:
 </p>
 <p>
  [The avatar of the Constellation ‘Shadow Queen’: Ariel grants you the “Shadow Sword” stat.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your status window is almost full. Would you like to accept the Shadow Sword stat?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you accept, you won’t be able to add any new stats.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Most of his status window was filled with ‘Force’ and ‘Martial Strength’.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he accepted ‘Shadow Sword’, it would occupy the last two lines.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  ‘If there wasn’t an option to expand the status window in the achievement shop, I would’ve reconsidered.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He decided to accept the stat.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The “Shadow Sword” stat has been created.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright, Shadow Sword… what is this ability?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [“It allows you to manipulate shadows, turning them into swords.”]
 </p>
 <p>
  Recalling the Promotion Match where players’ shadows became swords, Seong Jihan understood the ability.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, it’s literally a sword made from a shadow. Moreover, it’s possible to enhance the SS-grade sword, Eclipse?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is it the sword that cut my arm?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [“Yes.”]
 </p>
 <p>
  The dark sword he witnessed during the Top 100 Promotion Match seemed powerful.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I didn’t have any weapons worth mentioning until now. This is great.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Comparing the consumable Phoenix Arrow to the SS-grade: Eclipse, the latter was clearly superior.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Does the ability to enhance Eclipse mean it can grow beyond SS-grade?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  [“It can reach EX-grade.”]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  Beyond SSS-grade to a transcendent level.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ‘Achievement Point Shop Exchange Ticket’ Seong Jihan received in his regression was also EX-grade.
 </p>
 <p>
  It had more potential than he thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  [“So, focus on investing in the Shadow Sword stat.”]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, I have other stats to prioritize.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [“Stop bluffing, lower being.”]
 </p>
 <p>
  The special stat bestowed by a Constellation, Shadow Sword, was a rare stat.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel was skeptical about any stat surpassing it.
 </p>
 <p>
  [“Shadow Sword is a rare stat. You, a lower being, might not understand, but it’s different from ordinary stats.”]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I know. But what if I have unique stats?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [“…Unique?”]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Two unique stats and now one rare stat.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel looked completely baffled.
 </p>
 <p>
  [“Two fo them?!”]
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s why the rare one is not my priority.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [“…That’s impossible!”]
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel’s eyes widened in disbelief.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having unique stats, especially two, and being in Bronze league was unimaginable.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s the reality.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment, suddenly, “Uncle! We have a visitor! Wait… is that the Dark Elf from the arena?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [“Yes, the one on my arm.”]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow! That’s amazing! Is it your summon?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah’s words seemed to infuriate Ariel.
 </p>
 <p>
  [“I am not a mere summon, lower being!”]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You can speak our language!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [“Speaking the language of lower beings like you is easy for me.”]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why do you keep calling us lower beings?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [“Because you are weak.”]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, sensing the conversation might escalate, interrupted, “Seah, you said we have a visitor?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes! I think you should go out quickly. Someone from the BattleNet Administration has come.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If they’re from the BattleNet Administration, it must be Manager Park Yoonsik.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, but… it’s not just him. The Director is with him too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Director?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s eyes narrowed.
 </p>
 <p>
  After the departure of the Sword King, the Director of BattleNet Administration hadn’t visited the Sword Palace.
 </p>
 <p>
  Had his thoughts changed after watching the Promotion Match?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it. I’ll go check. Ariel, wait here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [“…No. Your ‘Shadow Sword’ stat is still too low to maintain my presence for long. I’ll return to your arm.”]
 </p>
 <p>
  With a whoosh, the black aura that formed Ariel dispersed like smoke and was absorbed back into Seong Jihan’s arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it hadn’t been for the unexpected visitor, he would’ve tested out the ‘Shadow Sword’ stat further.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘First, I should greet the guest.’
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s go, Seah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay, uncle.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan exited his room.
 </p>

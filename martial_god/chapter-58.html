  <strong>
   Chapter 58
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hahaha. It’s been a while, Mr. Seong Jihan. Remember me? We met when I came looking for the Sword King in the past.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The bulky middle-aged man, Kim Namtae, the Director of BattleNet Administration, extended his hand warmly as soon as he entered the penthouse.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It has been a while.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hello, Director.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, yes. Our Seah has grown up so beautifully. Let’s sit down and talk.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Namtae glanced at Yoon Seah with a cheerful smile and proceeded to the living room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Manager Park Yoonsik, following behind, gave a slight nod to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I watched your performance today. Truly remarkable.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you. However, it hasn’t been long since the game ended. Why this sudden visit?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, the Director said he had something urgent to discuss…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Director himself?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah! What a beautiful house!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Namtae’s voice echoed from the living room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned, wondering why such a man, known to be arrogant, would come to visit him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You said you’d donate this house. It’s an amazing house for it to be donated.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Director, already sitting at the table in the living room, gestured towards the two.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s brow furrowed even more at his attitude. It was as if he was treating them as his subordinates.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh…The Director has a bit of bossy personality. I would appreciate your understanding.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Is that so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at Manager Park Yoonsik, relaxed his expression and took his seat opposite Kim Namtae.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm, I came from far away and I’m a bit thirsty.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, Director. Would you like some orange juice or coffee?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, an iced orange juice, please. It’s been so hot lately.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What about Manager and Uncle?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m okay.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m fine too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In this way, the four seated facing each other at the table with the juice place only in front of Director Kim Namtae.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gulp~ Gulp~
 </p>
 <p>
  After a few sips of his juice, the Director addressed Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ve done remarkably well recently. Especially after the Sword King left, leaving our nation in a lull. Even though you’re just in bronze, your victory in the Top 100 Promotion Match has made the citizens very happy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan noticed the emphasis on ‘just in bronze’, but took the compliment graciously.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you for your kind words.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We have some good news for you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What news?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ve decided to award you a commendation for excellent performance.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was taken aback.
 </p>
 <p>
  All this fuss for a mere commendation? Still, he nodded in appreciation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course. It’s unprecedented for a newly ranked silver player to receive one. It’s truly an honor.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a commendation that could not be sold, Kim Namtae showed all sorts of condescension.
 </p>
 <p>
  He kept making long speeches about what an honor this commendation was, to the point that not only Seong Jihan, who heard it like that, but also Manager Park Yoonsik, who followed along, felt uncomfortable.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels
 </p>
 <p>
  “By the way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  But the Director’s demeanor suddenly shifted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s a small issue regarding your commendation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What issue?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve heard you had some trouble with Korea Daily. You might want to mend fences. They have significant influence in the industry.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Namtae, the Director of the BattleNet Administration, who discussed this, recalled an incident from a few days ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  “Director! My son was assaulted by Seong Jihan!”
 </p>

 <p>
  At a reception hosted by the CEO of an advertising agency affiliated with Korea Daily, the atmosphere got heated after a few drinks.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What? Assaulted? What are you talking about?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “My son is a silver-ranked warrior, but somehow, because of some strange technique Seong Jihan used, his leg was completely broken. They say it will take months of rehabilitation. I’d like to sue, but…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The CEO sighed deeply.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan is rising in fame. Engaging in a legal battle might tarnish our company’s image.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… that could be the case.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thus, we propose that we take over Seong Jihan’s management to settle this amicably.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Namtae narrowed his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you mean? Just because of the assault, you want to take over managing a player like Seong Jihan?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Until then, Kim Namtae had staunchly defended Seong Jihan, considering him a golden egg-laying goose.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the CEO’s proposal changed everything.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course, we are not just asking for help.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll share the profits with you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Profits? This changed the dynamics.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Seong Jihan? That guy doesn’t have a backbone.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Namtae thought of Seong Jihan as a nobody riding on the coattails of the Sword King.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He’ll obviously do as told if an adult speaks,’ he thought confidently.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the CEO’s insinuation about Yoon Seah’s weak Gift amplified his conviction.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I am sharing this in the hope that it will be of help in your persuasion. Was it Yoon Seah? I heard her Gift came out to be a low rank. So much so that she doesn’t dare to become a player.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  “Korea Daily is the victim of the assault, but they’re offering a generous proposal. They’ll manage you for 5 years and handle all advertising. Their influence is unmatched. It’s a win-win for you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Korea Daily.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. You broke the CEO’s son’s leg, didn’t you? They’re willing to overlook it and handle your advertising! Such generous people, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha…ha…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan laughed sarcastically, finding the situation absurd.
 </p>
 <p>
  He couldn’t believe Kim Namtae had thrown away the memories he spent with them for the CEO of a company who didn’t even remember him when he went to America when Korea fell.
 </p>
 <p>
  And that too, for such an insignificant reason?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This might actually be a good thing.’
 </p>
 <p>
  At this point, Seong Jihan decided to throw away the concept of ‘politeness’.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I think you’ve spoken enough nonsense.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Manager Kim Namtae blinked in surprise.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sudden shift in the situation had left him disoriented.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t just the informal language that took him aback, but the disdainful look he received, one he had never experienced since becoming the Director.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What did you just say…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I intended to deal with you politely and send you on your way, but you’ve crossed a line.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…!?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, how much did you get from Korea Daily?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Taken aback by the sudden change in Seong Jihan’s attitude, Kim Namtae’s body quivered in anger.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You… You disrespectful brat!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re the one who lost respect. I don’t even want to see your face, so leave my house immediately.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a gesture from Seong Jihan, Kim Namtae’s face turned as red as a beet.
 </p>
 <p>
  How dare a mere player, who isn’t even of a high rank, show such disrespect to him, the Director of BattleNet Administration?
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Namtae, fuming, said, “You… How dare you… Remember, I’ve been holding onto the donation from Sword Palace for you. I could have processed it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that supposed to shake me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay! Get out of this house right now!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Namtae thought he had made a persuasive threat, but Seong Jihan responded calmly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was already planning to leave, so don’t make a scene.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You, boasting just because you got some attention from the Bronze League!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why does a guy, who’s not even at the Bronze League, become a Director? If you’re a parachute, act like one. I don’t even want to talk to you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [TL/N: Parachute – is a slang term in Korean that refers to someone who gets a position or job mainly because of their connections or background, rather than their abilities or qualifications]

 </div>
 <p>
  “You…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Unable to contain his anger, Kim Namtae grabbed a glass of orange juice in front of him.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, before he could throw it at Seong Jihan, the juice splashed onto his face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Calm down.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan kindly expressed concern for the Director’s well-being.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This crazy kid! Did you use an ability?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What ability would a Silver Rank like me have? I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha! I was going to cover up the fact that Yoon Seah failed to get a Gift!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  For a moment, Seong Jihan looked puzzled, but after glancing at Yoon Seah beside him, he smirked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah, did it fail?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, it came out perfectly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Weren’t you saying it completely failed and you’re taking the university entrance exam?”
 </p>
 <p>
  From the Director’s spiteful remarks, Seong Jihan could guess where he got his information.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps he had interrogated the security guard who was watching them.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry, it turned out well. Now, please leave.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a gesture from Seong Jihan, the Director floated in the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What… What’s happening?! Let me down!”
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment, Manager Park Yoonsik, who had been restless, quickly stood up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let me escort him out!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Park Yoonsik! What are you doing? Are you scared of him?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Director! Let’s just leave for now!”
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, Park Yoonsik discreetly signaled to Kim Namtae and quickly escorted him out of the penthouse.
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching them leave, Yoon Seah looked worriedly at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle… did you get into big trouble?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Me? What did I do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You picked a fight with someone as high up as the Director of BattleNet. If he’s the manager, he’s probably an administrator of the BattleNet industry, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh? Administrator? That guy?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That person isn’t even a player. He’s just a politician who parachuted in.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so…? But won’t confronting him this way cause problems?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, it would have in the past.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In the old world, before the advent of BattleNet, money and power were the dominant means of control.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the world has changed now.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this era, players themselves have become the main actors shaping the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s just that the older generation couldn’t accept this change.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, since they couldn’t go against the powerful trend called BattleNet, the compromise they made on their own was forming an ‘organization’, and it was also a ‘pretense’ or ‘show’.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That said, with this situation, the Korea Daily will likely publish an article about Seah.’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Based on the guard’s words, they will probably sensationalize the story that Yoon Seah’s Gift is a dud.’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘To preempt unnecessary misunderstandings, we have to act first.’
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I think we should do an interview on my channel.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh~ You want to reveal my Gift before the article comes out?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh. That’s something only amateurs would do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah smirked, shaking her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s reveal the Gift after their article comes out. It’ll be more fun that way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm. Aren’t you worried about the stress from the article?”
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seah’s approach might be more effective in terms of impact, it was evident that she would be flooded with mocking and critical comments once the article spread.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was concerned about that.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle? You know, sometimes you have to eat a sweet potato to appreciate the taste of cider even more, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [TL/N: Sweet potato – refers to a situation that is tough to handle. Cider – refers to something refreshing or satisfying resolution.]
 </p>
 <p>
  It was unfortunate.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before we knew it, Yoon Seah was becoming like Seong Jihan.

  <strong>
   Chapter 6
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *

 <p>
  “An unaffiliated person is in 1st place? Is that true?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan? Who’s that? Does anyone know him?”
 </p>
 <p>
  It’d been 10 years since Battle Net spread throughout the world. Unlike the beginning, the Bronze League had long been classified as an obscure league outside of people’s interest.
 </p>
 <p>
  At least Silver had to come up to be somewhat worth watching. Especially for tutorial matches, even guild representatives mostly lacked interest.
 </p>
 <p>
  But if it was the case of Gangnam Area 1, the story was different.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The tutorial 1st place in Gangnam 1 is secured by an unaffiliated?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Lim Gayeong from the divergent guild is also participating. Of course, she would be 1st place.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “4 kills are already sufficient to get 1st place in the league. 6 kills don’t make sense.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Participating in Gangnam Area 1 required considerable abilities. An average stat ability of 9 or above, and a Gift Rank of A. Guild representatives believed that this was necessary to be within the top 50 in the tutorial.
 </p>
 <p>
  But this was still a standard based on averages. For each season, the cutline for passing the tutorial varied.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Last season, the competition was relatively easy, so even a C-rank Gift managed to pass.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But this time, the competition was fierce.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Korea’s top 10 guilds often exchanged information, so they knew about the participants in this season’s Bronze League. From July, applications for league participation were submitted, and the Gangnam 1 Bronze League, starting on July 31st, was expected to be intensely competitive.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Lim Gayeong is also participating. Naturally, She would be 1st place.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “With 4 kills, it’s a standard 1st place in the league. 6 kills are unbelievable.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lim Gayeong from the divergent guild. Known to possess an S-rank Gift, she was a promising talent that the divergent guild ambitiously put forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  The expectation for her was so high that even the pragmatic Divergent guild scouts confidently declared that she would be placed at 1st.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sigh. It’s a pity that data collection isn’t possible. Why can’t tutorials be broadcasted live…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “For now, investigate seong Jihan. The ‘seong’ surname is unique, so something might come up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The various guild scout teams divided into investigation headfirst. But for the two guilds that directly encountered seong Jihan, it was a different story.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Both of you… received the data well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The warrior and archer from the Turtle Guild who died at the hands of seong Jihan had the advantage of a Kill Cam provided by Battle Net.
 </p>
 <p>
  A third-person video captured 30 seconds before their death.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can’t believe it… truly unbelievable.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The scout team leader of the Turtle Guild watched the replay multiple times and marveled. The game called Battle Net, They knew the balance was messed up from a long time ago, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Does this make sense? Is he really Level 2?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The warrior and archer were both objectively not lacking in ability. Both had an A-rank Gift, and their equipment was among the best of B-rank. Especially the warrior was lent a top-tier full plate mail that suited his characteristics and boasted sturdy defense.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Orc weapons are at most F-rank to E-rank. Breaking through with such shoddy weapons to B-rank…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s speed especially was impressive. According to the team leader’s observation, his agility was at least 15, almost close to 20.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course, the strength stats must be at that level… No, he even pierced through armor with a shoddy weapon, so it must be beyond that. What kind of abilities does he possess to display such a state at Level 2?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The scout team leader’s eyes gleamed with curiosity.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just by looking at his clothing, he’s not even a reserve guild member. I have to recruit him somehow!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As if waking up from sleep, he joined the battle wearing a loose short-sleeved shirt and sweatpants.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the game, he was essentially unarmed and achieved 6 kills. The team leader nodded repeatedly and looked at the two in front of him. Even though it might seem like someone else’s luck, he had to uplift the guild’s promising talents.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Both of you, don’t be too disheartened. I, as the team leader, guarantee your abilities. You’ll have plenty of chances to pass in the next opportunity.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Just consider this time as… well, encountering a natural disaster. It might be better to participate in the next league. Being in the same league as that monster would just take away the chance to be promoted to Silver.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At the scout team leader’s words, the two individuals quickly nodded with downcast faces. Facing that monster continuously in the league? The thought was horrifying.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well then, rest well today.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  That way, the Turtle Guild observed seong Jihan’s performance, with the scout team leader taking direct action. Similarly, in the divergent guild, the head of HR and Division 3 personally oversaw it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this Seong Jihan’s data?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Right from the start, Dohyukgyu tried to kill him and ironically, died first. Director Jeon of the Turtle Guild’s HR Division couldn’t take her eyes off him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This person is the rumored ‘Golden parachute’…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rumored to still be in her twenties. A beauty that could rival famous celebrities. One might expect her to be at the level of a new employee just based on her appearance, but she held the title of a division head.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the rumor of a parachute floating around, she was a woman with various gossips.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s no joke…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dohyukgyu, in the prime of his life, had no interest in whether she was a parachute or not. When his gaze that occasionally flickered in her direction directly passed over her, she furrowed her brow.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why do you keep staring?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sorry, I apologize.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Be more mindful of your gaze next time. Well then, please leave.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dohyukgyu was ushered out while the USB containing the data was left behind. As he left the division office, a stern-faced woman standing behind her approached with measured steps.
 </p>
 <p>
  She was Lee Hayeon’s bodyguard.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shall I kill him, Miss?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really. Do you just kill anyone you want? You talk about killing like it’s nothing, yet you’ve never killed anyone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I did kill someone this time.”
 </p>

   Lee Hayeon looked at her. Biting her lower lip, it slightly protruded.

   As her lips returned to their place, Lim Gayeong’s expression turned impassive once again. Observing her, Lee Hayeon smiled as if unable to hold it back, then turned her attention back to the monitor and Seong Jihan’s face.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>

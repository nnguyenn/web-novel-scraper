  <strong>
   Chapter 60
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Robert Edward Gates was the second son of the Gates family, the ‘owners’ of American First.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I didn’t expect American First to contact me so openly,’ Seong Jihan pondered.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the BattleNet world, guilds could be structured like companies, with distinct owners and operators.
 </p>
 <p>
  While in most guilds the guild master played both roles, in massive guilds like American First, the guild master and the owner could be different entities.
 </p>
 <p>
  To make that distinction, the ‘owner’ needed to make significant decisions.
 </p>
 <p>
  To become the world’s number one guild, entrust the guild master position to the best player.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Gates family will demonstrate its commitment to achieving the best results.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was the philosophy of the Gates family, which controlled American First.
 </p>
 <p>
  Their method was simple but effective: use vast amounts of money to recruit outstanding players, and every two years, decide whether to retain or change the guild master based on their performance.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘In the end, Barren, with his unparalleled abilities, continued as the guild master,’ Seong Jihan remembered.
 </p>
 <p>
  While it seemed like Barren was the sole leader of American First during humanity’s final era, the actual owners were still the Gates family.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘And Robert is the head of the scouting team that only approaches the best players.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Robert introduced himself as a mere scout in the donation message, he was one of the top power players within the guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially when it came to spending money, Robert’s resources seemed limitless.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you for your generous donation, Mr. Gates. I don’t usually open my private messages, but given your significant GP donation, it seems appropriate. May I share your message on this broadcast?”
 </p>
 <p>
  No sooner had Seong Jihan finished speaking than another donation arrived.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bam!
 </p>
 <p>
  [R.E.Gates has donated 1,000,000GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Of course. In fact, I’d appreciate it if you made it public.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [General achievement, ‘Reliable support. (2)’ cleared.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You will receive 5,000 achievement points as a reward.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers erupted.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wait, the number just got bigger. It seems there’s an extra zero?
 </p>
 <p>
  – 1 billion!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 </p>
 <p>
  – That’s the level of a top-tier guild for you.
 </p>
 <p>
  – ??? : Is he trying to buy the message box with money!
 </p>
 <p>
  – It’s too much money to scold him about…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Holy sh*t! Is American First this rich?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Of course. The Gates family is among the top wealthiest in the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan responded calmly, “Shall we see what American First has proposed together?”
 </p>
 <p>
  He opened his system window and switched his private message status to public.
 </p>
 <p>
  He then found and opened Robert’s message, which was a guild contract proposal translated neatly into Korean.
 </p>
 <p>
  The signing bonus alone was $300 million, an unimaginable amount for a newly minted Silver Rank player.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan read out all the proposed terms in detail. The viewers’ reactions were as expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  – I can’t resist this…ㅠㅠ
 </p>
 <p>
  – With that kind of money, I’d emigrate to the US too.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Sigh… that’s why people go to America…
 </p>
 <p>
  The Korean viewers seemed to have given up.
 </p>
 <p>
  – $300 million? AF sure spends a lot.
 </p>
 <p>
  – That’s Gates’ money. There is one condition, however: Seong must become a US citizen.

 <p>
  The American viewers cheered,
 </p>
 <p>
  – Oh! Naturalization? Welcome!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Teaming up with Barren Williams… Fantastic!
 </p>
 <p>
  There was a consensus among them that, despite the overpayment, they should get the best players at any cost.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you for such a generous offer. I can’t give an immediate response, but I’ll contact you later,” said Seong Jihan, closing the message window.
 </p>
 <p>
  – If it were me, I’d accept right away.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Taking a break before diving in, huh?
 </p>
 <p>
  Robert Gates’ donation and the shocking recruitment proposal from American First allowed the viewers to gauge Seong Jihan’s current stature.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan clapped his hands, changing the mood, “Now, shall we return to our main topic?”
 </p>
 <p>
  – What were we discussing again?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Oh, Yoon Seah’s Gift?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Got brain freeze after hearing about the signing bonus
 </p>
 <p>
  – My brain froze when I saw a donation of 1.3 billionÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m
 </p>
 <p>
  The original topic that everyone had forgotten due to Robert Gates was Yoon Seah’s Gift.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nudged Yoon Seah, who seemed lost in her thoughts.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Yeah?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s time to show your Gift.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She took a deep breath and opened her status.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Gift – Late Bloomer (Rank-F – Participate 50 times in the game to upgrade)]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Upgrades the basic BattleNet system.
 </p>
 <p>
  To upgrade it, you must participate in BattleNet games.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [F-rank Effect: Increases daily game participation by 1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [100% increase in natural stat growth.]
 </p>
 <p>
  – A great vessel is made late. Do you understand, South Koreans?
 </p>
 <p>
  – A growing Gift? Damn!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Haven’t heard of anything like this before.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Even at F rank, it twists the system. How is this a trash Gift?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Trash? Trash? Trash? Trash? Trash? Trash? Trash? Trash?
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the Gift was currently at rank F, viewers were stunned by the unique ‘upgrade’ aspect they hadn’t seen before.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Despite having such a Gift, do you think she should still take the college entrance exam?”
 </p>
 <p>
  – Why even bother with exams lol. She can pick any college she wants.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Why does she need an exam? Oh, Korean friends. This person doesn’t need to be judged by an exam.
 </p>
 <p>
  – The Korea Daily really messed up.
 </p>
 <p>
  – She clearly has an amazing Gift.
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers reacted just as Seong Jihan had predicted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “However, aren’t you curious why such a mistake was made by Korea Daily?”
 </p>
 <p>
  – ??? Was there a reason?
 </p>
 <p>
  – They probably rushed the scoop, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Actually, I had an issue with them during Seah’s Gift ceremony.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan showed the viewers a video captured by a security guard, depicting a Silver player causing a scene.
 </p>
 <p>
  Furthermore, “Perhaps due to my past with them, the BattleNet Administration Director paid me a visit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan also played a recording of the administration director, who, under the influence of Korea Daily, tried to force Seong Jihan into an advertising and management contract.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan laid out all the cards, revealing the truth behind the misleading article on Yoon Seah and the challenges he had faced.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is the real story behind the article about Seah and the events I encountered.”
 </p>
 <p>
  – Is this the 1980s?
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  – They crossed the line!
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers were incensed by the BattleNet Administration Director’s antics.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Damn, this guy’s infuriating. Using a commendation as a threat?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Threatening with an exclusive story is so pathetic
 </p>
 <p>
  – What?! The Administration Director siding with a corporation to oppress a player? Seong, come to the U.S. fast!
 </p>
 <p>
  – He won’t betray his country!!!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Who the hell is this?
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  The chatroom exploded with condemnations against Korea Daily and the Administration Director.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan watched the reactions for a moment before speaking.
 </p>
 <p>
  “My original plan was to establish a guild in Korea. I had a personal experiment I wanted to conduct.”
 </p>
 <p>
  – A guild? By a Silver?
 </p>
 <p>
  – With so many invites, why create a guild? Moreover, isn’t Korea already a
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  competitive red ocean?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Shh! He said he had an experiment.
 </p>
 <p>
  – He should stay in Korea, why the fuss?
 </p>
 <p>
  “However, with the Administration Director acting like this… I’m hesitant about how I, a mere player, should operate a guild in Korea.” Seong Jihan said, appearing more relaxed than his words conveyed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “For now, Seah and I will remain in Korea until September. But if major corporations and government agencies continue to pressure me, I might consider moving to a country that offers the best terms.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Immediately following that, a barrage of donations came in.
 </p>
 <p>
  [R.E.Gates has donated 100,000GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Player Seong, if you establish a guild in the US, our guild will assist you. The U.S. government will also fully support you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [★☆Take-chan☆★ has donated 100,000GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Seong-san~ Isn’t Japan closer and better than the U.S? I, Take-chan, will prepare everything for you! Just say the word!]
 </p>
 <p>
  – Take-chan increased the donation amount
 </p>
 <p>
  – He’s probably feeling the pressure~
 </p>
 <p>
  – Suddenly there’s a recruitment competition…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Please, just not Japan. If you’re going to go, go to the U.S. ㅠㅠㅠ
 </p>
 <p>
  The mention of a guild formation intensified the recruitment competition from various countries.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether it was America First or the Neo Self-Defense Force, the connection with their respective governments made this a high-stakes situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan continued, “Thank you for the donations. Establishing a guild in either the US or Japan would certainly spare me from political pressures.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He smirked, “Unless Korea Daily and the Administration Director publicly apologize and promise not to repeat such actions, I might seriously consider these offers.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Though I don’t really intend to leave Korea…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The signing bonus of 300 million dollars and the incredible terms offered by Robert Gates were tempting, but Seong Jihan didn’t want to leave his homeland.
 </p>
 <p>
  The national bonus after the tutorial and the desire to defeat the Sword King as Korea’s representative were part of his motivation.
 </p>
 <p>
  He added, “However, I love my home country, South Korea, and wish to stay. But for that… I desperately need your support.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers understood his subtle plea, rallying to exert public pressure for a resolution.
 </p>
 <p>
  – So if they apologize, you’ll stay here?
 </p>
 <p>
  – What are you doing? Let’s start a petition.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Shouldn’t we start a boycott against Korea Daily??
 </p>
 <p>
  – Let’s just do both
 </p>
 <p>
  – The director looks like an old fogey. Think he’ll apologize?
 </p>
 <p>
  – We’ll make him.
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers were actively rallying behind Seong Jihan. With a tear in his eye, he bowed deeply.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Everyone, I am a Korean… and I want to remain a Korean. I hope this sentiment isn’t changed by external pressures…”
 </p>
 <p>
  And with that, public opinion erupted.

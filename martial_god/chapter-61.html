  Chapter 61
 </p>
 <p>
  Crash!
 </p>
 <p>
  “You… you crazy bastard!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the office of the BattleNet Administration Director, Kim Namtae threw a glass cup in fury.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘How did the situation change overnight…!’
 </p>
 <p>
  His trembling eyes stared at the headlines flashing across the main page of the portal site.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Seong Jihan’s Shocking Confession! “Might go to the US or Japan…”]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The vile cartel between Korea Daily and the Administration Director revealed through recordings!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Seong Jihan, who received a “300 billion” offer from America First, will he leave?]

  [Seong Jihan’s plea: ‘I want to be a Korean…’]
 </p>
 <p>
  [What is the world’s first growth-type gift, ‘Late Blommer’, possessed by Yoon Seah?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks to Seong Jihan releasing the audio recordings and videos, various media outlets were competing to report yesterday’s events with the most sensational headlines.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This… this mere Silver…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  America First, the world’s top guild, had reportedly made an offer of 300 billion.
 </p>
 <p>
  The signing bonus was an objective measure of a player’s value.
 </p>
 <p>
  The massive amount revealed Seong Jihan’s worth to the entire nation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ring!
 </p>
 <p>
  Click!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stop calling!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Namtae shouted in frustration due to the continuous calls from reporters.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the next call he received was different.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Director of Administration, this is the Office of the Senior Secretary for Civil Affairs.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon a cold voice settled in his ears.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  Office of Senior Secretary for Civil Affairs, Blue House.
 </p>
 <p>
  The call came from the secretariat, the most powerful person in the government.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m… I’m sorry!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [VIP does not want this issue to escalate further.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “But… but…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Settle it amicably with Seong Jihan.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You want me to bow down to a Silver Rank player?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Namtae complained, but the answer was cold.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Or are you considering resignation?]
 </p>
 <p>
  After the Sword King’s naturalization in Japan and the negative public opinion towards the government, they couldn’t afford to have a top prospect like Seong Jihan clash with the Administration Director. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Namtae, once a politician, understood the implications and felt a chill run down his spine.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Also, give him the Excellence Award and the commendation without any conditions.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll follow your instructions…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Thank you, Director.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Click!
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Namtae stared blankly at the phone.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I have to apologize?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Yes, he acknowledged Seong Jihan as a promising player.
 </p>
 <p>
  But he was just a silver rank.
 </p>
 <p>
  To think that he, the Administration Director, would have to apologize in front of the entire nation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It would’ve been less embarrassing if I got slapped…!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Wasn’t he the one who got splashed with juice?
 </p>
 <p>
  Aside from his comments about Korea Daily, had he done anything wrong?
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Namtae was consumed with frustration and resentment.
 </p>
 <p>
  Similarly, Korea Daily felt the same frustration and resentment.
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the Korea Daily building’s CEO office, Kim Heesu stood with his head bowed, resembling a criminal.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">

 </div>
 <p>
  “Kim Heesu.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, grandfather…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you even a journalist?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, I’m not.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then why did you step out and create such a mess?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The 70-year-old CEO of Korea Daily glared at Kim Heesu with icy eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We are Korea’s top media outlet. We should be manipulating public opinion, not being swayed by it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Silence.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, if you had published the article before Seong Jihan became a sensation, there might have been room for negotiation. But you watched everything unfold in the media and still released such an article!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  The CEO of Korea Daily, his face red with anger, slammed his fist on the desk.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even I, in my 70s, understand that BattleNet players have become the center of the world!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But, sir…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sports have integrated with BattleNet. Their role in national security isn’t insignificant either. Shouldn’t you, attending the BattleNet Academy, know the importance of a player’s role better?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Unable to meet her grandfather’s accusatory gaze, Kim Heesu lowered her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  The public opinion, which had turned around in just a day, was fervently criticizing both Korea Daily and the Administration Director.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Who would have thought Seong Jihan would react like this…!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was not just a player with high stats.
 </p>
 <p>
  He knew his position well and could sway public opinion.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had rallied the public through his channel which had already crossed 500,000 subscribers.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The threat of possibly moving to the US hurt the most.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The term “abuse of power” had always been associated with the Korea Daily family and the Administration Director.
 </p>
 <p>
  They had never imagined being on the receiving end of it from a mere Silver Rank BattleNet player.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kim Heesu, you caused this. Solve it on your own.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I tried, but… he’s not taking my calls…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If he’s not taking your calls, then find him and beg on your knees!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The CEO of Korea Daily angrily crumpled a newspaper on his desk.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Take Kim Insik with you and make sure he apologizes properly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But brother still has a cast on?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good. Then maybe Seong Jihan will take pity on you guys.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Silence.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Heesu was at a loss for words.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even towards his injured grandson, the CEO was ruthless.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Resolve this within a week. If the company faces any more damage, I won’t stay silent.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kim Heesu felt her vision darken.
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  At Sword Palace’s penthouse.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mr. Seong Jihan… The Director feels deeply responsible for the recent discord and… wishes to convey his apologies.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Park Yoonsik, the Manager who had come again, delivered the Director’s message.
 </p>
 <p>
  “And he mentioned the award ceremony will proceed as planned. He would appreciate your presence to grace the occasion…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan smirked.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘As expected.’
 </p>
 <p>
  That man would never come to apologize personally.
 </p>
 <p>
  He’d be seething inside at having to send a representative for such a half-hearted apology.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What I want is a formal apology. The person responsible should come and bow down in front of me and also release a statement to the media.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If that doesn’t happen, I won’t accept any awards. I’m not particularly interested in anything from the Administration.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But… If you decide to establish a guild, we can help! If you can settle this issue amicably, maybe…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s alright. I can establish it from my home. I’m sorry, but I’d prefer if you leave now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Park Yoonsik, his face pale, was shown the door by Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  The latter felt no particular resentment towards the Administration Director or Korea Daily anymore.
 </p>
 <p>
  Under normal circumstances, he might have accepted their apologies.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But they need to understand the consequences of messing with me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  They were an example.
 </p>
 <p>
  An example of what happens when someone crosses him.

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Even if Kim Namtae personally came to apologize today, Seong Jihan wouldn’t have accepted it immediately.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Director needed to suffer public criticism for a few days to understand the gravity of his mistakes.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The current issue can wait. The important thing now is to establish the guild.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan clicked on the ‘Guild Establishment’ option, which had been activated after he reached the silver rank.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Would you like to establish a guild?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [To create a guild, you need 10 million GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The cost of establishing a guild was equivalent to 10 billion Korean won.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan would need to invest all the money he won from betting, an enormous sum.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Administration could provide financial support…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Government support isn’t free.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  If they provided GP for guild establishment, the government would demand a stake in the guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan felt more comfortable establishing the guild with his own money rather than giving away part of it.
 </p>
 <p>
  He boldly paid the GP and proceeded to the next step.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Please name your guild.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Guild name…”
 </p>
 <p>
  He pondered the reason for establishing the guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  Firstly, he aimed to complete guild-related achievements to earn achievement points.
 </p>
 <p>
  Secondly, he wanted to create a ‘Nurturing Guild’, a concept not yet established during the tutorial phase.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Like America First’s secondary guild.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Such Nurturing Guilds would lose their importance once Seong Jihan and Yoon Seah reached their growth limits.
 </p>
 <p>
  And at the pinnacle of the guild’s growth would coincide with the completion of Yoon Seah’s latent potential.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s name it ‘Daegi’.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, Seong Jihan named the guild ‘Daegi’, symbolizing the realization of latent potential.
 </p>
 <p>
  [TL/N: Guild Name – ‘Daegi’ is taken from ‘Daegi Manseong’ which is a Korean idiom that means “great talents mature late” or “good things come to those who wait”. The closest translation would be ‘Waiting’ or ‘Great Talent’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The guild has been established. Your guild rank is silver.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have established a guild.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Special achievement, ‘Guild Establishment’ cleared.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have earned a reward of 10,000 achievement points.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As expected, immediately after establishment, he received achievement points.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though it seemed small compared to the recent 50,000 points he earned, it was still a significant amount.
 </p>
 <p>
  He anticipated more points as he completed more guild-related achievements.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Please distribute guild points.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have 10 points available for distribution.]
 </p>
 <p>
  For the second purpose, distributing guild points was essential.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Guild Member Expansion (1/10) – LV.1]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stat Increase (All stats +1) – LV.1]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Growth Rate Increase (+10%) – LV.1]
 </p>
 <p>
  Typically, guilds first invested in ‘Guild Member Expansion’.
 </p>
 <p>
  Increasing the member count was vital for guild expansion and growth.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No need for that.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, aiming for an elite Nurturing Guild, had no intention of investing in member expansion.
 </p>
 <p>
  The most crucial aspect of a Nurturing Guild was the ‘Growth Rate’.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Growth Rate Increase option, without any point investment, allowed for stat and skill growth through training.
 </p>
 <p>
  This option wasn’t popular during the tutorial phase.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, as humanity continued to decline post-tutorial, the necessity for Nurturing Guilds grew, leading to the re-evaluation of the Growth Rate Increase option.
 </p>
 <p>
  And Seong Jihan was well-acquainted with this knowledge.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This option alone isn’t very effective.’
 </p>
 <p>
  To be a Nurturing Guild, another factor was needed to boost the growth rate.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A supporting Gift.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The guild master of America First’s secondary guild possessed a supporting Gift known as ‘Nurturing’.
 </p>
 <p>
  The only reason an immigrant from the devastated Korea, who couldn’t even show his face, became a guild master was because of that gift.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan took out his phone and searched for Lee Hayeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Although I didn’t know she was the daughter of a conglomerate…’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘She must have made some money from the Top 100 Promotion Match.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He assumed she’d be somewhat receptive to his proposal.
 </p>
 <p>
  Confident that Lee Hayeon would have earned a profit, Seong Jihan dialed her number.

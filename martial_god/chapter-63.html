  Chapter 63

 </p>
 <p>
  Chapter 63
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wha… this is…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You should have some stakes if you’re going to treat it like your own guild.”
 </p>
 <p>
  20% shares.
 </p>
 <p>
  As expected, Lee Hayeon was taken aback by the unexpected offer.
 </p>
 <p>
  “20% is too much!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s what you deserve for your abilities.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In reality, even 20% wasn’t truly equivalent to Lee Hayeon’s worth.
 </p>
 <p>
  She had managed a secondary guild in America First while hiding her face behind a mask of addiction because her gift was that extraordinary.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘By tying her with 20% shares of a startup guild, it’s a bargain.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially if the guild was used just for achievement points and buffs, she wouldn’t truly gain anything substantial from it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even with these thoughts, Seong Jihan maintained a pleasant facade.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I hope you do your best with the shares given. I have high expectations.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon’s heart fluttered at Seong Jihan’s acknowledgment.
 </p>
 <p>
  She hadn’t even expected to receive shares, let alone such a significant portion.
 </p>
 <p>
  Has anyone ever valued her supporting gift this much before?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s so different from my brother.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Tears welled up in her eyes as she affirmed, “I’ll do my very best!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing her passion, Seong Jihan felt a twinge of guilt.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Should I have just given her 10%? It’s just a startup guild share, why is she so fired up?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Not knowing the full circumstances, he became anxious, fearing the situation might unnecessarily escalate.
 </p>
 <p>
  And his anxiety became reality.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll arrange for a guild office right away. There’s a vacancy in Sword Palace. Oh, by the way, do you have any plans to move?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, even if we move, it will take some time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then I’ll rent an office here for now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s fine… I’ll provide the funds.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He had leftover sponsorship money from Robert Gates and said he would invest as an owner.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, I can’t accept that. I’ve received shares, so I should bear 20% of the responsibility. I’ll take care of it, even if we have to start from a small place…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon confidently stated her intent to pay, her eyes shining.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Also, we’ll set up an official guild BattleTube.
 </p>
 <p>
  The revenue from there, as well as ad sponsorships, will cover operational costs, owner.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh. Well… go ahead.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But, owner? I’m sorry, but it would be great if you could appear on the guild BattleTube frequently in the early days. We’ll probably rely on your subscribers initially.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can’t appear often.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Once or twice a week would be enough.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If that’s all…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The situation was growing bigger.
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching the enthusiastic Lee Hayeon, Seong Jihan momentarily regretted if he had made a careless decision.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No… it’s actually better this way. She’ll actively work, and the guild achievements will be completed faster.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He decided to view the hard-working guild master in a positive light for now.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you have any plans to increase the guild members?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, we’re focusing on the growth rate.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then our guild concept should be nurturing potential talents. Do you have anyone in mind?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah will join, and there’s one more.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought of Diego Masied, who possessed the SSS-tier gift ‘God of Soccer’.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now that he had established a guild, it was time to contact him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, six spots left?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can we temporarily add Gayeong? She won’t need a salary; Divergent Guild will cover her.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Miss…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lim Gayeong, who had been standing quietly, was shocked.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  She was already being treated as a promising member of the Divergent Guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moving her to a new startup guild seemed unreasonable.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s fine if it’s temporary.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t agree…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shush. Consider it a blessing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Due to Lee Hayeon’s strong insistence, Lim Gayeong was reluctantly added to the Daegi Guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  She might have been grumbling internally at that moment, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have joined the Daegi Guild.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your growth rate has increased. Current Growth Rate – 220%.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your experience gain has increased by 30%.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What… is this?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The significant advantage of joining the Daegi Guild became instantly evident upon reading the system messages.

 <p>
  In the supermarket located on the basement floor of the Sword Palace building:
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, who was shopping, turned her head at the familiar voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Heesu? What brings you here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I came to see you. I’ve been waiting to catch you at your private elevator…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Alongside the humble Kim Heesu was Kim Insik, limping with a plastered leg. Their faces were pale, suggesting the depth of the crisis they had faced.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah… I’m so sorry about everything! Please forgive me!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m also at fault…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay, get me that salmon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She acknowledged their apologies with a simple nod and continued shopping, leaving them feeling ignored. Kim Heesu was grinding her teeth but bowed even lower.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah, please… I got kicked out of my house. We were friends, weren’t we? Can’t you forgive me just this once?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite her attempts at ignoring her, Kim Heesu persisted, hinting at the severe backlash she had faced at home.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So annoying.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, after watching Seong Jihan’s broadcast, no longer harboured any particular feelings towards Kim Heesu. The constant pestering was simply tiresome.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Fine. I accept your apology.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just like that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Caught off guard by her sudden forgiveness, seah swiftly added, “Now, stop following me. It’s bothersome.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can you please ask your uncle to mention on the broadcast that we’ve settled matters?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why should he? Just publish an apology in your newspaper.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Feeling the resistance, Yoon Seah surmised why they personally came to apologise.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll discuss it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Though she didn’t voice it, she doubted her uncle would oblige. It would just be more hassle otherwise.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you!”
 </p>
 <p>
  She watched as Kim Heesu and the limping Kim Insik departed from the supermarket. After wrapping up her shopping, she shared the episode with Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good job. If they bother you, just shake them off.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Will you mention the settlement on the broadcast?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why should I? Tell them to post an apology.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I thought as much.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah then steered the conversation to the new guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, you really made a guild?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan proceeded to explain the guild’s concept.
 </p>
 <p>
  A nurturing guild focusing solely on growth rate.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Daegi Guild, currently at silver rank, had invested all 10 points into the growth rate increase, making it level 11.
 </p>
 <p>
  “With the addition of Lee Hayeon, who has a supporting gift, the efficiency of the growth rate option doubled. The experience gain is just a bonus.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I know of past attempts to focus on growth rate options, but they all failed.”

 </div>
 <p>
  “It’ll be different this time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really? But the name… Daegi Guild… Is it named after ‘Daegimanseong’ (patience)?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. So?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Feels like you named it in a hurry.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite her complaints, Yoon Seah felt grateful, assuming he had her in mind when naming it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon joining the guild, her eyes widened in surprise.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Whoa. Why is the growth rate benefit so high?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have joined the Daegi Guild.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your growth rate has increased. You now grow at 220%.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your experience gain has increased by 30%.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What… is this?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon joining the guild, her eyes widened in surprise.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Whoa. Why is the growth rate benefit so high?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The new benefits from the guild had a visible impact.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now, your training will yield even better results. Your stats will increase much faster,” Seong Jihan remarked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, my stamina has already increased by 1.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Already?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s brow furrowed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah’s awakening was on the 25th.
 </p>
 <p>
  Today is the 30th, so not many days have passed since she started training.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘And her stats increased in that short amount of time?’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Even accounting for the effects of her Gift, this is incredibly fast. This is… a natural talent.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With the backing of the guild’s buffs now, how much faster will she grow?
 </p>
 <p>
  Holding onto this anticipation, Yoon Seah asked Seong Jihan,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle, you said that if I raise my stamina to 10 through training before level 10, I can get a rare stat, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Within 100 days of awakening, before reaching level 10, you need to raise your stamina by 10 through training.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The rare stat ‘Endurance’ was an upgraded version of stamina.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the future, it was the first known method of obtaining a rare stat.
 </p>
 <p>
  The requirement was simple but challenging due to the 100-day limit.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before the training-oriented guilds like Daegi Guild came into existence, most players, even if they knew the method, couldn’t obtain the stat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Should I skip the September League until I increase my stamina to 10?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No. Training in-game is more efficient. Moreover, considering the nature of your gift, it’s essential to play regularly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Participate in the September League from Gangnam Place 3.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gangnam Place 3 was filled with casual gamers, unlike Gangnam Place 1, which housed the elite prospects.
 </p>
 <p>
  The difficulty level in Gangnam Place 3 was significantly lower than in Place 1.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Training there won’t draw attention.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right, so I just need to exercise in the game?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, even more rigorously than now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  While discussing Yoon Seah’s training direction, Seong Jihan’s phone vibrated. It was a call from Lee Hayeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Owner!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just call me Jihan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [No way! I will address you as ‘Owner’ until I repay your gracious gift of the 20% stake!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…As you wish. What’s the matter?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Mr. Masied has arrived at the guild office. If you and your niece could come, we plan to introduce the guild live on BattleTube.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Already?”ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels
 </p>
 <p>
  It was just yesterday when he provided the stake for guild operations.
 </p>
 <p>
  Setting up an office and even planning a streaming introduction for the guild in just a day showcased rapid progress.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. You should also start streaming on BattleTube. It will be a great promotion. Please come down!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Without Seong Jihan’s subscriber base, any BattleTube stream would have negligible viewers.
 </p>
 <p>
  His presence was crucial for guild promotion.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood. Let’s go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, the humble guild, consisting of one Silver member, two Bronzes, and two level 1 players who hadn’t even participated in the league, commenced their promotion efforts.
 </p>
 <p>
  – What the heck is this????
 </p>
 <p>
  – How are these stats even possible??
 </p>
 <p>
  Their introductory video caused a significant uproar in the community.

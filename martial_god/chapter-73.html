  Chapter 73

  [Translator – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  Chapter 73
 </p>
 <p>
  – Amazing! Even Masheid’s magic power increased by 1.
 </p>
 <p>
  Currently known as the “god of soccer”, a now laughable trait, Diego Masheid’s magic power naturally increased by 1.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Masheid is continuously ranking 1st right now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Masheid, who intentionally kept losing to drop his level to 1, is showing off an insane record after switching to a magician following the class reset. Using a magic orb that looks like a soccer ball, everyone was turned to ashes against him, as if a silver league mage entered a bronze match.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wasn’t Masheid one of the top 3 trolls of Gangnam? Why has he changed so suddenly?
 </p>
 <p>
  – He started using magic and now he’s doing really well. Hahaha.
 </p>
 <p>
  – But how can he raise his stats so easily?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Is the growth rate increase effect really useful?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Only Gayeong’s stat didn’t increase, LOL.
 </p>
 <p>
  – She’s only been in the guild for a week. That’s normal.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Honestly, Her stats not increasing is expected, but looking at her, it seems abnormal.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did your stats also increase, Owner? If you don’t want to make it public, it’s alright.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “My shadow skill did increase.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah! So, excluding Gayeong, everyone else benefited.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon, who just entered the guild office, looked at Lim Gyeoung who had just played a BattleNet match, and smiled teasingly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Miss, why are you smiling at me like that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm, it’s a pity since only Gyeong’s ability didn’t increase.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…It will increase soon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You train in the game, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What kind of training are you talking about?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Watch this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Hayeon turned the monitor to show a video from Yoon Seah’s channel. In survival mode, she wore heavy armor, ran all day, and did hundreds of squats waiting for zombies in a defense map.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lim Gayeong shook her head while watching it, “If I do that, I won’t be able to fight later.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But your stats will increase. Stats!!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I’ll try it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers watching the broadcast were shocked. It’s not even like physical training in BattleNet, it’s way too extreme.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Hey… Don’t you need to reserve stamina to fight monsters? Why work out with that heavy armor?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Maybe because she has pain reduction, it’s okay to push herself hard?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Pain reduction and muscle fatigue in BattleNet might work differently, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Crazy… you need to do that much to increase stat points.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah exercises even after the game ends every day, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, I heal her every day.”
 </p>
 <p>
  – She exercises while getting healing??
 </p>
 <p>
  – That’s some intense training.
 </p>
 <p>
  It probably was due to the major effect of the growth rate increase, but there seemed to be a reason Yoon Seah’s stamina increased by 2 in such a short time.
 </p>
 <p>
  – This is really insane.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  – To increase a stat, you usually need to level up, but in Yoon Seah’s case, she got 2 points for free?
 </p>
 <p>
  – If you can create such a gap early on, won’t you dominate later?
 </p>
 <p>
  – I thought the growth-focused guild was nonsense.
 </p>
 <p>
  – If it’s something Jihan does~~ Of course~~~~ it’s effective!!
 </p>
 <p>
  The growth rate of the Daegi guild was amazing, but whether this was genuinely beneficial or not was a matter of public opinion. However, after Hayeon’s recent stat growth disclosure, it was clear there was a significant benefit.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  “Actually, I planned to report the stats increase of guild members to the owner every two weeks… but with such amazing progress fitting for a Daegi guild, I wanted to report it sooner.”

 <p>
  With that, Hayeon looked into the camera and showed her fingers.
 </p>
 <p>
  “And for the guild members out there~ two slots are already reserved, three slots are left. Send over your rising stars who wish to grow fast! We rent them for just 5 million GP a month!”
 </p>
 <p>
  – 5 million GP, wow!!
 </p>
 <p>
  – That’s like 5 billion. It’s so expensive for a month.
 </p>
 <p>
  – But if you can get 1 or 2 stat points in a month, it’s not a loss.
 </p>
 <p>
  – If you definitely can get 1-2 stat points, it’s super beneficial, LOL. It’s no different from a level difference. When you go to the diamond league, the levels don’t increase that much.
 </p>
 <p>
  The promising player development rental fee being 5 billion won, To the general public, it seemed like an exorbitant price. However, if one was assured of gaining even a few stat points, this price was rather affordable.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Two slots are already reserved?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. One promising player each from America First and People’s Association has agreed to send. And also…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “And?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon glanced at the camera. ‘I left the offer from the Neo Self-Defense Force pending. There’s no need to mention it here.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Ever since Sword King left the country, the sentiment Koreans held for the Neo Self-Defense Force was close to vehement hatred.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘After today’s broadcast, if the three slots fill up quickly, there’s no need to accept them.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With that thought, Lee Hayeon smiled subtly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There are more than five guilds showing significant interest.” Lee Hayeon wrapped up the broadcast without mentioning the Neo Self-Defense Force.
 </p>
 <p>
  That day’s broadcast caused major ripples in the BattleNet industry because the efficacy of the growth rate increase option had been proven.
 </p>
 <p>
  – It really had an effect on the growth rate…
 </p>
 <p>
  – There must have been a reason why Sung Jihan put Lee Hayeon as the guild master.
 </p>
 <p>
  – What’s her gift?
 </p>
 <p>
  Several investigations into the standby guild began.
 </p>
 <p>
  – We need to send our player to secure the remaining slot.
 </p>
 <p>
  – 5 million GP a month, isn’t that too expensive?
 </p>
 <p>
  – The stats increased in less than a week. Later on, 5 million GP will be considered a bargain.
 </p>
 <p>
  Other guilds, which hadn’t been seen for a while, seriously began to put their promising players forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even Barren, once considered the world’s top prospect, changed his mind after watching the broadcast.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  In recent days, Barren had been reflecting.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This can’t go on.’
 </p>
 <p>
  After the ‘Top 100’ match, Sung Jihan became his most cautious rival.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Sung Jihan was lightly capturing jungle monsters and flying around in the valley map, it took Barren several tries to defeat even one jungle monster. And that was only the weakest one. He didn’t dare approach the more powerful monsters.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to grow.’
 </p>
 <p>
  From the world’s top prospect, he needs to grow somehow to become the best player in the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s not the time to be prideful!’
 </p>
 <p>
  After sobering up, the clear-headed Barren pondered.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Now that the growth rate buff of the standby guild has been proven effective, it’s time to move.’
 </p>
 <p>
  “Robert. I’ll be the one to go to the Daegi guild as promised.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm. One of our guild members is also very interested in that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Support Sophia.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren frowned at the mention.
 </p>
 <p>
  Support Sophia, now 19, was one of America First’s next-generation prospects after Barren.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do we need to invest that much in a support? I’ll go instead of her.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm. She was adamant about wanting to go though…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you sending her? Hmm… I’ll go at my own expense then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing Barren be this proactive…A spark lit up in Robert’s eyes.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It seems the Daegi guild’s broadcast had its effect.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially after showing a stat increase in less than a week. Any player would want that growth rate increase effect.

 <p>
  “I can’t let that happen to someone who will become our guild’s pillar. I will reserve another slot.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, two players from our guild are going?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, but…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then tell their guild master to come here. Why do we have to go to Korea? Their guild master isn’t even an active player. For players like us, a day or two is valuable.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The direct flight from New York to Korea takes 14 hours. Including the return flight and the time spent in Korea, they wouldn’t be able to play BattleNet for at least 2 days.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially since Barren, being particular, only played games on his home BattleNet connector. If he went to Korea, he wouldn’t be able to play BattleNet at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood. I will bring up the matter.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile,
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  At the office of a Japanese trading company in Korea, located next to the Sword Palace building,
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  A space that Takeda Kazuo of the Neo Self-Defense Forces uses like his own home, there was a woman who had taken over his computer desk, yawning.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh… I’m tired of BattleTube.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dressed in a tracksuit, her face devoid of makeup. Her tied-up hair seemed greasy, as if she hadn’t washed it in days. Her skin was full of acne, and the glasses she wore made her eyes look as small as dots.
 </p>
 <p>
  “When will he come back with the food?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As her stomach growled, She pouted and spoke irritably.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon after, “I’m so, so sorry!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The door burst open, and Takeda hurried into the office.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What did you bring today?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You mentioned wanting sushi last time, so I brought some.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sushi? Why sushi in Korea? It should be eaten in our homeland. Tsk tsk.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m, I’m sorry, Goddess…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Takeda addressed the woman as “Goddess.” But she was far from the appearance of a goddess.
 </p>
 <p>
  At a glance, she resembled a typical hikikomori (a reclusive individual).
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nom! nom!… but this is quite tasty. It has a different flavor from back home…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh! Such grace! It’s an honor to hear you say that!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm. The more I eat, the tastier it gets… Takeda, did you buy this for yourself too? Can I eat it all?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course!”
 </p>
 <p>
  At the woman’s words, Takeda, who treasures food above all else, offered the sushi without hesitation.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t the first time such an event occurred; Takeda looked thinner than before. However, his eyes shone with enthusiasm, apparently encouraged by the woman’s praise.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, that was good. Now, shall we talk about the target?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. The Neo Self-Defense Forces sent a rental offer, but they seem to be rejecting it on the other side.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon is intentionally stalling the rental proposal from the Neo Self-Defense Forces.
 </p>
 <p>
  Takeda had already predicted that the offer would be declined.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… They seem to hold a grudge against us, don’t they?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems so.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We should have secured the Sword King’s daughter too along with him. Maybe thinking about her niece would’ve made our target follow us. But then, we might have failed to secure the Sword King…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The woman mumbled to herself and then quickly started typing on the computer keyboard.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  She accessed a Korean job site.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Daegi Guild is recruiting a video content editor.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Given the situation, we should infiltrate as guild staff.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the recruitment post, Takeda wiped the sweat off his forehead.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Um… pardon my rudeness, but do you know how to edit? It seems like a BattleTube editing job.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm. Of course.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She touched her face, and the acne vanished, revealing clear skin.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Editing… is my specialty, right?”
 </p>

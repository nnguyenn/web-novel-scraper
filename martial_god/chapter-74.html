  Chapter 74

 <p>
  [Translator – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  Chapter 74
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shall we now discuss the Akashic Page? Ariel.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan returned home, he mumbled.
 </p>
 <p>
  From the elbow area, a black shadow spread, revealing Ariel.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Akashic Page… It’s equipment for those with supporting gifts.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Equipment, you say?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. The Akashic Page amplifies the abilities of the supporting gifts.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel reached over to Seong Jihan’s desk.
 </p>
 <p>
  From her touch, a black energy spread, and she grabbed the Space 23 model, a gift she received after filming the advertisement.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Although it doesn’t function permanently… It’s a remarkable amplifier. It’s not just for folding and unfolding such devices.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Saying that, Ariel shook her head as if she couldn’t comprehend.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The description of the Akashic Page’s item should mention it amplifies supporting gifts. I don’t understand why it’s used for such things.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm. There was no such description.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The item description of the Akashic Page on Earth was simple.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Akashic Page (SS-grade)]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Contacts a higher-dimensional information entity.]
 </p>
 <p>
  In the past, since no one knew how to use it, the Akashic Page became a meme, getting called ‘the most useless SS-grade item’ on the internet.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan showed this to Ariel, she blinked in surprise.
 </p>
 <p>
  [No appraisal? Isn’t there a player with an appraisal gift?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “On Earth, SS-grades can’t be appraised.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the players with the appraisal gift, no one could appraise SS-grades.
 </p>
 <p>
  A minimum A-grade was required for the appraisal gift.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hmm… How many are there in the lowest-ranked species?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “About 7 billion.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [7 billion? And not a single one among them can appraise an SS-grade? Truly… they are the lowest-ranked species!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel nodded in agreement, further solidifying her belief in the equation human = lowest-ranked species.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even if they had known about it, it’s likely it would’ve been used this way. In this world, supporting gifts are rarely used. If one gets that gift, they simply live like a regular person.”
 </p>
 <p>
  But to forsake technological innovation and invest in the Akashic Page for such people?
 </p>
 <p>
  It was unthinkable for humans on Earth.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I can’t understand. There must be Dungeon Portals in this world, too. Don’t you need players with the ‘Exploration’ Gift to eliminate them?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What…? With ‘Exploration’, Dungeon Portals can be closed?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan widened his eyes at Ariel’s sudden revelation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dungeon Portals.
 </p>
 <p>
  During the current tutorial phase, they only appeared in the bottom 10% of Leagues.
 </p>
 <p>
  But after the tutorial, that percentage steadily increased.
 </p>
 <p>
  Every nation, except the final ten, got covered with Dungeon Portals and perished.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The problem with Dungeon Portals was that their complete eradication was impossible.’
 </p>
 <p>
  There were multiple attempts to close Dungeon Portals.
 </p>
 <p>
  They tried bombing them, and players attempted to destroy them with magic.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Dungeon Portals wouldn’t disappear from such external attacks.
 </p>
 <p>
  Humanity chose to enter the portals instead.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But even entering one, fully dismantling the dungeon was impossible.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if everything inside a dungeon portal was annihilated using tactical nukes,
 </p>
 <p>
  The portal would become stronger in a day and regenerate.
 </p>
 <p>
  The types of monsters coming out of these altered portals kept changing.
 </p>
 <p>
  If ghosts or similar entities emerged, that region had to be abandoned.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although attacks from Supporters or Mages did work, there were too many of them to fend off with those means alone.
 </p>
 <p>
  And now, to hear those Dungeons could be closed with the Exploration Gift…
 </p>
 <p>
  [You didn’t know? To find a dungeon core, exploration abilities are essential.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I had no idea… Supporting Gifts seems quite useful.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Right. That’s why in our world, they are highly respected. To look down on supporting Gifts, what an… intriguing world.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel shook her head as if she couldn’t fathom it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then she asked, [By the way, what’s the highest grade of the supporting Gift for the lowest-ranked species?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “The highest I’ve seen is A. Our guild master is of that grade.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [A is the highest? Then there must be many lower grades like C, D.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right.”
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  [Those grades are useless in supporting gifts… It’s only natural they’re treated like ordinary people. What about in combat?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “There are several SSS grades.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I see…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel seemed to have understood something and nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you have any suspicions or ideas?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your kind is not suited for battle. For one, they have too many vital points.]
 </p>
 <p>
  When Ariel pointed to her chest, a hole opened up there.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Even like this, a Shadow Elf doesn’t die.]
 </p>
 <p>
  She pointed to her neck, and her head floated in the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Even if only the head remains, they can survive.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Impressive.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s the survival ability of a mid-tier race. Humans, on the other hand, are so easy to kill. In terms of combat abilities, they would probably rank the lowest among the species participating in the BattleNet.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan recalled the races he had faced as enemies in the Space League.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Indeed, judging by species alone, humans were the weakest.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Humans had a much inferior basic physical ability compared to other species.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, they had many vital points, and they could die from excessive bleeding from just a few injuries.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, other species could reattach severed limbs, and some could regenerate like starfish.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially the ‘Elfs’ had vitality that even cockroaches would envy, making it unfair to be in the same league balance-wise.
 </p>
 <p>
  [So such fragile humans participated in BattleNet… To balance things out, the system must have granted them exceptional gifts. There are several who received SSS-grade gifts.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t other species get that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [No. When our star first participated in the Space League, the highest gift grade for combat roles was A.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “But they receive better supporting gifts?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. The average is B-grade, with the highest reaching SSS-grade.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded in agreement.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘She is more useful for providing information than for fighting.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel, the Shadow of the Sun, was beneficial as a summoned entity and as a shadow sword, but her knowledge of the other world was even more valuable at the moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  She can locate a dungeon core with her exploration skills…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to disclose this information later.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It would be best to immediately disclose information about dismantling Dungeon Portals for Earth’s sake.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Seong Jihan decided pragmatically that if it became known that Ariel provided this information, his life might be endangered.
 </p>
 <p>
  He’s currently treated as the world’s top prospect, but becoming a target of powerful national intelligence organizations knowing Ariel has knowledge of the otherworldly League would be dangerous.
 </p>
 <p>
  Regardless of how strong Seong Jihan is, he’s currently only in the silver league.
 </p>
 <p>
  Facing a nation-level threat would be challenging.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to release the information when I can handle the repercussions.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s still the tutorial period, so the Dungeon Portals aren’t immediately threatening the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But I need to secure the Akashic pages.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Amplifying of supporting gifts.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s something Seong Jihan, who still has a lot of growing to do, definitely needed.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he could enhance Lee Hayeon’s ‘Nurturing’ Gift, he would also benefit.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to find a way to obtain it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have been summoned to the Abyss of the Apocalypse.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You belong to the Angel Faction.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Assist the angels and conquer the Demon Faction.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Finally, the Angel Faction.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was quite pleased for the first time in a while. After entering the Silver League, he had never been in the Angel Faction in the six games he played.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ve been in the Demon Faction for four Invasions. The odds of being in the Angel Faction were 50%, but it felt like I was being rejected for breaking the Archangel’s sword.’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It was just bad luck.’
 </p>
 <p>
  On the seventh day, he finally got into the Angel Faction, giving him a chance to obtain a piece of the Death Reaper’s scythe.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, the players who were on Seong Jihan’s Angel Faction team rejoiced upon seeing him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow! It’s Seong Jihan!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Woah!!! This is my first Invasion!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m finally going to get carried…sob!”
 </p>
 <p>
  And for good reason.
 </p>
 <p>
  – So, these players are getting carried this round?
 </p>
 <p>
  – First Invasion? Silver noobs, lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Last round, all of Seong Jihan’s teammates were in the late 20s to early 30s levels, lol.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels
 </p>
 <p>
  – By now, shouldn’t he be officially recognized as ‘Solo Carry’ by BattleNet?
 </p>
 <p>
  – ㅇ~ㅇㅈ.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Even when he first started the game, Seong Jihan played amongst those who were levels 48~49.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite being in such unfavorable conditions, he continuously dominated the game, and now the teammates he encounters have changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Previously, he would meet high-level players, but now he’s paired with beginners who’ve just reached Silver Rank, level 25.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the opposing team is still around levels 40+, so excluding Seong Jihan, his team’s overall strength was significantly weaker.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Am I the only one thinking Seong Jihan can carry even level 1 players?
 </p>
 <p>
  – He can even win a 5 vs 1, why is this surprising? Lol
 </p>
 <p>
  – Exactly. Among the Silver players, who goes around Jungling?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Are you talking about Barren?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ah~ Killing jungle mobs in lane with a 200% buff?
 </p>
 <p>
  – If that’s the case, why even go Jungling? Lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers weren’t worried at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  And as expected, the game went their way.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Damn… Why am I against them?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  From the guild ‘Divergent’, who was on the same team in the first game of the Invasion,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, positioned in the mid-lane, ruthlessly pierced through the team leader’s head.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Player Seong Jihan is rampaging!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [No one can stop player Seong Jihan!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Player Seong Jihan has the blessing of the gods!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, even the system voice is all too familiar.
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers of Seong Jihan’s channel, unfazed, looked forward to his next performance.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Will he achieve a pentakill this time too?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Right. He’s done it in the Demon Faction, and I’ve heard he’ll challenge it when he’s in the Angel Faction.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Isn’t Seong Jihan’s sword of the same attribute, so it probably won’t deal much damage to similar attributes, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  – Don’t doubt it, of course, he’ll do it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  And soon, as the viewers anticipated, the game proceeded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow… the feeling of being carried… it’s even better than a Maybach.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [TL/N: Getting carried in Korea is called riding the bus, whereas the one driving the bus is the one who’s carrying the team. So, Maybach here is referring to how riding this ‘bus’ is even better than his Maybach.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just Maybach? It’s better than riding in a Rolls Royce.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah! I totally agree. Since we’re noobs, maybe he can carry us again next time…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s low-level teammates casually chatted and enjoyed the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I thought we agreed not to encounter each other…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I wish I was on Seong Jihan’s team!!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I won’t get pentakilled!!!!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll just stay stuck in the jungle.”
 </p>
 <p>
  To avoid the humiliation of a pentakill, the enemy team players didn’t defend their base, instead, they hid in the jungle.
 </p>
 <p>
  – They aren’t even defending their base. Lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  – They’re not even in the well.
 </p>
 <p>
  – The pentakill video was immortalized on BattleTube Lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  – It’s interesting they thought of hiding in the jungle Lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ah, this isn’t a big deal.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ‘Sanctuary Pentakill’ Achievement.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although he had achieved it during the first game, there was no additional achievement point for doing it again.
 </p>
 <p>
  So there was no need for a pentakill; he could just attack the protective barrier at the Demon’s Sanctuary and clash with the Grim Reaper’s scythe.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But there might be another hidden achievement.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan stopped advancing towards the Demon Faction and began searching the jungle.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nameless Divine Arts Footwork Technique: Flashing Sky Thunder Steps
 </p>
 <p>
  “How… How did you find us?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  It didn’t take him long to locate players when he only searched areas not dominated by jungle monsters.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright, everyone. Let’s go to the well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, players froze in place as they were attacked, their health points dropping rapidly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan levitated them with Force and carried them as he searched for other Demon Faction players.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There was one at the base, so you’re the last one. Four of you hiding… impressive.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please… I didn’t want to be immortalized on BattleTube… Can’t you just let us win?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who had discovered the opposing team’s leader last, nonchalantly drained their health points while ignoring their cries
 </p>
 <p>
  “This will get you even more immortalized.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Carrying the four players, Seong Jihan arrived at the enemy base.
 </p>
 <p>
  In that state, he said, “Safe travels.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He then shoved all four players into the sanctuary.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a thud, the four players stacked up.
 </p>
 <p>
  When one more player, who had been resting in the sanctuary, joined, all five were gathered at the well.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a sly smile, Seong Jihan said, “Let’s go for the pentakill, shall we?”
 </p>

  Chapter 75
 </h3>
 <p>
  [Translator – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  Chapter 75
 </p>
 <p>
  – They got completely crushed, LOL.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Look at that obsession to pull off a pentakill. Unbelievable!
 </p>
 <p>
  – He could have killed them outside, but he chose to throw them into the sanctuary, LOL.
 </p>
 <p>
  – The way they hid was impressive, but finding and dragging them out? Legendary!
 </p>
 <p>
  In the Valley of the End, where teams fiercely battle 5v5, one player soared around capturing and tossing every enemy into the sanctuary.
 </p>
 <p>
  Such a scene was beyond belief.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, if that player was Seong Jihan, it made all the sense in the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwish!
 </p>
 <p>
  From Seong Jihan’s left hand, Eclipse extended, with a brilliant white current wrapping around it.
 </p>
 <p>
  His next target? The Demon faction’s protective shield.
 </p>
 <p>
  A thunder-based attack was the most effective against it but…
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwish!
 </p>
 <p>
  The brilliant current on the blade was weakening the power of the shadows.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, Eclipse isn’t at a level to harness the power of thunder yet. It will only have a negative effect.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, it still doesn’t work.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [At SSS-grade, it can enhance all attributes, but for now, only darkness can be strengthened.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Enhancing all attributes at SSS-grade, impressive.
 </p>
 <p>
  But for now, the contradiction between his shadow blade Eclipse and the power of thunder was an unavoidable fact.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan sheathed his blade, pulling out the Phoenix’s Arrow from his inventory.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Only three throws left.’
 </p>
 <p>
  During the Shadow Queen quest, he used the Phoenix’s Arrow twice.
 </p>
 <p>
  After three more throws, the item would vanish.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he wanted to continuously use the item like a spear, he’d need to deliberately avoid throwing it, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There’s no need to be so frugal.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was handy so far, but it’s just an A-grade item.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he grows, better items will be required, so there’s no need to be too attached.
 </p>
 <p>
  Using it when he can was for the best.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwish!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Phoenix’s Arrow was engulfed by the white current.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike with Eclipse, the Phoenix’s Arrow, which contained the power of fire, was a good match for the thunder.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon, the spear was enveloped in a radiant energy, blazing fiercely.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Death Reaper greatly senses the threat to the Demon’s Sanctuary!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Death Reaper summons the flames of death!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as lightning struck when he attacked the Angel’s sanctuary; dark flames erupted around Seong Jihan’s feet as he targeted the Demon’s Sanctuary.
 </p>
 <p>
  The dark flames seemed as if they’d swallow him up, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  Nameless Divine Arts, Footwork Technique: Flashing Sky Thunder Steps
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s body soared high into the sky, out of reach from the rising flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  Leveraging his power, Seong Jihan, hovering in the sky, ignited the Phoenix’s Arrow with fury.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon, an intense power that wasn’t fully contained within the Phoenix’s Arrow ran wild, with white currents and flames intertwining.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Death Reaper reinforces the sanctuary’s protection!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Death Reaper’s scythe directly protects the sanctuary!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps sensing the dangerous energy, the Death Reaper’s scythe that protected the Demon Faction proactively flew towards the sanctuary.
 </p>
 <p>
  This situation alone was testament to how powerful Seong Jihan’s attack was.
 </p>
 <p>
  He watched the currents, which couldn’t be fully contained in the Phoenix’s Arrow, as they shot in every direction.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s still hard to control completely.’
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the three Nameless Divine Arts, Divine Thunder Decree.
 </p>
 <p>
  While its destructive power was unmatched, it was a difficult skill to control.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially now, using it without the backing of the Nameless Divine Arts made it even more challenging.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But it’s easier than when I was at Bronze.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Maybe because his ability had improved significantly since level 25, he was able to better control the thunder power spreading in all directions.

 <p>
  Seong Jihan concentrated his energy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nameless Divine Arts, Divine Thunder Decree – Striking Thunderbolt
 </p>
 <p>
  A phoenix’s cry falling from the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  The thunder it carried turned into a massive lightning bolt.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Death Reaper uses a special move to prevent the humiliation of the sanctuary.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Death Reaper’s scythe strengthens the sanctuary.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Even before the lightning touched, had it been predicted that this couldn’t be stopped?
 </p>
 <p>
  The system message that the Reaper’s scythe had divided appeared before Seong Jihan’s eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even so.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sssssk!
 </p>
 <p>
  When the dark protective barrier was temporarily pierced, the bodies of the five players inside were all burnt to a char.
 </p>
 <p>
  The giant wall of lightning was momentarily pierced by the Death Reaper’s scythe and blocked.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the players inside couldn’t withstand that brief burst of power.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Pentakill!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Player Seong Jihan has achieved a Pentakill!]
 </p>
 <p>
  More overwhelming power than when he encountered the Archangel’s protection.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was possible because Seong Jihan’s level had increased by 5 since then, and he used the Divine Thunder Decree, one of the three Nameless Divine Arts, which was the most powerful.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have acquired a fragment of the Death Reaper’s Scythe.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s a quest item. It will be stored automatically in the inventory.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have cleared the linked quest – Trace of the Apostle (1).]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have received a reward of 20,000 achievement points.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The linked quest continues to Trace of the Apostle (2).]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I finally did it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan lightly smiled and checked the linked quest content.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Linked Quest – Trace of the Apostle(2)]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Apostle, belonging to neither light nor dark, watches the clash of the two factions, hiding beneath a deep lake.
 </p>
 <p>
  The cunning apostle, ‘Viscount Nasheed’, will act upon seeing the weapons of the Archangel and the Death Reaper break.
 </p>
 <p>
  Throw both the fragments into the lake to pull the Viscount out of the lake and subdue him.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Reward: Veil of Void / Achievement points 50,000]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Warning: If you get promoted from the Silver League, this quest will disappear.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Subdue Viscount Nasheed?” Seong Jihan was incredulous after checking the linked quest.
 </p>
 <p>
  The rewards were impressive.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  Just like when he cleared the Shadow Queen related quest, there was a reward of 50,000 achievement points.
 </p>
 <p>
  The reward, ‘Veil of Void’, also seemed exceptional.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, there was a reason for such generosity.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Viscount Nasheed… is a monster that Platinum Rank players hunt in groups.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Starting from level 100, the Platinum League.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Viscount Nasheed was a monster that five players in this league could only hunt after receiving full buffs in the valley.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, the quest reward was generous because he was being asked to defeat a monster that normally required five Platinum players, all on his own.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s impossible to defeat him right now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan assessed the situation rationally.
 </p>
 <p>
  To defeat Viscount Nasheed, he would need more power than he currently possessed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll have to try when I’m close to level 50.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking he should level up more for now, Seong Jihan watched the Demon Faction explode.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have achieved a Pentakill in both factions’ sanctuaries.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have cleared the hidden quest, ‘Total Domination’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have received 30,000 achievement points.]
 </p>
 <p>
  From both the Angel and Demon factions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rewards for achieving a Pentakill in both came in.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This game was very profitable.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan smiled contentedly and logged out.
 </p>

 <p>
  The America First Guild’s private plane landed there.
 </p>
 <p>
  Two blonde Caucasians, a man and a woman, disembarked.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
 </p>
 <p>
  Both were tall with striking appearances, instantly noticeable.
 </p>
 <p>
  Snap! Snap!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh… They really came.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Barren and Sophia, did they really come to join a major guild?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Two from America First… So that’s 10 billion won a month?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Considering they’re nurturing promising talents, it’s cheap.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The reporters conversed amongst themselves, taking pictures of the two prospects.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though both were still in the Silver League.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having the SSS-class Gift and SS-class Gift made them widely known in the BattleNet industry, worthy of media attention.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking at the barrage of camera flashes, Barren frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Damn… Even in a country like this, they’re taking photos of me? How did they find out? Did Seong send them?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia, who overheard him, blinked her blue eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Barren. Do you really think Seong would do that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He might. Think about it, the Guild Master could’ve just come to the U.S., but why did they specifically call us here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Robert Gates had politely requested the guild master to visit the U.S.
 </p>
 <p>
  He even promised considerable additional rewards on top of the regular GP payment for the lease agreement.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I heard that the female Guild Master had a very positive attitude toward the U.S. business trip. Her travel expenses were significant.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But Seong told the guild master not to go?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Why do you think? It’s all to hold back my growth.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What a delusion.”
 </p>
 <p>
  To any observer, it was clear Barren was the one overly conscious of Seong Jihan, whereas it seemed Seong didn’t care as much.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia chose not to voice her thoughts.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shit. There’s only one limousine?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha. Is this the standard for Korean limousines? So cramped.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is the only alcohol they have? I can’t drink this cheap stuff.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even after leaving the airport and during the limousine ride, Barren constantly voiced his complaints.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia, unable to bear his incessant grumbling, took out her tablet PC.
 </p>
 <p>
  With wireless earphones in, she logged into BattleTube.
 </p>
 <p>
  She noticed a new video uploaded to a channel she is subscribed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong… He’s playing the game now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The player, Seong Jihan, first came to her attention during a ‘Top 100’ match.
 </p>
 <p>
  The very game in which he defeated Barren in a single move.
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon seeing Seong’s gameplay, Sophia was unexpectedly captivated by him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s so thrilling…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  She always had a preference for front-line Warriors over Mages or Archers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching Seong single-handedly dominate the game, she was utterly smitten.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were, of course, many players more potent than Seong Jihan currently.
 </p>
 <p>
  But none dominated their respective leagues as Seong did.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a bang, Seong destroyed a jungle monster in a single strike.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia exclaimed softly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The way Seong would overpower any adversary in one go was thrilling.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even blockbuster movies had moments of crisis, but Seong’s channel was devoid of such episodes.
 </p>
 <p>
  His gameplay was the epitome of adrenaline rush, exactly to Sophia’s taste.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Tsk…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren, noticing Sophia’s engrossed gaze on Seong’s channel, looked displeased.
 </p>
 <p>
  He believed those admiring glances should be directed at him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ever since Seong burst onto the scene in the Top 100 matches, everything seemed to tilt out of favor for Barren.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh my God…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia’s continuous exclamations were getting to him.
 </p>
 <p>
  In frustration, Barren gulped down the very champagne he had earlier labeled as ‘cheap’.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He beckons me all the way to Korea… and he’s just playing games?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren, convinced that Seong invited him to Korea solely to rival and overshadow him, fueled his resolve.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Once I join the guild, I’ll quickly turn things around…!’
 </p>
 <p>
  He continued to drink, not setting down the bottle until the limousine reached Sword Palace.
 </p>

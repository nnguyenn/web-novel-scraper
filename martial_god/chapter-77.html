  Chapter 77
 </h3>
 <p>
  [Translator – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  Chapter 77
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the guild master’s office after Barren left.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon looked towards the door and said, “It seems Barren is quite conscious of you, Owner.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems so. He should focus on improving his skills.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In his previous life, Barren ranked higher than Seong Jihan, hence he didn’t act like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, he visibly exhibited signs of an inferiority complex.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, he was once considered one of the world’s top prospects, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “To that guy, an SSS-grade Gift is like pearls before swine.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan harshly criticized Barren’s abilities,
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon sneakily checked outside the guild master’s office door.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘… He left, right?’
 </p>
 <p>
  “When will the other players arrive?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They should be here by tomorrow or the day after. Oh, speaking of which, where should we use the nurturing fee we received from the player loan?”
 </p>
 <p>
  When they take care of 5 players, they receive a total nurturing fee of 25 million GP a month, equivalent to 250 billion won.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘With that much, I could even buy an A-grade relic.’
 </p>
 <p>
  To absorb divine power and gain force, he needs to collect A-grade Otherworldly Relics.
 </p>
 <p>
  The price of an A-grade relic starts from 2.5 billion won. He wasn’t been able to purchase them due to financial constraints, but now,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can surely buy now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Now that he had the money, it was essential to purchase and absorb even a little more of the attributes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm… According to my share, I’ll allocate 20 billion. Is that okay?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, why consider shares? It’s your guild, use all of it if you want.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can’t do that. We need funds for guild operations.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Operating expenses… We barely have any significant expenses now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No. You said you wanted to grow the guild, so please use it as you see fit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After all, this money is almost entirely earned thanks to Lee Hayeon’s Gift.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan gave 20% of it to Lee Hayeon to use as she pleased.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh my, you really… You didn’t have to do this…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Unaware of this, Lee Hayeon looked at Seong Jihan with eyes filled with emotion.
 </p>
 <p>
  Giving her 5 billion to spend.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s too generous!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anyway, now that we have the money, shall I try and multiply it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “By multiplying… You mean…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have a sure bet, just like last time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s no need to spend all 20 billion on A-grade relics.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially when there’s a sure bet.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Betting… really?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  At those words, Lee Hayeon’s eyes sparkled.
 </p>
 <p>
  She had been so busy with guild duties that her gambler’s passion was suppressed.
 </p>
 <p>
  But with Seong Jihan mentioning a sure thing, her hands itched once again.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Ah… I decided not to gamble… But maybe I can just recover my principal this time?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The biggest reason gambling addicts can’t escape the trap:
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking of ‘just recovering their principal’.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon had already become a splendid gambler.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. This time, don’t use your head unnecessarily. Just follow my bet exactly. Understand?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course! From now on, I’ll only trust and follow you, Ownerr!”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s advice, Lee Hayeon immediately nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  She had already lost money twice by acting impulsively.
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, Lee Hayeon firmly resolved to trust and follow only Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘She seems committed now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  She won’t make a mistake this time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan began in earnest,
 </p>
 <p>
  “You know that the East Asia League’s second half of the season is until December, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course, I do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who do you think will win?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Umm… China, perhaps? Japan has become stronger with the addition of the Sword King. But the original first place has its strength, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No. Japan will win with a clean sweep in the second half of the season.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A clean sweep?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon Seong Jihan’s assertion, Lee Hayeon’s eyes widened.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was understandable that Japan would rank first.
 </p>
 <p>
  The power of the Sword King was that immense.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, a clean sweep was a different story.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">

 <p>
  They would be facing China, which has consistently been the top in the East Asian League, four times.
 </p>
 <p>
  Would Japan win all those matches?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘China has two players with SSS-grade gifts…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon couldn’t believe it.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, everything he had said up to now had been correct.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, this time, she decided to trust and follow.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Also,”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Also?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Our country will have a total loss.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A total loss?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  “The absence of the Sword King was a significant loss. Who can our country beat now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  With the absence of the Sword King, South Korea couldn’t secure even a single win in this year’s second half of the regional league matches.
 </p>
 <p>
  But still… Not a single win until December?
 </p>
 <p>
  Granted, China and Japan are strong, but not even against Eastern Russia or Taiwan?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Russia has concentrated its players in the western part, so the eastern forces should be weak…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Russia, with its vast territory, participated in the regional league divided into two regions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Western Russia, which included Europe and was more significant, had most of the skilled players, while the East had slightly less skilled players.
 </p>
 <p>
  Therefore, when ranking in the East Asian League, China was the dominant top team.
 </p>
 <p>
  Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Russia were all competing closely.
 </p>
 <p>
  But not even beating Russia or Taiwan once, even with the absence of the Sword King?
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s… hard to believe.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, I don’t know if I become a national representative. I won’t be able to participate in the second half of the season due to my level. South Korea will lose everything.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan affirmed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, bet on Japan’s clean sweep victory and Korea’s total loss.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So you’re suggesting to bet separately for each match?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. As time goes on, Japan’s victories and Korea’s defeats will become commonplace. The odds won’t be that high, but with compound interest, it grows.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if the odds are just 1.2 times, getting it right 10 times will multiply the money over 6 times.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I must bet according to the Owner’s words this time!’ This time, don’t ‘think’.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Just blindly follow! ‘
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon made this promise to herself several times.
 </p>
 <p>

 <p>
  [The Daegi Guild, the world’s first nurturing guild unveiled! The monthly rent is a whopping 5 billion won!?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Two people with SSS-grade Gift and three people with SS-grade Gift joined the Daegi Guild. Players representing the next generation have all gathered.]Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  [5 billion won rent controversy… Experts unanimously rate it a cheap amount. “It will be higher next time.”]
 </p>
 <p>
  The five promising members all joined the Daegi Guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  The media gave this a lot of coverage.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though it hadn’t been a month since it was created, the Daegi Guild was smoothly sailing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, it wasn’t only the guild that was thriving.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Seong Jihan, rapid progress to Level 40! An unprecedented leveling pace!!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Can he reach the Gold Promotion Match in just a month? All eyes on him.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Seong Jihan continues his streak of 1st places. When will this record end?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, the owner of the guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since advancing to Silver, he was showing results no different from when he was in Bronze…
 </p>
 <p>
  No, he was even giving a crazier performance, almost sweeping the entire league.
 </p>
 <p>
  – These days, it’s so fun watching Seong Jihan
 </p>
 <p>
  – When will he reach Diamond Rank… Please join the national team soon ㅠㅠ
 </p>
 <p>
  – Isn’t the national team on a 7-game losing streak now?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Yeah, Japan has a 7-game winning streak lol
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ugh, our national ranking is gonna drop; isn’t a dungeon going to appear?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Don’t worry, Seong Jihan will join the national team before that.
 </p>
 <p>
  After Sword King left, the South Korean national team continued its losing streak in the East Asian League.
 </p>
 <p>
  With only depressing news from the Korean BattleNet scene, news about Seong Jihan was nothing less than a beacon of hope.
 </p>
 <p>
  But as people put more hope in Seong Jihan, there were also those who were getting more displeased.
 </p>
 <p>
  [BattleNet Director Kim Namtae expresses his intention to resign.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Speculations of an effective dismissal due to a petition at the Blue House surpassing 500,000 signatures.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What a mess.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The CEO of the Korea Daily frowned upon reading the article.
 </p>
 <p>
  BattleNet Director Kim Namtae.
 </p>
 <p>
  He wasn’t the type to step down easily.
 </p>
 <p>
  The position of the director, though recently established, was one where a lot of influence regarding BattleNet lay.
 </p>
 <p>
  Only politicians with strong influence could get to such a position.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Someone who managed to make Kim Namtae voluntarily resign in such a short time could only be…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…The president.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In this era, he understood that BattleNet players were important.
 </p>
 <p>
  But for the president to intervene and dismiss a politician just because of Seong Jihan, who’s merely in Silver League…
 </p>
 <p>
  It was an unbelievable situation, but it already happened.
 </p>
 <p>
  The CEO of the Korea Daily picked up the phone.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Put an apology letter on the front page of tomorrow’s newspaper.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [An apology, sir?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Why are you asking again? It’s about Seong Jihan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […Understood, sir.]
 </p>
 <p>
  With Kim Namtae dismissed, the focus of public sentiment would now be on the Korea Daily.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though he didn’t want to post an apology, he had no choice.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Contact the Daegi Guild and ask if we can use Seong Jihan as an advertising model. Somehow secure a reservation. We have to let the world know we’re not against him.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Understood…]
 </p>
 <p>
  SLAM!
 </p>
 <p>
  The chairman slammed down the phone, grinding his teeth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having to apologize to the player, who was essentially the reason for the boycott against the Korea Daily, and begging him to shoot an ad for their newspaper…
 </p>
 <p>
  It felt like a cruel joke.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘These kids…! They can’t even apologize properly, making such a mess…!’
 </p>
 <p>
  The chairman spent some time fuming.
 </p>
 <p>
  He resolved not to let his grandson and granddaughter, who caused this mess in the first place, off the hook.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  Mid-September.
 </p>
 <p>
  Continuing his streak and reaching Level 40, Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though the BattleNet Director got fired and the Korea Daily posted an apology,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who already lost interest in them, was, as always, focusing only on his growth.
 </p>
 <p>
  As usual, right after 12 am, he logged into the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Welcome to the Silver League – Gangnam Area.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [This mission is Defense.]
 </p>
 <p>
  […….]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What’s this?’
 </p>
 <p>
  This time playing the game, he experienced a ‘loading’ screen, something he had never seen before.
 </p>
 <p>
  Also, the system messages displayed upon entering the game were visible to BattleTube viewers.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, the viewers were equally intrigued by this unfamiliar phenomenon.
 </p>
 <p>
  – ??What is this?? What’s happening now!?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Does BattleNet lag too?
 </p>
 <p>
  – If it’s defense, there should be 10 towers, so why is it like this?
 </p>
 <p>
  – No matching opponent? LOL
 </p>
 <p>
  The Silver League shares its game map with Bronze.
 </p>
 <p>
  The only difference between Silver and Bronze was the addition of the ‘Invasion’ mode and a new Valley of the End map.
 </p>
 <p>
  Everything else, regarding the game map structure, was identical to Bronze. But then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Defense game is assigned to the ‘Lone Bridge’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  After a lengthy loading time, the system message announced a completely different map.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Huh?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Lone Bridge?
 </p>
 <p>
  – The Chibi map?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Isn’t this a Gold League map?
 </p>
 <p>
  A single bridge.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s a map used in the Gold League.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because the dynamics of the game are similar to the Battle of Chibi in Romance of the Three Kingdoms, it’s often referred to as “Chibi.”
 </p>
 <p>
  But how was Seong Jihan, a Silver player, assigned to this map?
 </p>
 <p>
  The system then explained the reason.
 </p>
 <p>
  [We can’t find a suitable opponent for you in the current league.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The player will be matched with opponents from a higher league.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [As a participation reward for being in a lower league, you will receive an additional 50% GP &amp; XP bonus.]
 </p>
 <p>
  – Crazy! Was this even possible?
 </p>
 <p>
  – I’ve been watching BattleNet for about 10 years, and this is a first;
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ah… so after ranking 1st about 40 times, you play against higher leagues… LOL.
 </p>
 <p>
  – So, a Silver is playing against Gold LOL
 </p>
 <p>
  – Will Jihan’s 1st place record be broken here? ㅠㅠ
 </p>
 <p>
  A matchmaking system he hadn’t seen even in his previous life. Although Seong Jihan was taken aback by this unprecedented event, internally, he felt delighted.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s great.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially since leveling up was becoming more challenging, getting an XP boost like that was indeed a blessing.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I get 1st place here… I might earn more achievement points too.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With high hopes and a smile, Seong Jihan entered the Gold League’s Defense game map: ‘One Bridge’.
 </p>

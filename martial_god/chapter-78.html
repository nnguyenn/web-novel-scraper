 <p>
  Chapter 78
 </p>
 <p>
  The defense map, ‘Lone Bridge’.
 </p>
 <p>
  This map, which appears in games from Gold to Diamond League, was notorious for its extreme difficulty.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially for newly-promoted Gold players, the objective was less about stopping the enemies and more about mere survival.
 </p>
 <p>
  The goal was to outlive other players even by just a few minutes, to stay within the top 50 percent.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s been a while since I’ve seen this map.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan felt a rush of nostalgia.
 </p>
 <p>
  In his previous life, ‘Lone Bridge’ was among the maps he played most frequently.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, he was more familiar with the strategies for this game than anyone else.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The objective of this game is simple.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The goal was to defend the bridge, preventing enemies from crossing.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan looked around, he saw that the 50 players summoned to this map were all clustered at the starting point of the bridge.
 </p>
 <p>
  All of them looked at Seong Jihan in confusion.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Why is he here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “When did Seong Jihan move up to Gold?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I haven’t heard anything about that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is it a bug?”
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the first time a Silver player had participated in a Gold game, so their ignorance was understandable.
 </p>
 <p>
  But since they also interacted with viewers through BattleTube, they soon understood the situation via the audience.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Um… they’re saying it’s because there weren’t any matching opponents, so he got matched with a higher league?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow, that’s unbelievable! All our guild party members are level 60s… So, BattleNet evaluates Seong Jihan at that level?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seriously, there’s a big difference between Gold and Silver…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Some Gold players frowned, seemingly unhappy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gold and Silver might be just one tier apart, but this distinction determined whether one was a professional player or not.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No matter how strong Seong Jihan is, how can a Silver participate in a Gold game?’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I hope he doesn’t become a liability.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Due to Seong Jihan’s immense popularity, especially with the live broadcast on BattleTube, players couldn’t voice their concerns outright.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nevertheless, many harbored feelings of discomfort.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, where is Seong Jihan assigned?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s random, but since he’s Silver, shouldn’t he be in the back?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, that would be unfair. He should be treated as an equal Gold player and placed fairly, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As players debated about Seong Jihan’s placement, a loud voice rang out, “Enough of this noise!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The gigantic bridge vibrated, and from the other side, a thunderous roar echoed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The earth-shattering cry caused the players to clutch their ears and wince.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, we haven’t even started yet. Let’s chat a bit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He’s really short-tempered.”
 </p>
 <p>
  THUD! THUD!
 </p>
 <p>
  In the middle of the massive cloud bridge spanning between two cliffs, a figure approached.
 </p>
 <p>
  No, it wasn’t just a person—it was more apt to call him a giant.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even several people combined wouldn’t match his size.
 </p>
 <p>
  The approaching giant, clad in blood-stained armor, emanated a terrifying aura.
 </p>
 <p>
  “While the gatekeeper fights alone in the front, you soldiers are gossiping at the back!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Imperial Gatekeeper, the Giant Bijang, quickly approached the players and leaned in close, showing his face that was fitting for his over 4-meter tall body.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Eeek!
 </p>
 <p>
  – He’s seriously ugly every time I see him.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Feels like he’ll appear in my dreams lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Please don’t shove that double chin in our faces;;;
 </p>
 <p>
  Among humanoid NPCs, he had the worst visuals.
 </p>
 <p>
  His face was crinkled with wrinkles.
 </p>
 <p>
  Random sprouts of hair jutted from his face, with dark warts scattered around.
 </p>
 <p>
  His nose, mouth, and chin were weirdly twisted.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had a few strands of hair on his balding head that made one wonder why he didn’t just shave it all off.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You weaklings! You’re not fit to fight alongside me!”
 </p>

 <p>
  After glancing at the players, Bijang stomped on the cloud bridge with his foot.
 </p>
 <p>
  The force sent all players flying towards the nearby cliff edge.
 </p>
 <p>
  – They always get kicked away.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Kya!~~ ㅇㅇ Our Gatekeeper is on another level, not even treating Gold Leaguers as people~~
 </p>
 <p>
  – Are you able to fight together on the bridge starting from the Diamond League?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Maybe possible if they’re level 150?
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  The defense map, “Lone Bridge.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Contrary to the map’s name, only players of a certain caliber could stand on the bridge.
 </p>
 <p>
  By ‘certain caliber,’ it refers to players who have reached the level where they passed the Titan’s formidable test.
 </p>
 <p>
  Such a level was unthinkable for those in the Gold tier.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a result, Gold players had to fend off flying monsters with soldiers positioned on the edge of the cliffs.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please, a good spot! Please, a good spot!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… entering the sacred grounds just to be assigned to a bad place?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just get within the top 50%!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Players flying, praying for the best spot allocation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among them, no one resisted or endured the Gatekeeper’s leg sweep.
 </p>
 <p>
  Being Gold, it was a natural course of events.
 </p>
 <p>
  But then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “You… what are you doing?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Only one remained.
 </p>
 <p>
  While everyone else soared, he stood still, defending his spot with a relaxed smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  – ?? What are you doing?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ah, Jihan! You shouldn’t stay there.
 </p>
 <p>
  – If you stay on the bridge, you’ll definitely come last ㅠㅠㅠㅠ.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers poured chats towards Jihan, who resisted the Gatekeeper’s sweep and stayed on the bridge.
 </p>
 <p>
  Most reactions were of disbelief, wondering why he made that choice.
 </p>
 <p>
  – HAHA! He’s really done for this time.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Will we finally be able to see his status window?
 </p>
 <p>
  – I thought hitting 1 million subscribers would come first! He’s finally losing the top spot!ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels
 </p>
 <p>
  – Even for Jihan, this seems unplanned.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Who would’ve imagined a Silver playing in a Gold map?
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers believed Jihan resisted the sweep because he didn’t understand the map.
 </p>
 <p>
  But in reality,
 </p>
 <p>
  Jihan, who knew the map better than anyone, had a reason to stay on the bridge.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Epic Quest]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Earn the recognition of the Imperial Gatekeeper and prevent his death.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Reward: 50,000 achievement points / Thundercloud Spear.]
 </p>
 <p>
  He received an epic quest with an incredible reward.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The achievement points are good, but the Thundercloud Spear as a reward…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Thundercloud Spear was the Gatekeeper’s exclusive weapon, used to sweep away hordes of enemies like fallen leaves.
 </p>
 <p>
  A weapon of at least SS-grade.
 </p>
 <p>
  And they’re offering this?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Eclipse is a good weapon, but it’s not compatible with the lighting. The Thundercloud Spear will be a perfect match. I must get it no matter what.’
 </p>
 <p>
  To do so, he first needs to stay on this bridge.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a relaxed face, Jihan spoke to the challenging Gatekeeper,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Gatekeeper, don’t you need someone to assist you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha! You think you can?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Gatekeeper smirked incredulously.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, soon, a sly smile appeared on his lips.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well then, try handling this!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whizz!
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, the spear tied to the Gatekeeper’s back flew towards Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Given its enormous size, akin to a utility pole, it seemed Jihan would be crushed.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Is he dead already?
 </p>
 <p>
  – No, Jihan ㅠㅠㅠ

 </div>
 <p>
  – You need at least level 150 to pass the Gatekeeper’s test HAHA! This is a total fail HAHA!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Let’s check the status~~~
 </p>
 <p>
  Even the mighty Jihan, viewers believed, couldn’t pass this brutish test.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this enough?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jihan effortlessly caught the spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t even a close call.
 </p>
 <p>
  As if exchanging items, he just lifted it up with one hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  – What is this?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wasn’t that spear something you could barely lift only with a strength of 100?
 </p>
 <p>
  – What the heck is this buff!!!! Let’s really check the status windowㅜㅜ
 </p>
 <p>
  Those more knowledgeable about BattleNet than ordinary viewers got even more excited by the display of strength casually shown by Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because the Thundercloud Spear was so heavy, only those warriors who completely maxed out on strength stats could pass that test.
 </p>
 <p>
  – If you’re watching without subscribing, please subscribe!!!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Now it’s only a million left…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even Bijang seemed surprised by Seong Jihan’s unexpected strength, eyes widening.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Heh…! You’re strong. But do you think the Thundercloud Spear will recognize you so easily?”
 </p>
 <p>
  His expression still showed displeasure.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Bijang does not like the player.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Thundercloud Spear, following its master’s will, will further test the player.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzzzz…!
 </p>
 <p>
  A tremendous electric current surged from the huge spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  The intense electricity encapsulated in the Thundercloud Spear tried to engulf Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Eh? Why another test?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Maybe because he passed too easily?
 </p>
 <p>
  – If he passed easily, they should just move on. Why torment him again?
 </p>
 <p>
  Even with Bijang’s unpredictable additional test,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Here we go again.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In his past life, having experienced Bijang’s whims frequently, Seong Jihan absorbed the electricity with ease using his Heavenly Thunder Arts.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the electricity that tried to incinerate Seong Jihan was completely neutralized, the surge from the spear soon subsided.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Player Seong Jihan has passed the test.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the passing message, Bijang still couldn’t hide his displeasure.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Heh…! You seem to have some skill. But you look just like a woman, so fragile!”
 </p>
 <p>
  – A woman?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Seong Jihan??
 </p>
 <p>
  – He’s handsome, but not the pretty boy type…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Right, more of a rugged, handsome man. Calling him fragile is a bit… lololol
 </p>
 <p>
  – Bijang always picks fights with good-looking players. Lololol
 </p>
 <p>
  – In other words, he’s just jealous?
 </p>
 <p>
  – LOL
 </p>
 <p>
  Bijang, the Imperial Gatekeeper.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among humanoid NPCs in BattleNet, just going by appearance, he was probably within the top 5 ugliest.
 </p>
 <p>
  He’d always start arguments unnecessarily whenever a good-looking player came around.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That’s why his nickname later became the Handsome Detector.’
 </p>
 <p>
  During the tutorial period, this characteristic of Bijang wasn’t widely known.
 </p>
 <p>
  But as time passed, players not picked on by Bijang actually felt left out.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Heh! You! Take the spear and follow me!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Spitting on the ground, Bijang turned and walked away.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan frowned at the sight of the obviously irritated man.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘In my past life, it didn’t matter if Bijang disliked me… but this time I need his approval, and that’s a problem.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Before, whenever Bijang would pick a fight, rather than feeling bad, it made him feel proud.
 </p>
 <p>
  But this time, it was different.
 </p>
 <p>
  He needed Bijang’s approval to complete the epic quest.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘For now… shall I proceed with the game?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan took the Thundercloud Spear, which had now conveniently shrunk to fit his hand, and followed Bijang.

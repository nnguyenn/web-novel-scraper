  Chapter 79
 </h3>
 <p>
  [Translator – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  Chapter 79
 </p>
 <p>
  In the middle of the Lone Bridge.
 </p>
 <p>
  The bridge, wide enough for dozens of people to walk side by side, was filled with the corpses of numerous monsters that had been defeated from all sides.
 </p>
 <p>
  The number easily surpassed a thousand.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was the result of Bijang’s efforts.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Phew… Bijang is strong.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Gave up his looks for power, huh? LOL
 </p>
 <p>
  – Did he even gain any power? Seems like he just lost his looks. LOL
 </p>
 <p>
  – Why the sudden jab? Why pick a fight?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wasn’t talking to you… If you’re offended, my bad… lol!
 </p>
 <p>
  Bijang, who had proven his strength to the viewers, still scowled whenever he saw Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a nonchalant flick of his finger, he shouted, “Hey! Parasite! Throw me the spear!”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Do they have parasites in this world too?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite Bijang’s irritating comment, Seong Jihan casually tossed him the Thundercloud Spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  When he threw the spear, it returned to its original size, making it considerably heavy.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, this wasn’t much of a constraint for Seong Jihan, who already possessed substantial strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bijang, now in his giant form, caught the enlarged Thundercloud Spear and, with a serious expression, planted it on the Lone Bridge.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thundercloud Seventh Form, Heavenly Net Thunder Formation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Rumble! Rumble!
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, lightning struck from the once somber sky, targeting the spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Thundercloud Spear, planted on the bridge, lost its spear form and transformed into a massive chunk of lightning, which was then absorbed into the Lone Bridge.
 </p>
 <p>
  During this time, with a smirk, Bijang warned Seong Jihan, “Survive if you can.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzzt…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon, lightning began to spiral around the center of the enormous Lone Bridge, illuminating the bridge with its glowing blue light.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash! Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  Bright clusters of light burst out from around Bijang.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before they knew it, seven lightning spears were formed on the bridge.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was Bijang’s most outstanding martial skill in a battle against many.
 </p>
 <p>
  The effect of Heavenly Net Thunder Formation was to dominate a specific area with electricity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, Seong Jihan observed Bijang’s show of strength with a somber expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He can’t control his power…’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Or doesn’t want to?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The lightning from the Heavenly Net Thunder Formation spread rapidly, even towards where Seong Jihan was standing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Blue sparks flared up, showing no mercy, even if he was an ally.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed as though they’d capture Seong Jihan the moment he showed any vulnerability.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Does he hate me even more now?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Normally, he wouldn’t have spread the Heavenly Net Thunder Formation where a player was.
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, it was too much.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if Bijang disliked him, this act was overly hostile.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, amidst these thoughts, Seong Jihan deployed a perfectly suited martial art.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nameless Divine Arts, Divine Thunder Decree – Lightning BodyÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzzt…!
 </p>
 <p>
  Sparks began to rise from Seong Jihan’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Lightning Body was essential to master the Divine Thunder Decree.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon, the lightning of the Heavenly Net Thunder Formation engulfed Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Accepting Heavenly Net Thunder Formation.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your lightning energy is being enhanced.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Bijang’s malicious Heavenly Net Thunder Formation, instead of harming Seong Jihan, actually strengthened him further.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, Ariel’s voice could be heard, [Master… This lightning energy opposes me. Summoning Eclipse in this state is unwise.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll have to summon you at the entrance next time. I see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Although there was a drawback of not being able to wield the power of shadows that oppose the lightning, considering everything, the lightning from the Heavenly Net Thunder Formation was substantial.
 </p>
 <p>
  It had, at a minimum, doubled his strength, optimizing the environment for using the Divine Thunder Decree.
 </p>
 <p>
  -Why did Seong Jihan suddenly turn into Pikachu? Using Thunderbolt?
 </p>
 <p>
  -His flashing is so intense, it hurts my eyes. LOL
 </p>
 <p>
  -Guys, what’s his gift?
 </p>
 <p>
  – If you’re curious, please subscribe to find out! Please ㅠㅠ
 </p>
 <p>
  – If you’re Korean, please get all your family and relatives to subscribe!!
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers are curious about the gift after seeing Seong Jihan, who became a Pikachu.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a slightly more somber face, Bijang looked at Seong Jihan.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Hmm… seeing you handle that amount of lightning energy, you’re not a spy from the Wind Empire.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Bijang starts to trust the player a bit more.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I wondered why he hated me so much. Was it not just because of how I looked but because he thought I was a spy?’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘In my last life, I was never suspected of being a spy…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan couldn’t help but be puzzled about why he had such suspicions.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The first wave of invasion begins.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Saaaa…
 </p>
 <p>
  As the other side of the bridge was quickly engulfed in darkness, any doubts were set aside for now.
 </p>
 <p>
  For now, he had to fend off the immediate enemy.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ve almost used up this relic.’
 </p>
 <p>
  An A-grade Otherworldly Relic was purchased to increase stats.
 </p>
 <p>
  The relic was a higher grade than the C-grade horse sword that absorbed divine power before, but its absorption efficiency was worse than before.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was because Seong Jihan’s stats had increased significantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You completely understand the Ortherwoldly Religion.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Absorbing all the power contained in the Otherworldly Relic.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Divine power slightly rises.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Item grade changes to F.]
 </p>
 <p>
  In the end, the A-grade relic only increased the Divine power by 1 point and was downgraded to F-grade.
 </p>
 <p>
  The average price of an A-grade relic is around 2.5 billion won.
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering that he needs to raise Divine power by 3 to increase 1 Force, he’d need to spend at least 7.5 billion won for just 1 point.
 </p>
 <p>
  7.5 billion won.
 </p>
 <p>
  It might seem like an astronomical amount for ordinary people.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s so cheap.’
 </p>
 <p>
  But from Seong Jihan’s perspective, it was an incredibly cheap deal.
 </p>
 <p>
  He wanted to spend all he earned on buying relics!
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But once I absorb a certain amount of divine power, I’ll be told to buy higher-grade relics…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The BattleNet system probably won’t let him keep exploiting this loophole.
 </p>
 <p>
  There’ll likely be another limit, as before.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, Seong Jihan bought three relics at a time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of the three relics he bought this time, two allowed ‘understanding’ just by holding them all day, enabling him to absorb Divine power.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the remaining one didn’t.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Inventory.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan took out the A-grade Otherworldly Relic again.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Otherworldly Relic – Shinjo’s Toe Bone (A-grade)]
 </p>
 <p>
  [On planets that worship Shinjo as the God, fragments of the bird’s bones are considered valuable relics.
 </p>
 <p>
  The toe bone is the least valuable among them.]
 </p>
 <p>
  While the item description seemed simple, the bone Seong Jihan held was nearly as big as an average adult.
 </p>
 <p>
  If this was the size of a toe, it was hard to imagine how large the actual Shinjo was.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘How can I use this bone?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to use it as a weapon.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the toe bone was large, it was elongated enough to be used like a staff.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If it doesn’t work after one or two tries, I’ll have to buy something else.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile,
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s that toy-like… hmm?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bijang glanced at the blue bone Seong Jihan was holding, raising an eyebrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  He seemed about to say something, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, it doesn’t matter.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He shrugged it off, folding his arms.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, at the forefront of the Lone Bridge, a troop clad in black armor marched in formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thump! Thump!
 </p>
 <p>
  With every step, the ground resonated.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was an elite army with impeccable coordination.
 </p>
 <p>
  From beneath their helmets, the faces that stared out were nothing but skeletal, devoid of flesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the Death Knight troop, the first-wave monster.
 </p>
 <p>
  Along with them, from the cliffs beside the bridge, semi-transparent grayish ghosts flew.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  The first wave invasion troops, the Undead Legion.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the Death Knights stormed the bridge, ghost troops flew and attacked from the cliffs.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Watch my back. Soldier.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Gatekeeper glanced at the ghosts flying by his side and was about to charge towards the Death Knight squad.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan stepped forward and stopped the Gatekeeper.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You. What are you doing?”
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

 </div>
 <p>
  “Gatekeeper, please intercept the enemies in the air. I will take responsibility for the front.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You little… Have you gone mad?”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s words, the Gatekeeper’s face turned crimson.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Gatekeeper is wary of the player.]
 </p>
 <p>
  All the points earned after passing numerous tests seemed wasted in a flash.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Seong Jihan had a reason for doing this.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘At the Gold Rank, we can’t even withstand the first wave.’
 </p>
 <p>
  While the Death Knight squad was inherently stronger than the ghost squad, the soldiers guarding the cliff’s edge were so low-level that they couldn’t fend off the ghost squad.
 </p>
 <p>
  To defend against this, the power of the players was essential, but Gold Rank players were almost equivalent to regular soldiers, so they weren’t much help.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If the cliff is breached, the Gatekeeper will destroy the bridge and self-destruct.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If he can’t even stop the first wave, how can he complete the Epic Quest?
 </p>
 <p>
  It was more efficient for the Gatekeeper to intercept the airborne enemies while he himself blocked those on the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  The only question was whether Seong Jihan could fend off the Death Knight squad alone.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That’s easy.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was confident.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can’t you step aside right now? How can a mere soldier stop the Death Knights!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Gatekeeper yelled,
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead of replying, Seong Jihan responded with action.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nameless Divine Skill, Divine Thunder Decree – Striking Thunderbolt
 </p>
 <p>
  The blue staff was imbued with the power of lightning at the tip of its toes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hoo~
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, taking a deep breath, shot the blue staff towards the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  Roar!
 </p>
 <p>
  The energy of the Striking Thunderbolt from the blue staff, combined with the intensified thunder due to lightning energy, and soon a massive lightning bolt struck right in the center of the Death Knight squad.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang! Bang! Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  The center of the Death Knight squad began to split apart under the destructive power of Striking Thunderbolt.
 </p>
 <p>
  The lightning energy, ideal for breaking demons, was fully unleashed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Striking Thunderbolt annihilated half of the Death Knight squad, leaving not even a speck of bone dust.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hiss!
 </p>
 <p>
  Smoke rose from the blue staff stuck in the center of the Death Knight squad.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan with Thunder Body took steps towards the blue staff.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Flashing Sky Thunder Steps.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  In what seemed like an instant teleportation, Seong Jihan was right at the center of the Death Knight squad, where the blue staff was.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite half of the Death Knight squad still remaining,
 </p>
 <p>
  With an utterly unfazed expression, Seong Jihan picked up the blue staff.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Gatekeeper, is this proof enough for you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh. Uhm! Who the hell are you…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m not good at aerial combat. So…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Even before Seong Jihan could finish speaking, Death Knights, wielding their swords, charged from all directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Their strikes, proving their potency as formidable undead monsters, came down without any gap, threateningly.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Seong Jihan’s prowess was most effective in close combat.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Death Knights’ sword strikes, though they never even reached the absolute domain, seemed endlessly slow and posed no real threat.
 </p>
 <p>
  Towards the heads of such Death Knights, the blue staff, entwined with lightning, swung mercilessly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Paaak!
 </p>
 <p>
  In a single blow, the entire body of the Death Knight could not withstand the powerful lightning energy and disintegrated into a handful of bone dust.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang!
 </p>
 <p>
  The armor, now masterless, lost its strength and crumpled to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  The fearless Death Knights, oblivious to the remains of their comrade, charged continuously without end.
 </p>
 <p>
  From a distance, it was hard to spot Seong Jihan among the swarm of Death Knights surrounding him.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, as a bolt of lightning swiftly streaked through the sky, the encirclement was effortlessly shattered.
 </p>
 <p>
  The power of the lightning was a perfect counter to the undead.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bone dust flew around like desert sand, and piles of black armor accumulated on the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll handle the ground. What do you think?” Seong Jihan, standing atop a heap of armor, inquired.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bijang blinked his large eyes and scowled.
 </p>
 <p>
  Until moments ago, his expression had been one of sheer disapproval toward Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  But now, his lips curled up into a smirk.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hah! You’re somewhat useful after all!”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a swift motion, Bijang reached out to the sky, and dozens of lightning bolts mercilessly struck down.
 </p>
 <p>
  Their target was the Ghost Army crossing the cliff.
 </p>
 <p>
  In an instant, over half of the ghost legion disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Demonstrating the power befitting an Imperial Gatekeeper, Bijang chuckled, crossing his arms once more.
 </p>
 <p>
  His gaze returned to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Fine. Go ahead and have your fun.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Bijang trusts the player a bit more.]
 </p>

  Chapter 80

 <p>
  Chapter 80
 </p>
 <p>
  `- Isn’t that just a skeleton, not a Death Knight?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Yeah, no way it’s a Death Knight lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  – You need to be at least level 80 as a warrior to barely manage against such a mob…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Damn, isn’t that Seong Jihan is crazy powerful?
 </p>
 <p>
  Anyone who watches Seong Jihan’s channel knows he’s powerful.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since his first stream, the performances he has showcased always seemed to mock conventional wisdom.
 </p>
 <p>
  If there’s a reason the viewers are continually amazed, it’s because the scale of his ‘conventional wisdom-defying performance’ was unpredictable.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just like now.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the defense game “Lone Bridge”, a map used from Gold to Diamond Ranks.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not only has Silver Rank Seong Jihan joined the fray, but he’s also vastly outperforming the other players in the scene.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially the way he stands alone against hordes of Death Knights, carving through them.
 </p>
 <p>
  The performance Seong Jihan is currently showing would be a feat even for a Platinum player.
 </p>
 <p>
  After his top 100 promotion match, Seong Jihan’s fandom began to buzz.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Jihan is so cool! Why can’t he just be selected as the national representative right now?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Right? He seems to be performing way better than the current national team.
 </p>
 <p>
  – The League will end up last again if this goes on, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Well, it’s already last lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Geez; ever since the Sword King appeared, this deluded Fan Club has emerged; please, know your place.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though the idea of him being a national representative seemed far-fetched and the Fan Club’s comments were met with backlash from other viewers.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, there was no denying Seong Jihan’s prowess was unparalleled.
 </p>
 <p>
  As viewers debated, Seong Jihan, who had annihilated the Death Knight squad, waited for the next wave.
 </p>
 <p>
  The thud of hooves heralded the approach of a Death Knight cavalry unit, all riding skeletal horses.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike the previous Death Knights, these wore white armor with a black bird engraved on their chests.
 </p>
 <p>
  They charged with massive lances.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sight of hundreds of cavalry units charging with their lances.
 </p>
 <p>
  – LANCE CHARGE!!! Dodge it!!! Move to the side!!!!!
 </p>
 <p>
  – It’s over!!!!!!!
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers thought this might be the real danger for Seong Jihan, but then, lightning crackled as Seong Jihan leaped towards the cavalry with his blue staff enveloped in lightning.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll maximize my Force in this chance.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Almost as if they had planned it, sharp lance tips raced towards Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  The simultaneous attacks, precisely spaced, reminded one of an iron maiden torture device.
 </p>
 <p>
  A perfect encirclement. A seemingly inescapable crisis.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, Seong Jihan welcomed this situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Using the Force, I’ll create an opening.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Some attacks came faster than the enemies intended; others slower.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the midst of these converging attacks, a time lag occurred.
 </p>
 <p>
  Their lances tangled, creating gaps where there were none.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Just like this.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan lightly stepped on the tangled lances as if they were stairs, closing the distance between him and his enemies.
 </p>
 <p>
  By the time the Death Knights tried to draw their swords as their lances were rendered useless by the close proximity, Seong Jihan’s blue staff was quicker.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a thud, a Death Knight’s head flew off, and Seong Jihan began tearing through the cavalry.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Death Knights tried to resist, but to no avail.
 </p>
 <p>
  Their bad luck wasn’t over.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The relic ‘Shinjo’s Toe Bone’ detects a corrupted species of Shinjo.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The bone begins to burn true to its original purpose.]
 </p>
 <p>
  At some point, the blue staff Seong Jihan held ignited with a brilliant white flame, incinerating the Death Knights effortlessly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That black bird symbol on the armor… was there a connection?’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This isn’t helping my training.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Though Seong Jihan momentarily harbored a complaint seeing the toe bone act up,
 </p>
 <p>
  [You completely understand the Ortherwoldly Religion.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Divine power increases by 1. Integrated into Force.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Grade of the ‘Otherworldly Relic – Shinjo’s Toe Bone decreases to B-grade.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The ‘Otherworldly Relic – Shinjo’s Toe Bone has fulfilled its destiny.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Divine power increases by 3. Integrated into Force.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Grade of the ‘Otherworldly Relic – Shinjo’s Toe Bone decreases to E-grade.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The relic fails to overcome the power of faith and disappears.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Divine power… 4?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Other A-rank relics only increased it by 1 each.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once he learned its true use, the toe bone increased the Divine power by 4 and had fulfilled its purpose.
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, the force stat he wanted to increase naturally increased as well.

 <p>
  [Force increases by 2.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Force and Martial Power stats are shared. Martial Power increases by 2.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Both Force and Martial Power increased.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Ah, no need for practice.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The dissatisfaction he felt moments ago vanished.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked affectionately at the toe bone, which turned to dust and disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Farewell… dear Toe Bone…’
 </p>
 <p>
  [From now on, you can only absorb Divine Power from relics of SS rank or higher.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the system put restrictions on continuously benefiting, Seong Jihan decided to enjoy the moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Inventory.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Replacing the vanished toe bone, Seong Jihan took out Phoenix’s Arrow and continued to suppress the enemies.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan smashed the head of the last remaining Death Knight.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Normal Quest, ‘1st Bridge Conquest’ Cleared.]

 </p>
 <p>
  [Hidden Quest, ‘One-Man Army’ Cleared.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have earned 10,000 achievement points.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It was a good thing that the map changed.’
 </p>
 <p>
  There were no more achievements to earn in the Valley of the End map.
 </p>
 <p>
  By just dealing with the likes of Death Knights in this new map, they gave away so many achievement points.
 </p>
 <p>
  A satisfied smile crept on Seong Jihan’s face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you have fun?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  Thump! Thump!
 </p>
 <p>
  Bijang, who just a while ago was belittling Seong Jihan, now approached with a relaxed expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thundercloud keeps nudging me to recommend you as the Imperial Gatekeeper. It seems he wants to serve you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Bijang said that,
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzt!
 </p>
 <p>
  As if responding, lightning flashed from the seven spears that made up Thundercloud Spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But that cannot happen.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bijang pointed beyond the bridge.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the Death Knight squad had been annihilated,
 </p>
 <p>
  On the other side of the massive bridge, flags bearing the emblem of a black bird with its wings spread fluttered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soldiers in black armor were lined up tightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The best of Wind Empire, Phoenix Corps has arrived… The position of the Imperial Gatekeeper will soon be over.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Undead Legion was just a vanguard.
 </p>
 <p>
  The real main force of the enemy, incomparable to the Undead Legion, was the elite of elites.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Black Cavalry, Phoenix Corps.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this bridge map, the toughest 2nd wave was about to begin.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud! Thud1
 </p>
 <p>
  Between the enemy cavalrymen, a giant, much larger than the mounted soldiers, walked forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not only was he large in stature, but his twisted face also resembled Bijang’s.
 </p>
 <p>
  As expected, the giant opened his mouth toward Bijang.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Big Brother Bijang.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hojo…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Phoenix Corps’ leader, Hojo.
 </p>
 <p>
  He glanced at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…You’ve got a good disciple.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This guy isn’t my disciple. How could I have someone who looks like this as my disciple?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That may be so. His face looks rather weak. Someone with a face like that cannot become a true warrior.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s regrettable.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The sincere conversation between the two giants left the viewers in disbelief.
 </p>
 <p>
  – They, with ruined faces, are judging appearances HAHA!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Right, it’s not the face of a true warrior. Seong Jihan should join them.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Are they crazy?
 </p>
 <p>
  – If his face turned like that, I wouldn’t watch;;
 </p>
 <p>
  That playful banter was short-lived.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  Hojo drew a massive sword from his back.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Big Brother Bijang. As a fellow giant, let me advise you for the last time. Are you considering becoming a naturalized citizen of the Wind Empire?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can’t. The Emperor of the Cloud Empire is like my sworn brother. I can’t betray the loyalty between us.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What kind of brother leaves his younger sibling so alone like this? Big Brother Bijang, you’ve been used.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No…! That’s not true… My sworn brother will come to guard the bridge.”
 </p>

 <p>
  Bijang’s voice, as he said this, lacked strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed he didn’t genuinely believe that reinforcements would come.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hahaha! Big Brother Bijang! Do you truly not understand why the Emperor of the Cloud Empire asked you to guard the bridge with such a ragtag group?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Hojo pointed to the other side of the bridge with the tip of his sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  The 50 players summoned to this game and the soldiers supporting them.
 </p>
 <p>
  He judged them to be a mismatched bunch.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Look at this!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The wind gathered at the tip of his sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  When the giant swung his blade, a gust swept through.
 </p>
 <p>
  This wind was not just any wind.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a fierce wind-blade, cutting through everything it touched.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan suppressed the wind with the power of his force, easily deflecting it. However,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aaah…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  From the backside of the bridge, screams of various kinds echoed.
 </p>
 <p>
  From such a distance, he slaughtered the enemies across the bridge with his wind-blade.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He’s strong.’
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan was admiring Hojo’s blade, he suddenly furrowed his brow.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed there were too many screams from behind.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It can’t be… the game isn’t over, is it?’
 </p>
 <p>
  In this defense game, when half of the survivors remain, the game ends.
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, that basic rule came to his mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nah, it can’t be.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just because they couldn’t block that casual wind-blade, the game can’t be over, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially when Gold Ranks are here?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan tried to think positively, but then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Only 15 survivors remain.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The game is ending.]
 </p>
 <p>
  His ominous hunch became a reality.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hahaha. Isn’t it pitiful? Not even half remained!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Hojo smirked, pointing across the bridge with his blade.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your sworn brother has no intention of helping you. In fact, he probably wishes for your death here!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hojo! Don’t insult my brother!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you really think you can guard this bridge with that ragtag group? You should know the meaning behind such an order…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You bastard!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Thundercloud Spear retracted, and as the Thundercloud returned to Bijang’s hand, Seong Jihan stiffened at the sight.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is…
 </p>
 <p>
  An event that happens when a bridge map game ends.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Big Brother Bijang! Why not join the Wind Empire? The Emperor will value you highly. Look at me, a giant, he even made me the leader of the Phoenix Corps!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can’t. I can’t betray my brother’s trust.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It was… he who betrayed first!”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Hojo’s words, Bijang bit his lips hard and didn’t respond.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead, he gripped Seong Jihan’s shoulder.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You… will live.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a swift move, unlike the initial rebound from the bridge, this time he couldn’t resist.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was flung far behind the bridge, Hojo’s blade aimed at the flying Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “A sprouting problem should be nipped in the bud…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not on my watch!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Hojo’s blade, aiming to cut down Seong Jihan, was blocked by Bijang’s spear, the two began to clash fiercely.
 </p>
 <p>
  A moment later, Bijang thrust his Thundercloud Spear into the bridge.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
 </p>
 <p>
  “…True. Alone, I can’t stop it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If that’s the case…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If I can’t stop it, I’ll destroy it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With those words, the massive bridge began to crumble.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh. Breaking the bridge…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Hojo, who had clashed with Bijang, stepped back with a click of his tongue.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Bijang fell along with the collapsing bridge into the abyss below, the ‘Lone Bridge’ game ended.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a ‘suicide’ event that occurs if the player’s survival rate drops below 50% before 2nd Wave starts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, hovering in the air, recalled the epic quest he had just received.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Epic Quest]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Earn the recognition of the Imperial Gatekeeper and prevent his death.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This… It’s not something I can achieve just by doing well alone…’
 </p>

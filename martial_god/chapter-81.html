 <p>
  Chapter 81
 </p>
 <p>
  – What? It ends here?
 </p>
 <p>
  – How does a game end this quickly? I wanted to see more of Jihan ㅠㅠ.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some viewers complained while looking at the bland ending of ‘Lone Bridge’.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Gold Rank did well just to last until here.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Right, getting annihilated by flying ghost troops and Bijang breaking the bridge is the usual. How is Gold Rank going to stop the 1st wave? It’s basically a survival game to see who survives against the ghost troops.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because the map was used from Gold League to all the way up to Diamond League, it was quite difficult for those at Gold rank.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the Gold Rank, the main objective isn’t to stop the enemy but to survive within the top 50%.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some even argued that this map should be included in the survival category.
 </p>
 <p>
  – But what Jihan did was quite innovative. He stopped the 1st wave like that?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Right, but that’s a strategy only Jihan can use. Others would get taken out in one minute. Who else can block the Death Knight squad in place of Bijang? Not a single person in Gold can.
 </p>
 <p>
  – But… that… Silver… pulled it off… ㅋ_ㅋ
 </p>
 <p>
  While telling Bijang to intercept the aerial enemies, Jihan completely changed the course of the game.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels
 </p>
 <p>
  Had the Gold in the rear not died so disappointingly, a new aspect of ‘Lone Bridge’ might have emerged.
 </p>
 <p>
  – These players are really no help ㅋㅋㅋㅋ. Getting blown away by wind pressure, is that for real?
 </p>
 <p>
  – From now on, Jihan should match with Platinum…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Isn’t the power level too unrealistic? He’s way too strong!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Even Platinum would struggle fighting the Death Knight squad alone. Probably needs to be at least Level 150?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Let’s look at the status window!! Hurry up and press the subscribe button!!!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Yes~ everyone please subscribe~~ Time to promote~~~
 </p>
 <p>
  Before they knew it, Jihan’s subscriber count had surpassed 700,000.
 </p>
 <p>
  The growth was incredible, but to the viewers wanting to see the status window, it felt agonizingly slow.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the other hand, Jihan was disappointed in Gold.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is Gold’s level only this much?’
 </p>
 <p>
  He hadn’t expected much, but not being able to block even the wind attack from afar was too much.
 </p>
 <p>
  If things continued this way, even if he did well in the 1st wave, he would be wiped out in the event before the 2nd wave started.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Being by the cliff would make it hard to get Bijang’s recognition.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if he summoned Ariel to protect the players, it wouldn’t be possible to cover that wide range.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘As expected of an Epic Quest, it doesn’t let you complete it easily.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Jihan thought so, looking at the system message.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have recorded 1st place in the Defense game.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [For participating in the higher league, your experience and GP gain rate increase by 50%.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [1st place reward, experience and GP gain rate increase by 50%.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your level has increased by 3.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have gained 50,000 GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ve leveled up by 3 levels…?’
 </p>
 <p>
  3 levels up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even at Silver, it wasn’t easy to level up by one just by winning a game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Being Silver but ranking 1st in a game with Golds, the rewards were massive.
 </p>
 <p>
  At this point, it felt like the system was urging him to quickly move up to Gold.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  The following message seemed to reinforce that notion.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have achieved the Hidden Quest, ‘League Transcendence’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have received 30,000 achievement points as a reward.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have cleared the Hidden Quest, ‘Achieve 1st place in the higher league’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have received 50,000 achievement points as a reward.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The achievement point rewards were even more astounding, gaining more points than what he’d get from completing an epic quest.
 </p>
 <p>
  “With this, the achievement points I’ve obtained now are…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan invested all the 3 additional points he earned into Martial Power and checked his status window.
 </p>
 <p>

 <p>
  Class – Warrior
 </p>
 <p>
  Gift – Shadow of the Sun (Rank SS)
 </p>
 <p>
  Title – King Among Kings – Bronze
 </p>
 <p>
  Ruler of the Bronze League
 </p>
 <p>
  Achievement Points – 185,300
 </p>
 <p>
  The status window had noticeably grown compared to before.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked over his attributes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The growth rate increase buff is definitely useful.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He hadn’t been running his guild for a long time, but in his spare time, he was always engrossed in training.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a result, his Martial Power and Force increased by 1, and Sahdow Sword increased by 2.
 </p>
 <p>
  With these abilities, he was unmatched not just in silver, but also in gold leagues.
 </p>
 <p>
  “At this rate, I might be able to compete even in platinum.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering the combined effects of Martial Power and Force, he felt confident that he could suppress those starting at level 100 in the Platinum League.
 </p>
 <p>
  A battle against those starting at level 200 in the Diamond League might still be tough, but it wouldn’t be a walkover for them.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I continue to grow like this, I could become a national representative before reaching the Diamond League.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought about this while considering where to spend his achievement points.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The cost for adding a class was 250,000.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Excluding Archer, he had already acquired every class. If he purchased an additional class and obtained the Archer profession, he would have all classes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There must be something more.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Without concrete evidence, Seong Jihan had a strange conviction.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he got all classes, he didn’t think the status window would just list 4 classes like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even in the past, when he had spent all his achievement points, he hadn’t considered adding a class because he felt it was too extravagant to spend 250,000 on a mere hunch.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I earn achievement points faster than I thought.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He already had 185,000. With this, he felt it was worth trying to gather another 70,000 and challenge the class addition.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright. My next goal is to add a class.”
 </p>
 <p>
  To do so, he would have to complete a significant achievement quest.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can’t just break through the epic quest alone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how hard he tried alone, it was meaningless.
 </p>
 <p>
  His teammates were being swept away easily.
 </p>
 <p>
  Therefore, there was something else he needed to tackle right now.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The linked quest of the Invasion map.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The quest to capture Viscount Naseed.
 </p>
 <p>
  When he first received that quest, he was too overwhelmed to attempt it, but now things were different.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I need to find out the strategy.”
 </p>

 <p>
  Joo Eunji, dressed in tracksuits, was drinking beer in front of her computer, watching a video on Seong Jihan’s channel.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow… He’s really insane.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She was munching on squid legs when she saw Seong Jihan facing off against the Death Knight squad and was left with her mouth wide open.
 </p>
 <p>
  The squid she was chewing fell onto the keyboard.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Take it away, Takeda.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, Goddess!”
 </p>
 <p>
  She casually threw it behind her chair and continued watching the awe-inspiring show of Seong Jihan’s prowess.
 </p>
 <p>
  “He’s definitely stronger now than when the Sword King was at Silver rank.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right, Goddess. It’s the first time in BattleNet history that a Silver Rank is playing with the Gold Rank.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “True…”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Did I need to come in person?’ Joo Eunji briefly pondered.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No. Securing the Sword King is the priority.’
 </p>
 <p>
  She thought of the Sword King, whom she hadn’t yet fully grasped, and shook her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  The reason Japan continuously ranked first was solely due to the Sword King.
 </p>
 <p>
  As important as the future prospects were, a player who could produce immediate results was even more essential.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to find a way to connect with him somehow…’
 </p>
 <p>
  If she could only come into contact with Seong Jihan once, she was confident she could entice him.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, since the unprecedented message appeared, the situation had not been favorable.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It feels like I need to increase contact with him somehow.’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He doesn’t come down from the penthouse… What a pain.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed Seong Jihan lived almost exclusively in his penthouse, only occasionally coming down for guild-related reports.
 </p>

 <p>
  Rumors had it that he trained there obsessively.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s why Joo Eunji, contrary to her initial plan, had been editing constantly since joining the guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not easy to get into the penthouse.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Joo Eunji sipped her beer and made the comment.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kneeling behind her, Takeda cautiously raised his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How about getting close to Yoon Seah? Become close friends and get invited to the penthouse…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can’t exert my powers on Seong Jihan, so I can’t waste them on other players either. My avatar’s power isn’t that abundant.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pondering Joo Eunji’s words, Takeda suddenly clapped his hands in realization.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah! I’ve thought of a good way!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Joo Eunji asked with a sullen face, Takeda passionately began to explain.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You just need to get to the penthouse, right? Then…!”
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  Guild office.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…You want to film the training sessions of the Owner and Seah?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes! Not just them, but if there are others training, it would be great to film and upload it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Guild Master Lee Hayeon considered Joo Eunji’s proposal.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That’s a good idea.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed, since Seong Jihan’s last advertisement shoot, the guild channel had been devoid of any special content.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘She’s already swamped with video editing, but she’s suggesting more work for herself…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon looked at Joo Eunji with warm eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike other editors who preferred working from home, Joo Eunji kept regular hours and produced high-quality content.
 </p>
 <p>
  And on top of that, she was suggesting ideas that would increase her workload for the sake of the guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I have to keep such an employee.’
 </p>
 <p>
  How many employees treat the company’s business as their own?
 </p>
 <p>
  Joo Eunji looked particularly appealing to Lee Hayeon at that moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you for the great idea. I’ll ask about it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Joo Eunji bowed 90 degrees and left the Guild Master’s office.
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching her leave, Lee Hayeon, with a satisfied expression, immediately contacted Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Film the training process?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. I was thinking it might be good to show it as guild content. If there’s any sensitive part, we can omit that.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s nothing particularly sensitive.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked to the side while on the call.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the penthouse’s training room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah was doing squats with a barbell fully loaded with weight plates.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hu~ Hoo~”
 </p>
 <p>
  She was catching her breath.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her face, flushed red and drenched in sweat, Yoon Seah strained with every movement.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Grr… Grrr!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As she continued her sets, Seah’s face contorted more and more with the effort.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan shook his head slightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “However, Seah’s face gets really distorted during training… That’s a bit of a concern.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, uncle! What do you mean my face gets distorted! I want to do it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Having put the barbell back on the squat rack, Yoon Seah hurriedly approached to protest.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You just don’t see it because you close your eyes. It was a sight by the end.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow~ Uncle, that’s too much! I’m going to do it, definitely!”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Why is she so enthusiastic?’
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan looked at her in bewilderment, Yoon Seah grinned.
 </p>
 <p>
  “People keep asking how my stats increase so quickly… and they keep leaving hateful comments saying I only got better due to gifts. I wanted to show them the training.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…They leave hate comments over that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Such idle people…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon, Seong Jihan nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright. Let’s film it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Once they see the intensity of her training, those hate comments will likely stop.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you hear that, Hayeon? We’ll do it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. When would be a good time?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t mind anytime. You can come right up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Got it. We’ll prepare immediately~!]
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, Seong Jihan accepted Lee Hayeon’s proposal.
 </p>

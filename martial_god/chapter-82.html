 <p>
  Chapter 82
 </p>
 <p>
  In the guild’s broadcasting channel,
 </p>
 <p>
  After Seong Jihan’s advertisement making video was uploaded, no notable videos were posted for a while.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, a new video appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Sudden coverage at the penthouse! What kind of training do guild members do?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hello, everyone~!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon, holding a microphone, waved at the camera held by Joo Eunji.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike other guild masters who seemed reserved, Lee Hayeon actively promoted herself whenever there was an opportunity to be on air.
 </p>
 <p>
  And, of course, the reason for that was…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Oh! I missed seeing Hayeon~~!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Please broadcast more often ㅠㅠ
 </p>
 <p>
  – Her beauty is killing it today ㄷㄷㄷ!
 </p>
 <p>
  She did it to elicit passionate responses from the viewers who were subscribed to the guild channel.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, you’re all giving me too much attention~ Hehe!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon said with a hand gesture, but her playful wink made her look sly like a fox.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm, she’s quite something.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Joo Eunji thought, holding the camera.
 </p>
 <p>
  Every move of Hayeon was more than enough to melt men’s hearts.
 </p>
 <p>
  – I’m dying from Hayeon’s beauty!! ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
 </p>
 <p>
  – Why visit the penthouse? Just do a cam show with the guild master ㅠㅠ
 </p>
 <p>
  – We see Seong Jihan every day on his channel, but it’s hard to see you ㅠㅠㅠ
 </p>
 <p>
  -Stop sucking up! You’ll give the guild master the wrong idea!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Remember Seong Jihan is the main character!
 </p>
 <p>
  While watching the chaotic chatroom, Lee Hayeon thought,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s about time.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Once she confirmed enough people were watching, she moved towards the elevator.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now, everyone, shall we head to Sword Palace’s penthouse?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Beep! Beep! Beep!
 </p>
 <p>
  When she pressed the call button of Sword Palace’s private elevator, Seong Jihan’s voice flowed from the speaker next to it.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Who is it?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Owner, it’s Hayeon~!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ah, yes, come up.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the elevator door opened, Lee Hayeon gazed at the sparkling private elevator leading to the penthouse.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s my first time visiting Sword Palace’s penthouse.”
 </p>
 <p>
  – Oh come on Hayeon, you’re from a chaebol family, don’t you live in a place like that?
 </p>
 <p>
  – For real, she’s from the Lee family.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, if we’re talking about the old house I used to live in, maybe… but the place I live now might be smaller than the guild office. I live on my own now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  – Oh.
 </p>
 <p>
  – The guild office… it looked pretty big…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, not exactly like that, but I live with my bodyguard, Gayeong, so we need a certain amount of space.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Lee Hayeon pointed to Lim Gayeong behind the camera, Gayeong quickly made a “shush” gesture.
 </p>
 <p>
  Being in a protective role, revealing too much information was uncomfortable for her.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m
 </p>
 <p>
  “I guess our bodyguard doesn’t want to talk about it anymore, everyone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  – That short-haired woman? Why isn’t she on the broadcast!!!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Show her!!! Show her!!!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Aren’t bodyguards supposed to… stay by your side…to protect…?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, right. Gayeong, want to join?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon gestured to Lim Gayeong after seeing the viewers’ reactions, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m good.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lim Gayeong, perhaps not fond of the attention, refused decisively.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, when Lee Hayeon moved slightly to the side, Gayeong’s reflection could be seen in the mirror of the open elevator.
 </p>
 <p>
  “My lady……”
 </p>
 <p>
  – LOL, the guild master has a great sense of humor.
 </p>
 <p>
  – The bodyguard looks surprisingly cute~~ㅎㅎ
 </p>
 <p>
  – Hasn’t she always been cute?
 </p>
 <p>
  Lim Gayeong sighed deeply.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Because of you, my lady, I feel like I’ve sold my face to everyone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “As a player, it’s a profession where you get attention from people. The more exposure, the better.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s true when you put it that way… but why always…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What? Why what?”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Never mind. It’s not appropriate to discuss on air.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, if you say that and end it, what becomes of me!”
 </p>
 <p>
  During the elevator ride, Lee Hayeon and Lim Gayeong were chatting casually.
 </p>
 <p>
  But that was only for a moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as they reached the top floor, Lee Hayeon stopped the conversation and started their original broadcasting purpose, the ‘training filming’.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You are here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan greeted them at the entrance of the penthouse.
 </p>
 <p>
  Joo Eunji’, who was holding the camera, lit up her eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll start with the mic setting~!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Joo Eunji, who had proposed the training filming, quickly approached Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  As she was about to familiarly attach a small wireless microphone to him,
 </p>
 <p>
  Bzzzt!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah. Static again… I’m sorry.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, it’s okay.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Static sparked again where they touched.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It seems like it was like this before too.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Is she prone to static?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan didn’t think much of it, receiving the setting from her. However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…It’s not working again.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Joo Eunji could only suppress her dismayed feelings.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Access Denied.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Attempting analysis for access.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The target system denies the analysis.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Access Denied.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Her second attempt at access was completely thwarted.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If the analysis doesn’t work at all, there’s no use in trying to contact multiple times…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Capturing Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  She had anticipated it wouldn’t be easy, but she hoped that increasing contact would reveal a way.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the system message she got on the second contact was even stricter than before.
 </p>
 <p>
  “All set now~”
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite her mixed feelings, Joo Eunji kept a cheerful face as she stepped away from Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you, Eunji.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “My pleasure, Guild Master.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Joo Eunji received a camera and a diary she brought with her from Lee Hayeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the diary, sparsely filled with appointments,
 </p>
 <p>
  She had prepared a secret tool for this penthouse visit.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a valuable item to just use for luring Seong Jihan, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If he’s the type to block access, I have to try everything.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Joo Eunji decided coldly, but with a smile.

 <p>
  At the heart of the penthouse.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon was amazed at the training facility, which was incomparable to most gyms.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow. The training room is huge. You could open a gym with this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s why I haven’t moved yet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But, Owner. Haven’t they stopped telling you to leave the penthouse since the BattleNet Administration Director changed? When I met the new director, he pleaded for you to stay…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The previous director, though it was in the form of a voluntary resignation, was essentially driven out.
 </p>
 <p>
  The new director who replaced him had a very conciliatory stance toward Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the previous one get fired like that, of course he had to be.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But I can’t stay here forever, especially after donating to Sword Palace. I’m thinking of looking for a house once Seah’s training shows results.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I see…”
 </p>
 <p>
  – Leaving this nice house, where will you go ㅠㅠ
 </p>
 <p>
  – Maybe New York City?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Stop talking about New York ㅡㅡ Jihan won’t go!
 </p>
 <p>
  – But it would be unsettling if he leaves Sword Palace…ㅜㅜ
 </p>
 <p>
  – Right after leaving, Gates might pop up. I’m nervous lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Really, every time a Gates message pops up in the sponsorship, my heart sinks lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers who felt PTSD from Robert Gates’ sponsorship messages.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because they indirectly experienced his financial bombing.
 </p>
 <p>
  They felt that Gates could easily provide Seong Jihan with a house even grander than the Sword Palace’s penthouse.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Owner, you won’t leave Korea, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have no such plans yet.”

 <p>
  “I caught the ‘yet’… Alright! Shall we start the training, which is our main purpose?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon changed the topic and entered deeper into the training room.
 </p>
 <p>
  There, drenched in sweat, Yoon Seah was sitting exhaustedly on a bench, wiping her head with a towel.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hah! Hah!… Have you arrived, sister?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, Seah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  – Oh… Sweat…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Whoa…
 </p>
 <p>
  – I really like the Atmosphere Guild… The trio is the best…
 </p>
 <p>
  – You’re not a minor anymore, right? It’s okay to look and admire without getting arrested, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  – That means I’ll not be arrested!
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, who was already famous for her beauty, was here.
 </p>
 <p>
  As her exhausted figure drenched in sweat was shown, a sight not usually seen, the viewers cheered at this unique sight. However…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle, can I get some healing?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright. Regeneration. Heal. Great Heal.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, I think I’ll live.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright, ready to strain those muscles again?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “ …Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your answer sounds weak.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, sir!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s three-part healing set was activated, and Yoon Seah went back to her workout.
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers started to sense that this wasn’t just some light exercise.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Seong Jihan is really playing the Support role. How many times is he using heal? Is he just trying to exhaust her?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Is that how her stamina stat increases so fast?
 </p>
 <p>
  Step by step.
 </p>
 <p>
  Walking towards the barbell placed on the ground like a cow being led to the slaughterhouse, Yoon Seah heard Seong Jihan’s sharp words.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll add a bit more weight.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Eek…”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s gesture, multiple weight plates floated in the air and then thudded onto the barbell.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, Yoon Seah gripped the barbell with both hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Heugh…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As she took a deep breath and began the deadlift, the muscles in her back bulged out prominently.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Whoa… This isn’t just ‘wow’, this is insane.”
 </p>
 <p>
  – My god!
 </p>
 <p>
  – How much weight is she lifting? Look at the thickness of those plates. Insane.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Eughhh…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  When Yoon Seah placed the barbell down, a tremendous sound echoed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s do a bit more.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes… I understand…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching Yoon Seah exerting herself to the utmost, even using the strength she’d have as a baby, Lee Hayeon’s mouth fell open in surprise.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t surprising that she was working out.
 </p>
 <p>
  While in the Divergent Guild, many players had been training their bodies just like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  But,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s rest for 5 minutes, and then I’ll apply the three-part heal again. Let’s do it again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes… Understood… Uh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  She had never seen someone push their body to such extreme limits.
 </p>
 <p>
  So that’s why her stamina and strength stats grew at such a rapid pace.
 </p>
 <p>
  Was it due to this kind of insane training?
 </p>
 <p>
  – This is really brutal…
 </p>
 <p>
  – This might hinder muscle growth, though. How can muscles grow if you just exhaust them like this?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Players have healing magic…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Not just stimulation, but ample rest and nutrition are essential for muscle growth. This is abuse!
 </p>
 <p>
  – But doing that makes the stats increase the most, lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the chat window was buzzing with debates about whether this was torture or not, Lim Gayeong, who had been watching Yoon Seah’s training, sparkled with curiosity.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Excuse me, Mr. Seong Jihan. Can I ask you a question?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, go ahead.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Regeneration. Heal. Great Heal. Is there a specific reason for this order?”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Ah, she doesn’t know the optimal combination yet.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The optimal healing magic combination for muscle growth.
 </p>
 <p>
  The one who found out about this sequence was the future saint, Sophia.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, revealing this piece of information a bit early should be fine.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia had discovered this combination to help Seong Jihan in her past life.
 </p>
 <p>
  Back then, she had freely shared the information she found with the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan began to speak.
 </p>

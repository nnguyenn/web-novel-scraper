  Chapter 83

  [Translator – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  Chapter 83
 </p>
 <p>
  “By using Regeneration, the recovery time needed for muscle growth is reduced, and by simultaneously using both Heal and Great Heal, muscle synthesis is promoted…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After hearing Seong Jihan’s explanation, Lim Gayeong nodded and asked him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But why do we have to use both Heal and Great Heal together?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you use only Heal, there are cases where it can hinder muscle growth. Great Heal counteracts such side effects. It seems to be related to Great Heal’s ability to recover neurological fatigue… but I’m not entirely sure why.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He had once heard a detailed explanation about this from Priestess Sophia in the past.
 </p>
 <p>
  But he hadn’t paid much attention as he wasn’t a Support.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan decided to just say, “From my experience, this has proven to be the most effective.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The detailed mechanism would likely be clarified by other researchers in the future.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If Great Heal is required, it’ll be difficult for low-level Supports to use.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then it would be better just to use Regeneration. Without Great Heal, fatigue doesn’t completely recover.”
 </p>
 <p>
  – Isn’t this kind of high-level information?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Right? Should we really be sharing this?
 </p>
 <p>
  – But it seems hard to actually use in practice. Supporters capable of using Great Heal probably won’t help with training.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Well, they’d probably make more money working part-time at a hospital LOL
 </p>
 <p>
  – If its efficacy is proven, things might change?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Yes, guilds have more money than hospitals, after all.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps because Seong Jihan was giving away such high-level information too casually, the viewers, who were listening, began to worry.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s okay. It’d be good if such training methods become widely known.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Having read the chat, Seong Jihan responded nonchalantly, causing Lim Gayeong to hesitantly ask,
 </p>
 <p>
  “If it’s not too much trouble… can I also experience it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sure.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon after, Lim Gayeong took off her suit jacket and stood next to Yoon Seah, who was at the squat rack.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite wearing a thin shirt, her well-toned muscles faintly showed through.
 </p>
 <p>
  She began to load the barbell with weight plates.
 </p>
 <p>
  – The two of them working out together looks like art.
 </p>
 <p>
  – But the weight she’s lifting is insane…
 </p>
 <p>
  – How much weight is she even lifting LOL
 </p>
 <p>
  – If I tried, I’d probably get crushed.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Look at Gayeong’s shoulders… they’re broader than mine…
 </p>
 <p>
  As Lim Gayeong started squatting,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I should do it too!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps motivated, Yoon Seah resumed her workout.
 </p>
 <p>
  The two, working out side by side, seemed to motivate each other.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sweating profusely, they intensely pushed their muscles to the limit.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can I take off my shirt?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh… go ahead.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Drenched in sweat, Lim Gayeong swiftly took off her white shirt, revealing her tank top, and continued to intensively work her muscles.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wow… so strong…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Look at both their ripped muscles…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Perhaps two of the top three beauties in the guild might need to “drop out”.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Drop out all of a sudden?
 </p>
 <p>
  – They’re too strong to be my bride.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Get out and drop dead.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Phew…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the two went about their fierce training regimen, Lee Hayeon, who had been watching them with wide eyes, turned her gaze to the camera.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Everyone, this suddenly turned into a fitness broadcast. We were supposed to see how the Owner trains, but…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Me? Should we film it now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh… Don’t you need to give them Heal?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I use healing magic after completely exhausting the muscles. I’ll cast it in an hour.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon looked at the two people working out after hearing that.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…I can’t be filming that muscle-tearing scene for an hour.’
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Shall we go and watch the owner’s training?”
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  In the room next to the training room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike the training room where gym equipment was placed, nothing was in this room.
 </p>

 <p>
  “It’s completely empty?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. I don’t need anything special when I train.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan raised his left hand and said,
 </p>
 <p>
  “My training method is simple. Ariel.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  From Seong Jihan’s arm, the dark elf Ariel appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  She looked at Seong Jihan with an indifferent expression and asked,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master. Are you going to do ‘that’ again?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. Attack me stronger this time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel, who had taken shape, disintegrated instantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead of her physical form, she turned into a shadowy energy, spreading out like mist.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Let’s hit at least once this time.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoooosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The black energy scattered like clouds, coming together to form little sword shapes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each individual sword wasn’t very powerful due to its small size, but there were so many of them.
 </p>
 <p>
  They surrounded Seong Jihan from every direction without a gap.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon was stunned by this unusual sight.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh… What kind of training is this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a method to control my psychokinesis. If Ariel’s sword touches me, I lose. If I deflect the sword using my psychokinesis, I win.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I see. It’s competitive. What’s your record so far?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve never lost, whether in BattleNet or training.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan said this calmly, the surrounding swords quivered.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This time will be different. Master. I’ll definitely hit you and win.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you two made a bet?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. If I level up next time, I bet whether to allocate all the points to Shadow Sword stat.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah…”
 </p>
 <p>
  – He’s betting with his leftover points to allocate stats.
 </p>
 <p>
  – LOL, so there’s really no loss, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Really, Shadow Sword stats seem like a cheat LOL.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the viewers said, there’s not much to lose, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon thought so but, of course, she didn’t say it out loud.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon, the training began.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whizz!
 </p>
 <p>
  The small black swords floating around, flew towards Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some fast.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some slow.
 </p>
 <p>
  The speed of the swords was irregular, making them unpredictable.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  [As expected… It doesn’t work?]Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  As they approached the area controlled by Seong Jihan, the movement of the swords began to change on their own.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sword aiming for Seong Jihan’s eyes turned its tip in the opposite direction.
 </p>
 <p>
  The swords that aimed for his face and chest changed direction and collided with other swords.
 </p>
 <p>
  The rain of swords that had been pressing down all at once began to clash against each other or fly in opposite directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan shrugged leisurely, a relaxed expression on his face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm. Is this all?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master… what an impressive control. Have you improved your control even more recently?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I think I should increase the number a bit next time. At this rate, I might never be able to do it properly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’d need Shadow Sword stat for that.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t have the luxury to invest in that just yet.”
 </p>

 </p>
 <p>
  Having successfully blocked the rain of swords, Seong Jihan and Ariel wrapped up their training and had a conversation.
 </p>
 <p>
  – ?
 </p>
 <p>
  – What? Is it over already?
 </p>
 <p>
  From the perspective of the viewers, it was a disappointingly quick conclusion.
 </p>
 <p>
  From the outside, the training had ended too quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The shrinking swords had disappeared after flying around and getting tangled with each other.
 </p>
 <p>
  – The female health enthusiasts seem to have a stronger impact.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Right? The niece is working out in the next room, but the uncle is just lounging around like a nobleman.

 <p>
  – Wow. Are you really comparing Jihan to someone just lazing around? You don’t even understand the depth of his training!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Yeah~ But you don’t either~
 </p>
 <p>
  – You youngsters…! Have you ever experienced a real sword fight?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Grandpa! Stop watching and rest. It’s bad for your eyes!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s die-hard fans and casual fans were arguing whether it was dull or not.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Oh. It’s already over…?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon, the reporter, also thought Seong Jihan’s training was not much of a big deal just like the viewers.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…This man. He’s on a different level.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Joo Eunji, holding the camera, had lost her bright smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ever since she arrived at the penthouse, even when she received the access denied message, she managed to force a bright smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  But now, her face was rigid.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘For a moment, he completely dominated this space.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike Lee Hayeon, who could barely be considered a player,
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though Joo Eunji’s current body was just an avatar and not her main self, she had the eyes to gauge someone’s abilities.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The power of the shadow controlling the sword was definitely… stronger than what Seong Jihan displayed.’
 </p>
 <p>
  To the outsiders, it seemed all too easy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if it was Ariel’s sword, it originated from Seong Jihan, didn’t it?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing him control it so effortlessly…
 </p>
 <p>
  – After all, the Shadow Sword is used by Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  – What’s so hard about controlling one’s own power? Lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  – It’s nothing special!
 </p>
 <p>
  That was the general opinion of the public.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The power within the shadow sword was, compared to the power with which Seong Jihan dominated the space… at least three times stronger.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Joo Eunji, the avatar of the ‘Goddess’, could clearly gauge Seong Jihan’s abilities.
 </p>
 <p>
  Their duel might have seemed to end uneventfully,
 </p>
 <p>
  But the exchange of power within was intricate.
 </p>
 <p>
  The pressing power of the Shadow Sword was far stronger than Jihan’s control of space,
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, with unbelievably precise control, he overcame this disadvantage.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘And he also… so naturally twisted the trajectory of the sword.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Using his Absolute Domain, he dominated a force far stronger than his own.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘We must… absolutely. Absolutely bring him to Japan. If he stays in Korea, it will undoubtedly become a major obstacle.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Joo Eunji bit her lip.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having wooed the Sword King, she believed that Japan would decisively trample Korea and take the top ranks in the league.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the more she saw Seong Jihan, the more her confidence waned.
 </p>
 <p>
  Right now, he may only be in the Silver Rank, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What about in a year?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Would he still be in silver by then?
 </p>
 <p>
  Would he have risen to the Diamond Rank, being selected as a national representative?
 </p>
 <p>
  Likely evolving into the most problematic player obstructing Japan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Can the “Sword King” easily suppress the Seong Jihan of a year later?
 </p>
 <p>
  Joo Eunji couldn’t be so confident about that.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I don’t know how such great players emerge from this small peninsula…’
 </p>
 <p>
  But to decisively subdue a rival nation in the same East Asian League, it was imperative to make Seong Jihan transfer allegiance to Japan.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the path for the country, and for everyone in her homeland.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Today’s training is over.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, Owner! Is it over already?”
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ugh, that was too dull… I was looking forward to Jihan’s training the most.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Seriously? You see that perfect control and still complain?
 </p>
 <p>
  – For real; some people never get satisfied.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Heh, they only see what they want to, huh…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Would you quit the old man chat? Geez!
 </p>
 <p>
  In the chat, viewers expressed dissatisfaction, calling Seong Jihan’s training session bland.
 </p>
 <p>
  But that was just the perspective of the general public.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having grasped the hidden essence behind that training, Joo Eunji made a special resolution.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘… Now is the time to use this.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Holding the camera in her right hand, she opened a diary with her left.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master.]
 </p>
 <p>
  In sword form, Ariel spoke so that only Seong Jihan could hear.
 </p>
 <p>
  [There is an Akashic Page over there.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Notes:
 </p>
 <p>
  TL/N – Ariel’s dialogues are sometimes formatted in “…“ and sometimes in […]. This is because when she’s in sword form, she uses something close to telepathy which is formatted […] but when she’s in humanoid form, she talks normally which is formatted “…”.]

 <p>
  Chapter 85
 </p>
 <p>
  At first, Joo Eunji was proud of what she thought was a success. But as time went by, she felt anxious.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Why isn’t he contacting me?’
 </p>
 <p>
  If someone falls under her Enchantment spell, they should naturally reach out first.
 </p>
 <p>
  So far, everyone under her Enchantment has done exactly that.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even with the Sword King, though the process of Enchantmenting him was tough, everything proceeded smoothly afterwards…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did my Enchantment weaken…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering there was no contact from the other party in the past two days, Joo Eunji could nearly confirm her suspicions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Particularly with the younger man who seemed restless without contacting her.
 </p>
 <p>
  In cases like Barren, whom she briefly enchanted from the Daegi Guild, he had managed to send her long English texts from the US. How did he even get her number?
 </p>
 <p>
  But no messages from Seong Jihan?
 </p>
 <p>
  This could only mean that the effect of the Enchantment had almost faded.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Sigh… This is tricky.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Joo Eunji bit her lip.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the Enchantment was entirely dispelled, then he’s a truly annoying opponent. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering the precious Akashic Page she had used, the only surefire way to lure Seong Jihan was with her main body.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But because of Sword King, I can’t bring my main body…’
 </p>
 <p>
  If Sword King had been under the status ailments ‘Submission’ and ‘Blind Devotion’, she could have left him for a few days.
 </p>
 <p>
  But due to the Twin Sword Gift he possesses, those ailments couldn’t be applied.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead, she used ‘Obsession’ and ‘Dependency,’ which meant she couldn’t leave Sword King casually.
 </p>
 <p>
  If she did, their relationship would deteriorate rapidly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But I could bring him just to Tokyo.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It would be okay to be apart from Sword King for a few hours.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This time, maybe I should go all out and use several at once.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Joo Eunji thought of Takeda.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had a useful support artifact in his possession.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he were to use the Akashic Page, it would have some effect on Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If he can resist the Enchantment himself, a drawn-out battle is no good. I need to settle this quickly.’
 </p>
 <p>
  True to her expertise in Enchantment, Joo Eunji analyzed the situation and texted Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Owner~ Are you free today by any chance?]
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, she was armed with three Akashic Pages.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Sigh. It cost me over 100 billion yen…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even for Ito Shizuru, who was secretly called a goddess in Japan’s political and financial circles and firmly positioned as a behind-the-scenes ruler, using four Akashic Pages was a significant expense.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan… You won’t be getting a salary.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ll have to make him work for his keep, even if it means feeding him just once a day.
 </p>
 <p>
  Joo Eunji gritted her teeth.

  In the penthouse of Sword Palace, the training room.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow, uncle, look at this!”
 </p>
 <p>
  After finishing her intense training, Yoon Seah laughed while watching her edited video on her smartphone.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The secret to +7 Stamina… An in-depth look at Yoon Seah’s stat increase!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Without investing any leftover points, just through training alone, Yoon Seah achieved a +7 in Stamina.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the most viewed video was Seong Jihan’s training video, Yoon Seah’s training became the biggest topic among the videos uploaded to the guild channel.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow… I look so ugly! Why didn’t you tell me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing her face scrunching up while doing deadlifts in the video, Yoon Seah laughed out loud.
 </p>

 <p>
  “I did tell you. Your face gets distorted when you exercise.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehe… I didn’t realize it was this bad. It’s so terrible.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Though she said she didn’t like it, Yoon Seah was actually enjoying the attention.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But the comments have become friendlier because of how bad I look.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Up until now, there were many negative comments about Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  But after showing her intense training and proving her achievements in such a short time, public opinion became much more favorable.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s why Yoon Seah wore a bright smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle, what class should I choose?”
 </p>
 <p>
  For a while, Yoon Seah, who had been looking at the video comments, asked Seong Jihan if she had seen a comment about her job.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you have something in mind?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was thinking of either Warrior or Archer…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why those two?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was interested in the Warrior because of Ito. As for the Archer, I trained variously at the academy… I realized I have a knack for accuracy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah chuckled, mimicking the pose of shooting an arrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But isn’t our national team for archers in Korea exceptionally strong? If you choose to be an Archer, it might be hard to compete against Ito, who naturalized in Japan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps it’s because Korea is renowned for its archery skills.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the Archer class players in Korea, only the top tier, or S-grade, had the ultimate talent.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the foundational skills were so exceptional that Korean Archers were known to be formidable.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then you should be a Warrior. The national team for Warriors is a bit more relaxed, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s true.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah sneakily glanced at Seong Jihan and muttered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But if I become a Warrior, I don’t think I can surpass uncle. I don’t think I can be the best.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan chuckled hearing that.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you choose Archer, the process to be selected for the national team will be hard. But being the best as a Warrior would also be challenging, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, because Uncle is like a monster in strength!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at Yoon Seah with a sense of pride.
 </p>
 <p>
  To outsiders, it might sound like she’s overly concerned about national team selection and becoming the best player despite being at a beginner’s level.
 </p>
 <p>
  But Seong Jihan thought, ‘With Seah’s potential, she has every right to say so.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In his past life, didn’t Xin Youhwa of China, who also had potential, quickly rise to the world ranking of 2nd place?
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah could surely do as much, if not more.
 </p>
 <p>
  In fact, she had awoken faster than Xin Youhwa, so she would have more time to grow.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether as a Warrior or an Archer, she can aim for the top.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan was proud of his niece’s clear ambition, he remarked,
 </p>
 <p>
  “That decision… is quite accurate.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He felt the need to state the obvious.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah, as long as I’m here, you won’t be the best Warrior. I’ll be the best Warrior in Korea, no, on Earth.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow… that’s unfortunate.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s the truth.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Family or not, it’s essential to be honest, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  Shrugging his shoulders, Seong Jihan advised Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you want to be the best in a class, I recommend Archer.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Because you’ll be the best Warrior?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, I won’t step down from the top.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He declared confidently that he would eventually be the world’s best Warrior.
 </p>
 <p>
  This wasn’t baseless arrogance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even without his powers in his past life, Seong Jihan was the top Warrior.
 </p>
 <p>
  While there were some strong competitors, the previously renowned Warrior, the Sword King, disappeared without a trace.
 </p>
 <p>
  All the Warriors that emerged after him either fell in ranking or died.
 </p>
 <p>
  Xin Youhwa from China was an Archer.
 </p>
 <p>
  Xin Youhwa, with her unique talent, climbed to the world ranking of 2nd place as an Archer.

 <p>
  Given his experience from his past life, Seong Jihan advised her to become an Archer if she wanted to be the best.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I understand. I was leaning towards Archer anyway. But since you confirmed that you won’t be stepping down, I’ve made up my mind.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “To become an Archer?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, if I’m doing it, I might as well aim for the top.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Having made her decision, Yoon Seah chose the Archer class.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now, shall we resume the weight training?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well… now that I’m becoming an Archer, isn’t this kind of brute training unnecessary?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Brute training? An archer needs strength. Plus, you haven’t fully converted your stamina yet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Currently, Yoon Seah’s stamina is at +7.
 </p>
 <p>
  She only needs three more to reach +10, so it was time to intensify her training.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh, you devil…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thanks for the compliment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thump! Thump!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan floated the plates in the air and inserted them on both sides of the barbell.
 </p>
 <p>
  As 10 kilograms were added more than before, Yoon Seah deeply sighed and stood up.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Even if I become an archer, there’s no end to this hellish training.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Vrrrrrr!
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment,
 </p>
 <p>
  A vibration rang out from the smartphone that had been left on one side of the training room.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Owner~ I was wondering if you’re available today?]
 </p>
 <p>
  It had been two days since Seong Jihan pretended to be enchanted, and this text was from Joo Eunji.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the message, Seong Jihan realized he might have made a mistake.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Should…should I have texted her first?’
 </p>
 <p>
  He was the one who had pretended to be enchanted, so he should’ve shown her that he was interested.
 </p>
 <p>
  He took her number, but let her be the first to contact him.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Damn… I never lived like this before, so I forgot.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Including his previous life, Seong Jihan had never been the one to contact the opposite sex first.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though he pretended to be enchanted perfectly in front of her, he lacked the follow-up actions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Taking a deep breath, Seong Jihan decided to ask his niece for advice.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah, I have a question about male-female relationships.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Relationships? Wouldn’t you, who just graduated from high school, know more about that than me? Weren’t you… the master of women’s hearts?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m beginning to think that being a master is what ruined me. Let me give you an example.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan explained the current situation to her, using Joo Eunji’s text as a reference.
 </p>
 <p>
  “A man is totally into a woman.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But the man doesn’t contact her first.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, out of frustration, the woman contacts him first. Who seems more desperate then?”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s question, Yoon Seah looked at him incredulously.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this story actually flipped? Is it the man who contacted first?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then obviously… the one who contacted first is the desperate one. The woman contacted first. So she’s the desperate one.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That makes sense, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But is the man really into her? If he was, he should’ve contacted her first, right? When I first entered the academy, I thought my phone was on fire.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “My seniors contacted me so much. It calmed down later when rumors spread about who my father is.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Yoon Seah bragged about her popularity when she first enrolled, Seong Jihan realized his mistake.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If she noticed, Joo Eunji probably picked up on my feelings…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Being an expert in Enchantment, she wouldn’t have missed it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘She might be setting a trap for me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With this in mind, Seong Jihan sent a text.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes, I’m available. Shall we meet today?]
 </p>

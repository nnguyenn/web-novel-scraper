  <strong>
   Chapter 86
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  At a café located on the fourth floor of the building next to Sword Palace.
 </p>
 <p>
  The building where the café is situated also houses the Korean branch office of the Neo Self-Defense Force.
 </p>
 <p>
  In fact, this place had been previously designed by the Neo Self-Defense Force to entice former Sword King Yoon Sejin.
 </p>
 <p>
  The café, which had been maintained since its contract period was still valid, has now reopened after a long time, to firmly capture Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Goddess… aren’t we rushing things too much?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside a private room in the café, Takeda spoke, wiping his sweat.
 </p>
 <p>
  In his hand was a piece of paper the size of A4, shining golden.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can’t believe the Akashic Page has a feature to strengthen the supporting gift…’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was surprising that the Akashic Page, which was worth billions and used for the technological advancement of large companies, had such a feature.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unless one was as powerful as the Goddess, it made more sense to invest billions in technological advancement rather than enhancing support gifts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, Takeda felt anxious, as if he’d discovered a hidden secret.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It can’t be helped. Seong Jihan… it seems my Enchantment is almost wearing off.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even Sword King couldn’t resist your Enchantment, Goddess! I can’t believe it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Being an avatar means my powers are weaker. Even using the Akashic Page, it didn’t take effect properly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But didn’t you say it was successful last time?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, it failed. He didn’t contact me for two days. I had to send the first text.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Joo Eunji gritted her teeth.
 </p>
 <p>
  To Takeda, not hearing back for just two days might not be alarming, but for Joo Eunji, it was an absolutely unacceptable situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Such an incident had never occurred since the Enchantment took effect.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘And his reply to my message seemed insincere.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes, is the time good for you? Shall we meet today?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Too dry a tone for a message from a man in his twenties under Enchantment. If the Enchantment had worked properly, he wouldn’t have replied in such a manner.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to make my move this time.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if it costs a fortune, she plans to use several Akashic Pages to ensure the Enchantment works.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then she’ll quickly take him to Japan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Akari.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Joo Eunji subtly shifted her gaze behind her and called out a name, a woman dressed in full ninja attire sprang out of her shadow.
 </p>
 <p>
  Takeda’s eyes widened.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Even Lady Akari came.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Kato Akari.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the players of Japan’s Diamond League, she was a female player who transitioned to the special class of ‘Assassin’.
 </p>
 <p>
  While she wasn’t selected for the national team due to her lower level within the Diamond League, her unique stealthiness as an assassin gave her many real-world assignments.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ito Shizuru had noticed Kato Akari’s potential as a ninja long ago and used her power to make Akari her confidant.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since then, Akari has been working as Ito Shizuru’s right hand, handling covert operations for her.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you’re here, the will of the main body must be significant.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. The main body in Tokyo has entrusted me with escorting the Akashic Pages. Furthermore, she told me to kidnap Seong Jihan in case things go awry.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kidnapping won’t be easy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He’s at most a Silver Rank player. A ship is also ready at Incheon Harbor.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Akari looked at the Akashic Page she pulled out.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Personally, I think it’d be better to kidnap him with my abilities rather than using that item.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, if Seong Jihan resists too fiercely during a clash, there’s a risk our plan could be exposed even before we get to Japan. It’s better to finish things discreetly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood. I’ll be prepared in case things go south.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Joo Eunji nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  If they failed even after using several Akashic Pages, they’d have no other choice.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Even if the Encantment doesn’t work fully, I can suppress his resistance.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Once they get him to Japan, it’s over.
 </p>
 <p>
  He won’t be able to resist the main body’s allure.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sound of the café door opening was heard, and Joo Eunji signaled to Takeda and Akari.
 </p>
 <p>
  Takeda quickly hid behind the private room’s wall, and Akari slipped back into Shizuru’s shadow.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh my~ Owner. You’re here?”
 </p>

 <p>
  And Joo Eunji, with a different tone from earlier, greeted Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ve reserved a nice place.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan calmly walked in and sat down as soon as he pulled the chair.
 </p>
 <p>
  Right away, Joo Eunji tapped the floor twice with her heel.
 </p>
 <p>
  Tapping the floor twice was a signal she had pre-arranged with Takeda.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Believe in the Goddess…!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as Takeda was about to emerge from where he was hiding,
 </p>
 <p>
  Buzz!
 </p>
 <p>
  The smartphone Joo Eunji had placed on the table vibrated slightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  On the smartphone was a message,
 </p>
 <p>
  [“Seong Jihan has started a live broadcast on BattleTube!”]
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  On his way to the cafe Joo Eunji had told him about, Seong Jihan was deep in thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Continuing to pretend to be enchanted might be too hard, since it’s not my major.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He could pretend to be enchanted in front of Joo Eunji, but it was impossible to keep it up long-term, even just by text.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead of failing to act properly, wouldn’t it be better to get rid of the avatar sooner?
 </p>
 <p>
  If he gives away that he isn’t really enchanted, the hands of Ito Shizuru could reach out to those around him, including Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But getting rid of the avatar is also problematic. They’ll find another way to infiltrate…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lost in his thoughts, Seong Jihan entered a nearby building.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, it’s Seong Jihan…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s happening here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  People inside started murmuring upon seeing Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow… He looks even better in person!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mr. Seong Jihan! Can I get an autograph?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Um… Can I take a photo with you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Some fans even approached him, asking for autographs and photos.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘People recognize me a lot. Do I need to start covering my face now?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Having always been at home, Seong Jihan had never truly felt his offline popularity.
 </p>
 <p>
  But, smiling, he responded kindly,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, it’s fine.”
 </p>
 <p>
  For the first time in this life, Seong Jihan, who had tirelessly done fan service during his America First days, was doing it again.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jihan! I love watching BattleTube! My parents and I always wait for your 12am live streams!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, I’m so curious when you’ll hit 1 million subscribers. Can you show your status window just to me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Haha, I can’t do that. Just wait a bit longer. It’ll happen soon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow, you look even more amazing in person…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm, did I not look as good during the broadcast?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan grinned and asked, the female fan blushed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, you looked great during the broadcast too!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you. I knew that, just teasing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In this manner, Seong Jihan engaged with his fans.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I have more attention than I thought.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He was a superstar online, but since he mostly stayed at home playing games, he hadn’t really felt his popularity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering the popularity and attention he had when he was with America First, his current status felt trivial.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he’s getting this much attention, he thought it might be best to bring the matter into the public eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  He decided to broadcast the actions of Ito Shizuru’s avatar live.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Everyone, I need to leave now. I have to start a live broadcast soon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, really?”nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you shooting an advertisement today?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not an advertisement. Something much more exciting.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ending his fan service, Seong Jihan purchased an item from the Battle Market.
 </p>
 <p>
  [First-Person View Sharing Ticket]
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  An item that allows you to share your viewpoint in a video and broadcast it on BattleTube.
 </p>
 <p>
  A one-time item, with each ticket limited to 30 minutes.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first-person view provided as a basic support to game participants in BattleNet.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ‘First-Person View Sharing Ticket’ was an item that made this possible in the real world.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ticket price was a whopping 10,000 GP and wasn’t used often, but it was the best item for Seong Jihan, who can’t carry a camera now.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There’s a different advantage to sharing perspectives than using a camera.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If Seong Jihan becomes enchanted, viewers can share the appearance of Joo Eunji as seen from his perspective.
 </p>
 <p>
  If that happens, everyone would know about Joo Eunji’s danger.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh my~ Owner. You came?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Joo Eunji greeted Seong Jihan as he entered the cafe room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud! Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  She tapped the floor twice with her heel.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s time.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan immediately used the perspective sharing ticket and started the BattleTube broadcast.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Oh, a sudden live stream?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Huh? Didn’t the game end today?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Yeah, it should have ended at 12 o’clock?
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the unexpected daytime broadcast, viewers flocked to Seong Jihan’s channel.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Oh? Is this from Seong Jihan’s perspective?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Did he use the sharing ticket? The one worth 10 million won?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Seems like it. But why did he suddenly use that expensive ticket?
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, Joo Eunji’s face…
 </p>
 <p>
  …was frozen ever since she received a notification that Seong Jihan started a live stream.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You weren’t enchanted.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I tried to pretend to be, but I forgot to send a text. Ito Shizuru.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Oh my. Who’s Ito Shizuru? I’m Joo Eunji.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Seong Jihan’s words, she replied without changing her expression and sneakily glanced behind.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Takeda. Start.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, Takeda sprang from the wall, holding a paper shining in gold.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Huh, Takeda…?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Why are you here?
 </p>
 <p>
  -That paper…
 </p>
 <p>
  -Isn’t it the Akashic Page?
 </p>
 <p>
  Gripping the Akashic Page, Takeda yelled at Seong Jihan,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mr. Seong! Let’s ‘exchange’ emotions…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Supporting Gift, ‘Exchange’.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Takeda recruited many players in his role for the Neo Self-Defense Force, it was his unique talent.
 </p>
 <p>
  He could ‘exchange’ the ecstatic emotions he felt when he saw Ito Shizuru, whom he calls a Goddess.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as the Akashic Page was about to intensify Takeda’s gift,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hand it over.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan reached out and the Akashic Page flew from Takeda’s grasp to him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wha-What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Akashic Page, worth billions, was about to effortlessly enter Seong Jihan’s grasp due to his Force, but at that moment,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  A female ninja emerged from Joo Eunji’s shadow and caught the flying Akashic Page.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Takeda. I told you to use the Akashic Page beforehand.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, Japanese burst from the female ninja’s mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Huh… a ninja? Is that real Japanese?
 </p>
 <p>
  – What did she say?
 </p>
 <p>
  – She scolded Takeda for not using the Akashic Page beforehand.
 </p>
 <p>
  – …What’s even happening?
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers felt that the ongoing live stream was not ordinary.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Notes:
 </p>
 <p>
  TL/N – Akari talks Japanese, hence the […] format and visible confusion in viewers in the next lines.]

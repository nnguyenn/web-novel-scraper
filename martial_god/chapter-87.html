  Chapter 87

  <strong>
   Chapter 87
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan… you’re broadcasting on BattleTube.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Joo Eunji furrowed her brows.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now it’s certain.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan had only pretended to be enchanted, but in reality, he was not affected at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can’t drag this on for too long.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Korean government isn’t foolish.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a situation where a live broadcast is clearly being aired, they surely wouldn’t just watch Seong Jihan getting kidnapped in the middle of Gangnam.
 </p>
 <p>
  If they waste time here, it will be problematic for them.
 </p>
 <p>
  They needed to handle the situation quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mr. Seong Jihan, you are quite a headache.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Joo Eunji stood up from her seat.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her supporting gift.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were two ways to use ‘Edit.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The first was physical contact.
 </p>
 <p>
  By touching the skin, one could edit the other person’s status without speaking.
 </p>
 <p>
  She had tried this method on Seong Jihan multiple times.
 </p>
 <p>
  And when the other person is on guard like now,
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead of physical contact, there was another method.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Player Seong Jihan, I will ‘Edit’ you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Wooong!
 </p>
 <p>
  The center of the table and the ceiling trembled, flashing in gold.
 </p>
 <p>
  Different from what Takeda had, there were two hidden Akashic pages.
 </p>
 <p>
  Using them, Joo Eunji’s ‘Edit’ was applied to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ito Shizuru’s avatar has added the ‘Enchantment’ status to the user. The target of the enchantment is Ito Shizuru.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ito Shizuru’s avatar has added the ‘Submission’ status to the user. The target of submission is Ito Shizuru.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Messages popped up in the system window.
 </p>
 <p>
  This, all the viewers sharing Seong Jihan’s perspective could see.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Enchantment… Submission?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ito Shizuru??
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ito? Oh shit, no way?
 </p>
 <p>
  – What? Why does she look so pretty all of a sudden?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wow… Damn…
 </p>
 <p>
  – He… Huhhhh…?!!
 </p>
 <p>
  From Seong Jihan’s perspective, affected by Enchantment and Submission, Joo Eunji looked like a goddess without equal.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Stronger than the last time.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If last time she used a single Akashic page to induce Enchantment, Submission, and Blind Devotion.
 </p>
 <p>
  This time she focused on just Enchantment and Submission with two pages, so the pressure on Seong Jihan was much greater than before.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But, knowing this would happen, it’s pointless.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Nameless Divine Arts, Heart Method – Mind Creates All
 </p>
 <p>
  Even with the beautifully transformed Joo Eunji in front of him, Seong Jihan remained unmoved and used his Heart Method.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how much Joo Eunji used her Akashic Pages to try to enchant him, her powers were nothing compared to the Succubus Queen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since he had been wary of her beforehand, he could overcome this.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Huhhh… Huh???
 </p>
 <p>
  – Where did the beauty go?!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Give her back!!
 </p>
 <p>
  – I was watching on my knees, lol. What’s this now?
 </p>
 <p>
  – How can someone look like that?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Stop resisting, Seong Jihan!!
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the viewers’ cries flooding the chat window, Seong Jihan steadfastly used Mind Creates All.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, Joo Eunji’s appearance reverted from a goddess to her regular face.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Edit… Is this Ito Shizuru’s power?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Out of all the supporting gifts he experienced, this is the most overpowered one.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan was thinking this, Joo Eunji’s eyes widened.
 </p>
 <p>
  She had thought he would be somewhat affected, but it had no effect at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Last time, he was at least a bit affected…’
 </p>
 <p>
  She hadn’t calculated this.
 </p>
 <p>
  With such a power, even Sword King Yoon Sejin would have been helpless!
 </p>
 <p>
  “You… What did you do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I see no reason to tell you that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan reached out.
 </p>
 <p>
  To the ceiling and the table.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hidden in two places, the Akashic Pages that hadn’t been completely obliterated were sucked into Seong Jihan’s grasp.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">

 <p>
  Just these two alone were worth tens of billions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since he had come to confront Joo Eunji at the cafe, Seong Jihan decided to take them as trophies.
 </p>
 <p>
  From Joo Eunji’s perspective, they were too precious to be taken away.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I need to subdue Seong Jihan first!”
 </p>
 <p>
  She calmly assessed the situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s fine to buy more Akashic Pages later.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  But if Seong Jihan isn’t captured now, it would be tough to get him out of Korea.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if it means giving up those Fragments of Akasha, she must somehow seize his new recruit.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Akari, don’t worry about the Akashic Pages. Focus on subduing Seong Jihan first!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [I understand.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Akari, who was near Takeda, bridged the space in an instant and lunged at Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Akari’s infiltration was stealthy and swift.
 </p>
 <p>
  The gap between Seong Jihan and Akari was vast, with at least a difference of over 100 levels.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, he’s on the left.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, with the gift of the ‘Shadow of the Sun’, could easily discern the movements of Akari, an assassin with shadow-related skills.
 </p>
 <p>
  Add to that his unique stat ‘Force’, which lets him use all his power even in the real world, and the ability to control space.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, you’re fast, aren’t you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan easily dodged Akari’s dagger and used Force to pull the Akashic Page Akari held.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  – LOL, so damn cool!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Did you see that? We must report it now!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Isn’t Seong Jihan getting kidnapped? I saw that female. She’s Akari, a ninja from Japan!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wow, I saw it too. Akari chose a worthless profession as an assassin? She’s a top-ranked Diamond player.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Is this a real situation? Report it quickly!
 </p>
 <p>
  [Akari, ignore the Akashic Pages! Just focus on securing the target!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Understood!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh! Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Akari, as if to show the difference between a Diamond and Silver Rank, swiftly attacked Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Multiple daggers danced in the air menacingly, and her shadow tried to ensnare Seong Jihan from every direction.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang! Clang!
 </p>
 <p>
  If Seong Jihan hadn’t hastily summoned a black sword from his left hand to deflect them all, he would’ve been sliced apart.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wow… she’s insanely fast.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Did assassins always rock this much?
 </p>
 <p>
  – She’s supposedly the best for espionage in reality.
 </p>
 <p>
  – But Seong Jihan is holding his own against such a top-ranked player!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Hey, I got his autograph just now! Near the Sword Palace building, address Gangnam District 134…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Someone needs to help! He’s about to be kidnapped!
 </p>
 <p>
  When it was revealed that the opponent was Akari, a top-ranked Diamond assassin, the chat went wild.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the actual battle situation wasn’t that dire.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Bless. Strengthen. Haste.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Having activated a set of three self-buffs, Seong Jihan confidently clashed swords with Akari.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Tsk…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang! Clang!
 </p>
 <p>
  Sparks flew as Seong Jihan’s dark blade, Eclipse, collided with Akari’s daggers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Akari undoubtedly had the upper hand in terms of stats.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether it was the speed of their blades or the power felt when their weapons clashed, Akari had a clear advantage.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…This doesn’t make sense.’
 </p>
 <p>
  From a third person’s perspective outside,
 </p>
 <p>
  Akari, as a participant, could clearly feel it.
 </p>
 <p>
  She was being blocked.
 </p>
 <p>
  All her attacks were not just being blocked but also being read completely by her opponent.
 </p>
 <p>
  Am I slower than him?
 </p>
 <p>
  No.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’m much faster.
 </p>
 <p>
  Is my power weaker?
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s not the case either.
 </p>
 <p>
  I can push him back.
 </p>
 <p>
  But… why?
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang!
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though I definitely mixed several faint attacks and launched a proper blow.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  I’m being pushed back.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though I can push, I’m being pushed.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was as if two contradictory statements were coming true at the same time.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  However, when I swing my weapon, I realize.
 </p>
 <p>
  With every blow, I was already within my opponent’s calculation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘How can this be…!’
 </p>
 <p>
  In terms of the game’s rank, even though it’s diamond and silver.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the art of handling weapons, there’s already a clear difference.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  That was the gap in skill being compensated by the user’s technique.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If this is how it’s going to be, I’ll go in with the intent to kill!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Akari pressed Seong Jihan even more threateningly.
 </p>
 <p>
  At first, she consciously avoided the vitals, but now she attacked regardless.
 </p>
 <p>
  She actively carried out ambushes using shadows.
 </p>
 <p>
  But.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang- Cl-clang-!
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s all the same anyway.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even with genuine attacks, everything was blocked.
 </p>
 <p>
  His movements, as if reading into my mind, rendered all my actions useless.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It… can’t be…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Unknowingly, Akari’s strength was drained.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s laughable for an assassin to engage in a head-on battle.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan jeered, Akari’s eyebrows twitched in anger.
 </p>
 <p>
  She didn’t fully understand what the Korean man was saying.
 </p>
 <p>
  But it was clear he was taunting.
 </p>
 <p>
  She can’t lose like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  By any means, she would overpower him.
 </p>
 <p>
  She used her most confident skill.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ninjutsu: Illusion Shuriken.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whish!
 </p>
 <p>
  Black throwing knives flew towards Seong Jihan from all directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some were real, and others weren’t.
 </p>
 <p>
  An assassin’s skill, the Illusion Shuriken, is a perfect mix of illusion and reality.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Seong Jihan had an easy way to counter it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ariel.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Only the last two are real.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You can handle it, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Of course.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel, who boasts unparalleled abilities with shadow powers.
 </p>
 <p>
  She discerned all of Akari’s illusions and blocked all attacks flying from behind Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  From the Dark Sword Eclipse, the shadow flew out to block the throwing knives.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang!
 </p>
 <p>
  With a black sword strike, he pushed Akari back.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ugh…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  – Woah. This is insane. He’s facing a Diamond Rank player?
 </p>
 <p>
  – I even called 112 and 119, petitioned the Blue House asking to save Seong Jihan… was it all in vain?
 </p>
 <p>
  – No, you did good. That’s normal. It’s just that Seong Jihan is crazy.
 </p>
 <p>
  – You can’t insult Seong Jihan!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Dude, that was a compliment.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Feels like they’re going even harder than the Sword King’s fans, right? Lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s fans, who couldn’t even tolerate minor insults, became even more agitated.
 </p>
 <p>
  How could a Silver Rank overpower a Diamond Rank?
 </p>
 <p>
  Clearly, the enemy’s stats are stronger and faster.
 </p>
 <p>
  But Seong Jihan is pushing her back with his unique movements.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Akari…! I’ll boost you. Win this round!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Joo Eunji shouted at Akari, who was slowly being pushed back.
 </p>
 <p>
  Initially, she was watching out of respect for Akari, a Diamond Rank, but the situation changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because Akari was gradually losing her 1:1 duel with Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can’t believe this.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Joo Eunji’s eyes were filled with surprise.
 </p>
 <p>
  But they also gleamed with excitement.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Seong Jihan. You… I must have you.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He broke all predictions.
 </p>
 <p>
  He even overcame the supporting gift ‘Edit’ enhanced by the Akashic page.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was even turning the attack from the Diamond Rank Akari to his advantage.
 </p>
 <p>
  This player is an anomaly.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he’s not captured now, there will be regrets later.
 </p>
 <p>
  Joo Eunji used her last resort.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Player Kato Akari. I’ll ‘Edit’ you and lift the tutorial’s restriction.]
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, what she edited was not Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was Akari, who was restricted by the tutorial phase and couldn’t fully utilize her BattleNet capabilities.
 </p>

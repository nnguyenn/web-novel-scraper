  Chapter 88

 <p>
  [Translator – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  Chapter 88
 </p>
 <p>
  Tutorial’s Golden Rule.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a powerful lock placed on every player worldwide.
 </p>
 <p>
  [All skills and attributes within the game are adjusted and applied in reality.]
 </p>
 <p>
  If the stats from the Battlenet game were directly used in the real world, it would undoubtedly lead to massive societal chaos. The Tutorial’s Golden Rule served as a buffer to minimize this.
 </p>
 <p>
  Editing and unlocking it was an entirely different realm compared to manipulating human emotions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon hearing Joo Eunji’s words, Ariel exclaimed in surprise.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Huh! You’re unlocking the Tutorial’s Golden Rule? Even if you use the Akashic page, I can’t believe that’s possible… That would mean the grade of the supporting gift is clearly SSS rank.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ariel, do you also understand Japanese?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Human languages? I can grasp them easily.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then keep interpreting their words for me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Understood.]
 </p>
 <p>
  While Seong Jihan was relying on Ariel for translation,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Oh… The power of the avatar is insufficient.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Cracks began to appear on Joo Eunji’s skin.
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside those cracks, instead of human flesh, there were golden papers.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Akari. The unlocking time for the rule is 5 minutes.]ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwish~
 </p>
 <p>
  Joo Eunji, made up of Akashic pages, began to disintegrate.
 </p>
 <p>
  As her arms and legs completely vanished, even her torso started turning to dust.
 </p>
 <p>
  She looked down at her body and laughed eerily.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Just keep him alive and bring him to Japan.]
 </p>
 <p>
  […Understood, Goddess!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [See you in Japan, then.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The price Joo Eunji paid to break the Tutorial’s Golden Rule was steep.
 </p>
 <p>
  All 11 Akashic pages that made up her avatar’s body disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Through this, she secured an unlocking limit of 5 minutes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching Joo Eunji fade away with a smile, Akari gritted her teeth.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s because I’m lacking…!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Because she couldn’t suppress Seong Jihan, her Goddess’ avatar had to be sacrificed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Akari, who had seen Ito Shizuru pay a hefty price to create an avatar, found it unbearable how she couldn’t even restrain a Silver Rank.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You… I’ll cut off your limbs!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Akari roared and charged at a blinding speed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Cutting off the master’s limbs?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t need a translation to understand that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The unlocking time is 5 minutes.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s important.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Blinded by rage, her movements were simpler than before. But due to the unlocked rule, her speed became many times more menacing.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can’t control her with Force.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Ignoring even the dominating power of Force that controls space, came the Diamond Rank’s charge.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the distance closed, three shurikens flew out, aimed for Seong Jihan’s limbs.
 </p>
 <p>
  Akari’s intention to cut off Seong Jihan’s limbs was clear from her attack.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, as one shuriken reached close to Seong Jihan,
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  It lost its power and fell to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Absolute Domain works.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Force’s Absolute Domain grows in proportion to abilities.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although every move of Akari became threatening, he could control it once she got this close.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stop resisting pointlessly!]
 </p>
 <p>
  However, it was hard to control direct attacks from Akari within the absolute domain, so he could only slightly reduce the speed.
 </p>
 <p>
  To Seong Jihan, that was enough.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can block this as well.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Rumble!
 </p>
 <p>
  After blocking the dagger, Eclipse’s form distorted slightly, and a massive shockwave exploded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Tables and utensils inside the cafe were completely shattered, turning to dust.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a Diamond Rank’s power unleashed to its full 100%, it truly demonstrated the strength of a superhuman.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Humph!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang! Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  After catching her breath, Akari powerfully pressed on against Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  The attacks rained down so fiercely it seemed like they could be severed from any direction at any moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  From the perspective of the viewers watching in first person, every moment was unbearably intense.

 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  – Sh*t… Isn’t this dangerous?
 </p>
 <p>
  – I can’t even see the ninja’s attacks.
 </p>
 <p>
  – How is he even blocking this!?
 </p>
 <p>
  The attacks seemed like something you’d see in a cartoon or animation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Only the sound of weapons clashing was heard, it was impossible to discern from where and in what trajectory they were coming.
 </p>
 <p>
  The arm of Akari, moving at high speed, was invisible from the shoulder.
 </p>
 <p>
  – He’s up against a Diamond Rank… she’s really insane… wasn’t it supposed to be a quick kill?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Don’t talk nonsense about quick kills, this is a real situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  – What do we do! If Jihan gets his limbs cut off…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Hasn’t the player suppression special forces been dispatched yet?”
 </p>
 <p>
  – They’ve been dispatched!”
 </p>
 <p>
  – Even if they’re special forces, can they beat a Diamond Rank?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang! Clang!
 </p>
 <p>
  The attack was blocked again.
 </p>
 <p>
  The enemy’s dark sword seemed like it would break but did not.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan did not allow even a single blow to land.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ahhhhh…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Akari was going mad.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though her master had given up her avatar to remove her limitations, this was an embarrassment!
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if Seong Jihan used his special power, her stats were clearly superior.
 </p>
 <p>
  But, her attacks kept narrowly missing the mark.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Those eyes…!’
 </p>
 <p>
  While she seemed to be overwhelmingly on the offensive, Seong Jihan’s eyes showed no sign of wavering.
 </p>
 <p>
  No… rather, he seemed to be enjoying the situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  A single wrong move would get him dismembered, but he acted like he couldn’t possibly lose.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll shatter that confidence…!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan had other thoughts.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘We might accidentally damage the building at this rate.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Every time their weapons collided, a massive shockwave erupted.
 </p>
 <p>
  Objects around them had already been turned to dust from the impact.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If there’s this much force, it’s sure to affect the building.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  A fire in the building could lead to a disaster.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan quickly glanced out the window.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were almost no people in the park beyond the window.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should go there.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Though the cafe was on the 4th floor, Seong Jihan didn’t hesitate to jump out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crash!
 </p>
 <p>
  “What the-?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That almost hit me!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the building’s window shattered and fell to the ground, passersby looked up and screamed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Don’t you dare run away!]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the wall of the 4th-floor cafe exploded, Akari flew out at a terrifying speed. Realizing that the situation was dire, people screamed and fled.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is a good spot.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan landed in the quiet park, Akari, who was chasing him, used her skill.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ninjutsu: Illusion Shuriken
 </p>
 <p>
  In the current situation, where her stats limitations were lifted, she hadn’t used this skill fearing Seong Jihan might die instantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Not much time left now…!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Already more than half of the 5-minute limit had passed.
 </p>
 <p>
  She no longer had the luxury to fight while being concerned about her opponent’s life.
 </p>
 <p>
  The showdown was imminent.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sssssss!
 </p>
 <p>
  Numerous shurikens appeared in the air, surrounding Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  [There’s no illusion this time.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking at the dark shuriken infused with shadow energy, Ariel spoke calmly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Only the name was Illusion Shuriken, but this time there were no illusions at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  Has she really overcome the restraint? Is this it?
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Shurikens flew from all around.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Die!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The possessed Akari charged like an arrow.
 </p>

 <p>
  It seemed she no longer thought of capturing Seong Jihan, as her eyes were filled with killing intent.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this situation, dodging any further was difficult.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘We must end this here.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Nameless Divine Skill, Dark Shadow Technique – Dark Soul Vortex
 </p>
 <p>
  The shadow blade, Eclipse, lost its shape and turned into a whirlwind.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dark Soul Vortex whirled intensely, sucking in all the shurikens coming towards Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  […What is this!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Akari felt a chill down her spine.
 </p>
 <p>
  A black whirlwind that sucked in all the shurikens.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a skill completely different from her Illusion Shuriken.
 </p>
 <p>
  The dark, whirling vortex was so ominous and violent that even she, who charged with the shurikens, momentarily halted.
 </p>
 <p>
  She shouldn’t go there.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her instincts warned her.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But still…!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Remembering the sacrifice of her lord’s avatar, Akari mustered her will.
 </p>
 <p>
  She couldn’t give up here because of that vortex.
 </p>
 <p>
  That left arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  All she had to do was cut the left arm that had become one with the sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ninjutsu… Demon Slash!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Akari, holding a glowing dagger, jumped into the enlarging Dark Soul Vortex.
 </p>
 <p>
  Was it trust in Diamond League abilities?
 </p>
 <p>
  In a way, it was a straightforward charge.
 </p>
 <p>
  But.
 </p>
 <p>
  Screech-!
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead of cutting the vortex in front of her, a bloodline was drawn on Seong Jihan’s left arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  A strike that transcends space, Demon Slash.
 </p>
 <p>
  She bypassed the location of the Dark Soul Vortex and slashed Seong Jihan’s left arm from above.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It worked…!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally, a hit!
 </p>
 <p>
  Although her SS-grade ninja clothes were torn by the Dark Soul Vortex and her flesh was ripped apart, Akari didn’t spare herself for the first successful hit.
 </p>
 <p>
  How many times did she swing her sword?
 </p>
 <p>
  Thunk!
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally, Seong Jihan’s left arm was completely severed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Done!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Akari almost cried seeing that.
 </p>
 <p>
  If she had delayed a bit more, she might have lost.
 </p>
 <p>
  But in the end, she was the victor.
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s over, Seong Jihan. Cut off your limbs immediately and I’ll just take your torso to Japan…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  With that annoying shadow blade gone, he couldn’t resist anymore.
 </p>
 <p>
  The intense vortex of darkness would no longer sustain its power.
 </p>
 <p>
  Akari tried to swing her dagger to cut Seong Jihan’s remaining limbs, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  [What…?]
 </p>
 <p>
  It was strange.
 </p>
 <p>
  She couldn’t move.
 </p>
 <p>
  No, she was moving, but her feet weren’t.
 </p>
 <p>
  It felt like being stuck in a swamp.
 </p>
 <p>
  Akari’s eyes trembled as she looked at the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  [What’s this…?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Though the arm was clearly severed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The vortex of darkness didn’t lose momentum.
 </p>
 <p>
  What she thought was a dying vortex had simply changed direction and was now completely binding Akari’s feet.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm, did you think you severed my arm?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, with only his right arm, stepped back.
 </p>
 <p>
  Akari got goosebumps seeing him still smiling leisurely.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What… happened?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Her gaze went to Seong Jihan’s left arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The arm was definitely severed…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon a closer look, the severed part of the arm was covered in a deep shadow, and not a drop of blood was flowing.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Something… went wrong.’
 </p>
 <p>
  And that ominous premonition…
 </p>
 <p>
  Became a reality when Seong Jihan took out a Phoenix’s Arrow from his inventory.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Follow your master. Ninja.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Nameless Divine Arts, Triad of Martial Mastery – Way of Immortals
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Phoenix’s Arrow left Seong Jihan’s hand,
 </p>
 <p>
  It turned into a massive flame and engulfed her.

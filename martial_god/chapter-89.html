  Chapter 89

 <p>
  Chapter 89
 </p>
 <p>
  Whooooosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The white flames of the Phoenix’s Arrow set Akari ablaze in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  True to the Phoenix’s Arrow’s nature, its flames grew even more intense when launched, lighting up with unparalleled fierceness.
 </p>
 <p>
  – He won!!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Is she really dead?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Did a Silver Rank just beat a Diamond Rank?
 </p>
 <p>
  – I can’t believe it! Even seeing it through shared perspective, I can’t fathom how he won. I screamed when his arm got cut off ㅠㅠ Thankfully…
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite viewers sharing the same perspective, they couldn’t understand how the situation had turned so dramatically.
 </p>
 <p>
  The battle was so swift that, to the average eye, it was hard to capture the action.
 </p>
 <p>
  Only after re- watching it in slow motion after the broadcast could they hope to grasp how the battle had unfolded.
 </p>
 <p>
  – But didn’t this broadcast a murder live?
 </p>
 <p>
  – That was self- defense!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Still, someone died. Won’t this cause international conflict?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Should he have just been defeated? Or sent back to Japan with only his torso?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Really, our country should protest against Japan.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Worried about potential legal issues…
 </p>
 <p>
  However, away from the virtual world and in reality, as Akari was consumed by the flames, viewers were fiercely debating the events caused by Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a monumental achievement for a Silver to defeat a Diamond, but given that this took place in the real world, there seemed to be legal ramifications.
 </p>
 <p>
  But…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘She’s not dead.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Contrary to what viewers believed, Seong Jihan noticed that, within the white flames, Akari was desperately clinging to life.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If it weren’t for the tutorial restrictions, I would have finished her with my Lightning Wall technique.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Unique stats like Martial Power and Force were relatively unrestricted during the tutorial, but he couldn’t fully use his abilities like in the BattleNet game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially executing the Advanced Martial Arts from the Nameless Technique. It was challenging. Thankfully, he had the Shadow Sword Eclipse to help.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Haah… Haah…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  From within the flames, a black silhouette rose.
 </p>
 <p>
  [How… How is this possible…]
 </p>
 <p>
  As Akari’s deep, submerged voice echoed, the viewers were in shock.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Holy sh*t, this is infuriating;
 </p>
 <p>
  – How is she still alive after that?
 </p>
 <p>
  – A Diamond without restraints is truly formidable.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Isn’t Seong Jihan in danger?!
 </p>
 <p>
  – He should escape while she’s stunned…
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang! Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mr. Seong Jihan, dodge!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll take over from here!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Along with the sounds of gunfire, the player suppression special forces emerged.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ratatatat!
 </p>
 <p>
  Without hesitation, the special forces started shooting at Akari.
 </p>
 <p>
  Given the immense damage players can cause when going rogue, the response of this force was ruthless.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite players having remarkable abilities, the firepower of modern weapons was formidable.
 </p>
 <p>
  Facing such concentrated gunfire, even the most potent player would have difficulty surviving…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This opponent is challenging.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh! Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Akari’s body turned transparent, allowing bullets to pass through her effortlessly.
 </p>
 <p>
  A unique skill known to all assassins, Spirit Embodiment.
 </p>
 <p>
  – What the… She turned into a ghost.
 </p>
 <p>
  – All assassins can use that skill.
 </p>
 <p>
  – That’s so overpowered. But why didn’t she use it against Seong Jihan?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Using that skill reduces stats. Besides, Seong Jihan can use aura, so it’s more disadvantageous for her.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Oh, I see. Wait, is she… flying?
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoooosh-
 </p>
 <p>
  After enduring a barrage of bullets, Akari’s spirit form began rising, floating like smoke in the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dark Soul Vortex that had been binding Akari on the ground had shrunk, allowing her to fly once again.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I had just a bit more power, that would’ve been great. It’s a pity.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Had the Dark Soul Vortex held her a bit longer, he could have secured Akari’s defeat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “With Silver Rank’s power, this seems to be the limit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan reached out to where the Dark Soul Vortex vanished, leaving only the dark sword, with his fallen arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  The dark sword clung to Seong Jihan’s empty arm, and the left arm began to regenerate quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The nearby player suppression special forces held their breath, watching the peculiar sight of Seong Jihan’s hand forming.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm. It’s working well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the arm was dyed pitch black from the elbow to the fingertips, the state of his left hand was perfectly fine.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Sigh… The master’s crazy idea was actually feasible. To think he’d cut off his own arm.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “At that time, it was the best option.”
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no way to prevent Akari’s deadly attack earlier.
 </p>
 <p>
  His arm being severed by her sword strike was an expected outcome.
 </p>
 <p>
  If cut by the enemy’s blade, the cut would be imbued with malicious energy, and the Dark Soul Vortex from the Shadow Sword Eclipse would quickly lose its strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  [If the sword hadn’t properly merged with the arm, you could’ve lost your body. Humans, being the lowest- ranked species, aren’t they sensitive to physical loss?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Regeneration is the key. We have many good supporters in our country.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan spoke nonchalantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  In his previous life too, as a warrior, hadn’t he lost countless body parts?
 </p>
 <p>
  Complaining about losing an arm now seemed trivial considering the brutal battlefields he had faced since his past life.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan pulled the Sword from the ground with his right hand and looked up at the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  Akari neither fled nor attacked. She was just floating aimlessly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “She hasn’t left yet?”
 </p>
 <p>
  His eyes gleamed menacingly, like a predator stalking its prey.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s resume the Diamond hunt.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Nameless Divine Arts, Footwork Technique – Flashing Sky Thunder Steps
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing Seong Jihan charging towards her like an arrow, Akari’s face turned pale.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘How can there be such a person…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Just a while ago, she almost died.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her ninja outfit being SS- class equipment, and being able to use all of Diamond abilities, she barely withstood that attack.
 </p>
 <p>
  Had she made even a slight mistake, her entire body would’ve burned in pain until she died.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Golden Rule will be activated again… in 1 minute.’
 </p>
 <p>
  She still had strength left.
 </p>
 <p>
  She could face Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Objectively, if a battle ensued, she would likely have the upper hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Can I suppress him in less than a minute?’
 </p>
 <p>
  She was uncertain.
 </p>
 <p>
  And upon confronting the deadly intent in Seong Jihan’s eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  […]
 </p>
 <p>
  She was terrified.
 </p>
 <p>
  If she couldn’t suppress him within that minute, once the Tutorial’s Golden Rule reactivates, she wouldn’t be able to overcome Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  No, it wasn’t about gaining an upper hand… she would die.
 </p>
 <p>
  Akari trembled.
 </p>
 <p>
  She had died countless times in BattleNet, but that was just a game.
 </p>
 <p>
  The concept of death in real life was a completely different matter.
 </p>
 <p>
  She never thought she would die, so she believed she could overcome the fear of death.
 </p>
 <p>
  Facing Seong Jihan’s genuine murderous intent, she realized her thinking had been delusional.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Whiz!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s sword, which had approached without her noticing, grazed her face.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the power of the unlocked Diamond, she could easily dodge and counter.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Akari could only manage to dodge the sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  She couldn’t think of countering.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I… can’t win.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The feeling of defeat was already deep in her heart.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the reason Akari was still there was due to the order given by her master, Ito Shizuru, even at the cost of his clone.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Akari. It’s time. Withdraw from the battlefield.]
 </p>
 <p>
  In her ear, Ito Shizuru’s voice echoed.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was like the voice of a savior giving her a reason, especially since she couldn’t run away.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Understood. I’m sorry… Goddess.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Akari turned around as if she had been waiting.
 </p>
 <p>
  And for the remaining minute, she used all her strength to flee desperately.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whooosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  With a gust, Akari disappeared in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her escape at full power was almost at the speed of light.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Wow. She’s fast.”
 </p>
 <p>
  There was a vast difference in stats from the beginning, so Seong Jihan could only stay behind, unable to catch up, feeling frustrated.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It ended sooner than expected, everyone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wow, this is crazy! LOLGeett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om
 </p>
 <p>
  – Is it real that a Diamond is fleeing like that? Hahaha
 </p>
 <p>
  – I’m so impressed with K- Silver’s class…
 </p>
 <p>
  – What’s with K- Silver? If all of Korea’s silver was that strong, South Korea would have already dominated the world
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wow… I want to donate, but I only have a million won in my account ㅠㅠ
 </p>
 <p>
  – That’s too less for a 10,000 GP limit, bro ㅠㅠ
 </p>
 <p>
  The chat window was rapidly scrolling up.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the minimum donation limit wasn’t ten million won, the chat would have been flooded with donation messages from the excited viewers.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just your sentiments are enough. Because, today, I got the Akashic pages.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan took out the day’s loot from his inventory, three Akashic pages.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wow.. How much did you earn today?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Haha, then it’s different! No need for such donations!
 </p>
 <p>
  – But those Japanese guys are crazy. If they used three Akashic pages… How desperate were they?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Right! It’s so chilling.
 </p>
 <p>
  – But I want to see the Goddess’s face again…ㅜㅜ
 </p>
 <p>
  – For real, she’s so beautiful.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ugh… I should rewatch…
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewers who couldn’t forget Ito Shizuru’s face they glimpsed for a moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a good thing that Seong Jihan used his keen observation in time; otherwise, all the viewers would have become her slaves.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If there’s any charm left in the video, I should delete it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking this, Seong Jihan looked at the Akashic pages he took out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Two of the three pages had been used and had faded gold, but the one Takeda didn’t use was shining brightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thanks to Takeda, at least one is intact.”
 </p>
 <p>
  – Takeda’s only good deed LOL
 </p>
 <p>
  – Was Takeda’s gift ‘Exchange’? I wish that happened to me… I want to feel the presence of the Goddess.
 </p>
 <p>
  – You crazy people… Are you praying for Jihan to go to Japan?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Come on, he can handle it; it’s us who are the problem. Hahaha!
 </p>
 <p>
  He had been trying to get Akashic pages.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s fortunate to get them for free.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though he didn’t kill Akari, he was satisfied with the loot.
 </p>
 <p>
  [★☆Takeda☆★ has donated 10,000GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Mr. Seong… Tasukete…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, a donation message appeared on the channel.
 </p>
 <p>
  – ?? What just happened?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wait, is Takeda still inside?
 </p>
 <p>
  – He’s typing ‘Tasuke-te’ in Japanese. Hahaha
 </p>
 <p>
  – Hey, that’s too localized LOL
 </p>
 <p>
  – What does ‘Tasuke-te’ mean?
 </p>
 <p>
  – It means he’s asking for help.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan chuckled at the message.
 </p>
 <p>
  He didn’t know the state inside the cafe.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed Takeda was trapped.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should capture him as a prisoner.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Flying back to the cafe, Seong Jihan found Takeda pinned under the building debris.
 </p>
 <p>
  With his legs trapped and holding his phone, Takeda awkwardly smiled upon seeing Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “He. Hehe… Mr. Seong.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You don’t look too hurt.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… Not too hurt, but it’s painful… I can’t feel my legs.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “As long as you’re alive.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swooosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Lifting the debris with Force and pulling out Takeda, Seong Jihan said,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, everyone, since we’ve captured Takeda too, that’s it for today’s broadcast.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, he ended the stream.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  The broadcast of that day,
 </p>
 <p>
  Not just in Korea, but in Japan…
 </p>
 <p>
  And even further, it captured the attention of the entire world.
 </p>
 <p>
  In less than 24 hours, the video went viral, surpassing 10 million views.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Shizuru. What exactly is this broadcast?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Among those 10 million viewers,
 </p>
 <p>
  Ito Ryuhei, the Sword King residing in Tokyo, was also included.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Notes:
 </p>
 <p>
  TL/N: Takeda’s Gift, or the Artifact which he used to use ‘Exchange’ is still not clear and there’s almost no context for it for now. There might be some modification to this Exchange later when we find out more.]

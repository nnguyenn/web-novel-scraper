  <strong>
   Chapter 90
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The content of the video broadcast live on the Seong Jihan’s Channel was covered in breaking news across news channels worldwide in no time.
 </p>
 <p>
  [South Korea’s Silver Seong Jihan beats Diamond.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [From the beauty incarnate to an ordinary person. Who is Ito Shizuru?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Is the Sword King’s woman Ito Shizuru? Is their shared last name a coincidence?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Special forces useless in front of players freed from the Golden Rule.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The live broadcast left many in shock.
 </p>
 <p>
  The hottest topic was, of course, the Silver Seong Jihan overpowering Akari, who was a Diamond ranker.
 </p>
 <p>
  – How can a Silver beat a Diamond?
 </p>
 <p>
  – This must be a setup!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Player Seong has always been the top promising player in the world! Last time, he even played with a Gold Rank!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Manipulating videos on BattleTube is impossible.
 </p>
 <p>
  – That Asian appeared in the previous Top 100 match. They became famous by defeating Barren.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ah, the person who cost me $100,000! Has that monster grown so much already?
 </p>
 <p>
  – What is AF doing, not recruiting him?
 </p>
 <p>
  [TL/N: AF = America First]
 </p>
 <p>
  People who didn’t know about Seong Jihan or had only briefly seen the Top 100 match were all abuzz.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, in Akari’s homeland, Japan, she was criticized more for running away than for any other reason.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Diamond running away from Silver… This video will be Japan’s eternal shame.
 </p>
 <p>
  – I knew it since she started her ninja otaku stuff.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Akari is a disgrace to Japan. Don’t come back and commit seppuku in Korea!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Thank goodness she isn’t representing our country. Lol!
 </p>
 <p>
  – At least we’re undefeated in national competitions, so no worries. Haha!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Sword King Daisuke! Lol!
 </p>
 <p>
  Akari was once Japan’s promising Archer, but ever since she chose ‘Assassin’ as her special job, she had a negative image among the Neo Self- Defense Force fans.
 </p>
 <p>
  When asked by a journalist why she chose the Assassin profession, she said she had been a ninja fan since childhood.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just for that reason, she chose the worst Archer profession, the Assassin.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even then, the opinion about Akari among the Self- Defense Force fans was not good.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, after Seong Jihan defeated Akari, the most discussed person was Ito Shizuru.
 </p>
 <p>
  – But who is Ito Shizuru?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Someone already clipped when she was in goddess mode, lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Already added it in my downloads.
 </p>
 <p>
  – That’s yesterday’s news now.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ito Shizuru’s surname is Ito, and the Sword King changed his to Ito. Did she seduce him?
 </p>
 <p>
  – I couldn’t resist if she transformed and tempted me with that face. Lol!
 </p>
 <p>
  Because Shizuru had the surname ‘Ito’, Koreans speculated that the Sword King would fall for her.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Who is Ito Shizuru? Does anyone know?
 </p>
 <p>
  – I’m not sure… But did she bring in the Sword King?
 </p>
 <p>
  – A true Japanese.
 </p>
 <p>
  – It would’ve been perfect if she brought in Seong Jihan too. Too bad.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Aren’t they taking too much from Korea? Lol!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Please seduce players from other countries too. Lol!
 </p>
 <p>
  Most Japanese didn’t seem to know who Ito Shizuru was, but they praised her as a patriot for presumably bringing in the Sword King.
 </p>
 <p>
  Both Korean and Japanese media prominently featured Ito Shizuru.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shizuru? Why her?”
 </p>
 <p>
  It was natural for the Sword King, training at the Neo Self- Defense Force headquarters, to find out about this.
 </p>
 <p>
  After watching Seong Jihan’s video to the end, he left the headquarters with a stern face.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  A massive mansion on the outskirts of Tokyo.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even in an area known as the rich neighborhood, the mansion that boasted the largest size belonged to Ito Shizuru.
 </p>
 <p>
  After awakening her Gift ‘Edit’, she established herself as an unparalleled figure in Japanese political and economic circles.
 </p>
 <p>
  The mansion was completed two years ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  Recently, Sword King, Ito Ryuhei had moved in with her.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shizuru. Answer me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a cold expression, the Sword King approached Shizuru, holding up his smartphone.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the screen was a video of Seong Jihan, paused at the moment Ito Shizuru’s alter ego cast a spell, making her look like a goddess.
 </p>
 <p>
  And her appearance.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ryuhei…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  The woman that the Sword King is looking at right now was identical.
 </p>
 <p>
  The avatar, Joo Eunji, dispatched to Korea had an ordinary appearance.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the Ito Shizuru in Tokyo had a beauty that was nothing short of perfection.
 </p>
 <p>
  A harmonious blend of Eastern and Western ideals of beauty, the aura that enveloped her was irresistibly captivating.

 <p>
  The Sword King came in with rage, but upon seeing her face, he felt his anger melting away.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This can’t be…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if he loved her, he should be angry.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sword King tried hard to suppress his anger, but his heart was already softened.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just by seeing her face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you curious about?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ito Shizuru, seemingly reading the Sword King’s mood, asked with a relaxed smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan. Is it true that you went to Korea to recruit him?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. That’s right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She calmly confirmed it.
 </p>
 <p>
  His excitement at her calmness made the Sword King hesitate for a moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  He stammered and shouted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Why, why? I’m here!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I wanted an excellent player. The more talents, the better, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, you used that… enchantment technique? Don’t tell me. You, on me too…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ryuhei.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Shizuru looked straight into the Sword King’s eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What if I did?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What, what…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If so, what will you do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Leave me and go back to Korea?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swooosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Shizuru approached the Sword King with a captivating smile on her lips.
 </p>
 <p>
  She had a unique fragrance.
 </p>
 <p>
  A scent he couldn’t catch even when he met numerous other women. A fragrance that drives people crazy.
 </p>
 <p>
  No, rather than a particular perfume,
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the unique scent of a woman named Ito Shizuru.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Ah…….’
 </p>
 <p>
  His rage was gone, and only his longing for her remained.
 </p>
 <p>
  He knows it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Getting calm just by looking at her face, getting excited by smelling her scent.
 </p>
 <p>
  He knows that this isn’t a normal reaction.
 </p>
 <p>
  But knowing it, he still falls for it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because it was blissful.
 </p>
 <p>
  She had a more intense addiction than any drug.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ryuhei. Why are you so unsure of yourself?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I am…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan is nothing more than a useful slave to me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That, is it……?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course. I only love you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Shizuru approached the Sword King and stroked his cheek.
 </p>
 <p>
  With that one touch, even his resolve to be angry vanished.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather,
 </p>
 <p>
  He felt a deep guilt for having angered her for no reason.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m, I’m sorry… Shizuru. I shouldn’t have gotten so worked up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s okay. Rather, I feel so sorry… Being with you makes me feel ashamed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, no! Don’t leave my side. I was wrong. So please…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sword King felt his heart sinking.
 </p>
 <p>
  The idea of Shizuru leaving his side?
 </p>
 <p>
  The mere thought was terrifying.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What did you do wrong to me? It’s all my fault.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, no. Didn’t I get angry at you?… I did something wrong.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Getting angry? Is that the only thing you did wrong?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swooosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Shizuru pulled the Sword King’s face closer and sealed his lips with hers.
 </p>
 <p>
  And as a passionate kiss ensued, the Sword King’s eyes became dazed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You doubted my love, Ryuhei.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I told you that you’re the only one I love.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I- I’m sorry.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, for the next 3 days, you’ll have to sleep in the annex.”

 <p>
  “What…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Some might say it’s just three days, but for Sword King, who was with her every night, it was a painful sanction.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have to recreate my avatar, too. You understand, right, Ryuhei?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Fine.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He couldn’t defy Shizuru’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, please leave.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright… I’m sorry about today.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Shizuru, having lightly toyed with the angered Sword King, sent him off.
 </p>
 <p>
  A smirk formed at the corner of her mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He’s such a nuisance.’
 </p>
 <p>
  When casting a spell, she should have incorporated Submission and Blind Devotion.
 </p>
 <p>
  With those traits, anyone would believe and follow whatever Shizuru did.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Sword King, Ito Ryuhei, due to his Obsession and Dependency, was constantly troublesome.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If it weren’t for Ganjang and Makya…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Sword King’s twin swords, Ganjang and Makya.
 </p>
 <p>
  Both the blue and red blades held S-class value on their own.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, when used together, their rank surged to SSS-class, possessing a unique characteristic of the twin swords.
 </p>
 <p>
  And these two swords had a feature called ‘The Defiant One’, which made them immune to the statuses of Submission and Blind Devotion.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But I can’t give up those swords.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Currently, the only SSS- class twin swords available were Ganjang and Makya.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unless a replacement weapon appeared, she had to keep using them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud! Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  As Shizuru walked to the annex, she exchanged calls with numerous people.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, Prime Minister. It’s nothing. You trust me, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Minister of Defense, can I help with something? I’m fine. I just need to take it easy. What about Takeda? Oh… You’ll handle it? Thank you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Chairman, you’re investing again? It’s fine… Just three pages of Akashic Records. It’s not a big deal for me. Oh, you’ve already transferred it? You’re always in such a hurry.”
 </p>
 <p>
  High-ranking officials from the Japanese political sphere were concerned about the incident involving her.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m
 </p>
 <p>
  In Japan, her influence remained undeterred despite the incident.
 </p>
 <p>
  In fact, high-ranking officials competed to support her.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll recover the Akashic Pages I used up in no time.’
 </p>
 <p>
  After ending her calls, she opened the door to the annex.
 </p>
 <p>
  She could replenish the Akashic Pages with donations, but there was still a crucial problem.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The next avatar should be crafted more carefully.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Joo Eunji, the avatar she sent to Korea, was poorly made since it was her first attempt.
 </p>
 <p>
  Due to her inability, she failed to control Seong Jihan and inadvertently exposed her existence to the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, she had to select a better body for her duplicate.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘For that… There’s a perfect body available.’
 </p>
 <p>
  She thought of Akari.
 </p>
 <p>
  After completely sacrificing her duplicate body to unlock the Tutorial’s Golden Rule, the ninja who disgracefully lost to Silver and fled.
 </p>
 <p>
  Akari was no longer of use to Shizuru.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come quickly, Akari.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Her eyes turned cold.
 </p>
 <p>

 <p>
  Meanwhile, after returning home and waking up, Seong Jihan saw:

 </p>
 <p>
  Blinking, he checked the flood of achievement notifications.
 </p>
 <p>
  What on earth happened?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Over 10 million views? What the?’
 </p>
 <p>
  He had expected some attention, but 10 million in 24 hours was astonishing.
 </p>
 <p>
  On top of that, subscribers reached a million.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan had promised to reveal his status when he reached a million subscribers.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I earned 110,000 achievement points overnight.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It hadn’t been long since he decided to gather 70,000 points to add the Archer class.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had already achieved his goal.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Alright, let’s immediately add the fourth class.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan opened the Achievement Store.

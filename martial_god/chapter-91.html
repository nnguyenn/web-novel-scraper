  Chapter 91

  <strong>
   Chapter 91
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was mulling over his options in the Achievement Store, torn between adding a new class and upgrading the achievement store itself.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Achievement Store upgrade costs 250,000 points.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Should he level up the shop and increase the available items? Or should he try to add a previous profession through the additional class option?
 </p>
 <p>
  However, his hesitation was soon ended by the condition needed to upgrade the Achievement Store to LV.7.
 </p>
 <p>
  To upgrade the Achievement Store to LV.7, both ‘Additional Constellation Slot’ and ‘Additional Gift Slot’ must be upgraded to LV.2.
 </p>
 <p>
  The investment required for both the ‘Additional Constellation Slot’ and the ‘Additional Gift Slot’ was 50,000 points each, making it unworthy to spend an additional 100,000 points just for a store upgrade.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Spending 250,000 points to add a class has its risks…’
 </p>
 <p>
  There was only the Archer class left to acquire. If he spent the 250,000 points and only got four basic classes without any other benefits, it would be like throwing those points into the void.
 </p>
 <p>
  But Seong Jihan believed there would be some change.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Considering the patterns I’ve observed from the Achievement Store, there must be something coming.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He trusted the process, for it was the Achievement Store.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’m doing it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, a notification appeared:
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Additional Class Slot LV.3 has been purchased. 250,000 achievement points have been deducted. Now you can change to a basic class. Available classes: Archer. Would you like to select a class?]
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as he chose the Archer, his class slots expanded to four: Warrior, Mage, Support, and now Archer.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan now possessed all four basic jobs.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is that all?’
 </p>
 <p>
  He feared that he might have wasted his 250,000 points, but then…
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  [Special achievement ‘All Class’ achieved! You’ve been awarded 100,000 achievement points. You have earned the All Class. You can evolve your class slot in two ways.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The following options appeared:
 </p>
 <p>
  [All Master: Retain and enhance all classes, applying 1.5 times the job bonus and stat growth rate of each class.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [All For One: Deactivate three classes and strengthen only one class. While stats and skills from deactivated classes are retained, no further specialized skills or abilities can be obtained from them. The strengthened class will have its job bonus and stat growth rate applied fourfold.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Would he evolve into the All Master, enhancing all his jobs equally? Or would he choose the All For One, focusing only on one class?
 </p>
 <p>
  The answer was obvious to Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Mage and Support were chosen merely for their potential. At his core, he was a Warrior.
 </p>
 <p>
  Without hesitation, he chose All For One.
 </p>
 <p>
  A warning appeared:
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Warrior class remains active while all other classes are deactivated. Do you wish to delete the inactive classes? If you do not delete them, they will remain inactive and might be summoned in future battles.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As he had been summoned as a Support to ten towers during the Bronze phase, he might be summoned as other professions in future games.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan contemplated the options.
 </p>
 <p>
  While it would be neater to delete them, being summoned in a different profession might not always be a disadvantage.
 </p>
 <p>
  In level-up stages, being randomly chosen might disrupt team strategies.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, in national or even more advanced Space League matches, they could be a wildcard.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I should keep them.” Seong Jihan decided against deleting his classes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, the status window, where the class slot had been spread out over 4 lines, merged.
 </p>
 <p>
  The original ‘Class – Warrior’ changed to ‘Class – Warrior+3’.
 </p>
 <p>
  “+3, huh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan pressed +3, the Mage, Support, and Archer classes appeared next to it in translucent letters.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So, this is how they’re deactivated.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Simultaneously, a message window popped up.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have met the 1st Evolution conditions for the Warrior class.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [There are a total of 10 jobs suitable for the conditions.]
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a message saying that the first evolution of the class was possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is it already possible?’
 </p>
 <p>
  They should have notified in advance.
 </p>
 <p>
  The status window was subtly unhelpful.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the list of available evolving jobs.
 </p>
 <p>
  Starting with [Knight], there were others such as [Dark Knight], [Paladin], [Martial Artist], [Shadow Warrior] and so on.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps because Seong Jihan could use all four classes, the evolvable classes were diverse.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  ‘It doesn’t seem special compared to the Martial Saint.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan gazed at the 10 classes with a grave expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  In his previous life, thanks to the Constellation ‘Wandering Martial God,’ he had acquired a 3rd Evolution special job: Martial God.
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to its capabilities, the performance of the currently listed 1st evolution jobs seemed quite lacking.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But I still have to choose one.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Whatever it is, it must be better than the current Warrior.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan skimmed through the 10 classes,
 </p>
 <p>
  At the very bottom, a job name caught his eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Third-class Martial Artist]
 </p>
 <p>
  [A Martial Artist full of flaws.
 </p>
 <p>
  Being third-class means there’s only room for improvement.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Evolution Bonus: Stat and skill growth rate related to Warrior class +30% increase / XP bonus 10% increase]
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to other first-evolution classes like Knight or Dark Knight, the Third-class Martial Artist had no ability bonuses.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, compensating for that, the growth rate added was quite substantial for a 1st evolution.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A considerable growth rate for a 1st evolution.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If the effect of ‘All for One’ was also applied, the growth rate would quadruple.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then the choice was evident.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Class ‘Warrior’ has evolved to ‘Third-class Martial Artist’ in the first evolution.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [With the effect of ‘All for One’, the class efficiency increases fourfold.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Class – Third-class Martial Artist+3]
 </p>
 <p>
  [A Martial Artist full of flaws.
 </p>
 <p>
  Being third-class means there’s only room for improvement.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Evolution Bonus: Stat and skill growth rate related to Warrior class +120% increase / XP bonus 40% increase]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Incredible.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan felt the effect of ‘All for One’ and chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’ve achieved the general achievement, ‘Class 1st Evolution.’]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You obtain 5,000 achievement points as a reward.]
 </p>
 <p>
  On top of that, a bonus in the form of achievement points.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although he spent many achievement points to achieve the class, it felt like he had almost reclaimed half.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Only about 150,000 left now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan was checking his remaining achievement points,
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  From his left arm, Ariel emerged in a smaller size.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master, what on earth did you do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can feel the power of the shadow growing even when I’m still. Hmm… I feel it even more since I manifested.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel, who fully emerged from Seong Jihan’s left arm, looked puzzled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You can grow bigger if you want.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Growing big enough to reach Seong Jihan’s chest, Ariel looked at herself, seemingly amazed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is it because of the increased growth rate?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It can’t be this transformative with just a slight increase…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not a slight increase, it’s a significant one. 120%.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You mean it increased by 120%?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel responded as if it was unbelievable.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, I can manifest continuously now. Just by doing so, my shadow stats seem to increase.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really? Then stay like that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  There was such a benefit to becoming a Third-class Martial Artist.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  Unless there’s a special occasion, Seong Jihan thought he should keep Ariel summoned.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just then.
 </p>
 <p>
  Knock, knock!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle… Are you awake?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah knocked on the door.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, I just woke up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a squeak…
 </p>

 <p>
  Entering the room, she waved at Ariel as if she was happy to see her.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ariel’s here too. Why did you get so big today?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m going to be around all the time now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, really? Why?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your uncle has grown again. Now, just by summoning me, my power increases.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow… That’s really overpowered.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though Yoon Seah possessed a formidable gift, she looked at Seong Jihan with what seemed like envy.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, that feeling was fleeting.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But… Uncle, are you okay?”
 </p>
 <p>
  She cautiously examined Seong Jihan’s face and asked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Because of the fight with the ninja? I’m completely fine. Although it’s a shame I couldn’t subdue her.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, not that. I’m worried about that enchantment you were under. Is it still affecting you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It doesn’t affect me. I’m more concerned about those who watched the video being mesmerized. If so, I need to take the video down.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, it was attractive, but I don’t think it has a mesmerizing effect through the video.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah seemed a bit hesitant.
 </p>
 <p>
  It looked like she had something to say but was hesitating. Seong Jihan intended to wait until she spoke, but then-
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just say what you want to say. Don’t twist yourself up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel, who had been watching from the side, hurried her impatiently.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you mean ‘twist’!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just speak.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, right. The thing is…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps thanks to Ariel’s push, Yoon Seah took out her smartphone.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle, can you look at this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  In the video she played, Sword King Ito Ryuhei was being interviewed by a Japanese journalist.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sword King! Have you seen the viral video from Korea? Do you have any connection to Ito Shizuru…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The journalist asked, thrusting the microphone forward, and the Sword King’s face immediately contorted.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was chilling to see such an expression from him, who was known as a gentle middle-aged man.
 </p>
 <p>
  He glared at the journalist as if he wanted to kill him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You. Watch your words. Ito Shizuru is not a name you can casually mention.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… yes…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The one who went to Korea was just her avatar. The real her is with me! Look, haven’t I received the Ito surname?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The journalist was too intimidated by the domineering aura of the Sword King to ask further questions.
 </p>
 <p>
  But he, on his own, began shouting.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan, you arrogant man…! How dare you resist when she sent her avatar? You should have obediently become a slave…! I will personally cut off your limbs and bring you to Japan! Journalist, make sure to deliver this message clearly. Understood?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, I understand!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seong Jihan! Be prepared!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pointing his finger at the camera and showing his madness was the Sword King.
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching this disgraceful display, Seong Jihan frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  “He really went off on live TV. That footage must have spread everywhere by now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah… The internet is going crazy. It confirms that the one who seduced the Sword King was Ito Shizuru. But… my father was also enchanted, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan nodded as if it was obvious in response to Yoon Seah’s question.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sword King, when he was in Korea as Yoon Sejin, had always been calm. He wasn’t the type to get madly jealous over a woman or lose his temper.
 </p>
 <p>
  He certainly wouldn’t have yelled at reporters on camera.
 </p>
 <p>
  “He was definitely enchanted. But he seems to have only been enchanted, without the Submission and Blind Devotion, or maybe something else was added. It doesn’t seem like Ito Shizuru would let the Sword King act impulsively like that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. He really wants to kill me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan chuckled looking at the Sword King who threatened to cut off his limbs.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even with the world’s strongest warrior against him, there was no sign of tension in him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle… But can that Enchantment be undone?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Knowing that her father had changed because of the Enchantment,
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah asked Seong Jihan with a faint hope.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m not sure.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A method to overcome the enchantment…
 </p>
 <p>
  Didn’t they fail to find one in the future, ultimately resorting to a nuclear strike in LA where the Succubus Queen appeared?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan tilted his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not that there’s no way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel, who had been listening from the side, spoke up.
 </p>

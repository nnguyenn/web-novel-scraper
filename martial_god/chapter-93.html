  <strong>
   Chapter 93
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as Seong Jihan began his broadcast, viewers flooded in like a tide.
 </p>
 <p>
  Due to yesterday’s events, the subscriber count had significantly increased, so the surge in live viewership was to be expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wha… already 50,000…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lee Hayeon blinked in disbelief.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not even 2 minutes had passed since the start of the broadcast, yet people were pouring in like crazy.
 </p>
 <p>
  And for good reason.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Revealing the status window as promised for 1 million subscribers, starting soon!]
 </p>
 <p>
  This was the pre- announced broadcast title, and it had certainly grabbed everyone’s attention.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wow!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Finally!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Status window! Status window! Status window!!!
 </p>
 <p>
  – 1 million people gathered so quickly, LOL
 </p>
 <p>
  – Yesterday’s event had a big impact, didn’t it?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Yeah, a Silver Rank player outplayed a Diamond Rank. It even topped international news.
 </p>
 <p>
  People who were curious about Seong Jihan’s status window eagerly awaited, chanting in excitement.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were all wondering about the ability he possessed that allowed such incredible feats.
 </p>
 <p>
  How could a restricted Silver Rank player overpower a Diamond Rank player performing at 100%?
 </p>
 <p>
  Today, this mystery would be unveiled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hello, everyone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan greeted with his usual relaxed demeanor, giving a slight bow.
 </p>
 <p>
  Across the table, Lee Hayeon waved at the camera with a welcoming smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hello everyone~ It’s Lee Hayeon~. Today, I’ve taken on the roles of filming, editing, and interviewing all by myself.”
 </p>
 <p>
  – Why is the guild master doing all these trivial tasks??
 </p>
 <p>
  – Please spend some money ㅜㅜㅠ
 </p>
 <p>
  – Where’s all that hefty rental fee going?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sigh… As those of you who saw yesterday’s event might know, the editor I hired let me down…”
 </p>
 <p>
  – Oh.
 </p>
 <p>
  – So, the editor who used Enchantment was chosen by the guild master?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Then she should be working, LOL
 </p>
 <p>
  – How can she sit there so shamelessly after hiring such a person? Do you realize how much danger Jihan was in because of you?
 </p>
 <p>
  Before fans could start blaming Lee Hayeon, Seong Jihan intervened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s alright. Who would have known that Joo Eunji was Ito Shizuru? We shouldn’t blame the guild master here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  – LOL, true
 </p>
 <p>
  – How would you know if someone deliberately disguises and sneaks in? LOL
 </p>
 <p>
  – It’s Japan’s fault, not hers.
 </p>
 <p>
  – But, how did Jihan know beforehand?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Right? He started the broadcast early.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before entering the café, Seong Jihan, seemingly having a premonition, started a live broadcast through shared perspective.
 </p>
 <p>
  People wondered how he knew of Joo Eunji’s sinister plans, but the answer came quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “She had cast an Enchantment on me before.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh my, really? Owner, when did Ito Shizuru enchant you…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Last time, when we filmed the training session at my house.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah! No wonder she was pushing to film your training session… Back then, I thought she had finally matured, treating guild affairs as her own and I was proud of her.”
 </p>
 <p>
  – So, he had been under Enchantment since then?
 </p>
 <p>
  – That sudden training video upload makes sense now with such intentions behind it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I only pretended to be under the enchantment at that time…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Having narrowly escaped, Seong Jihan explained that he realized something was amiss when she contacted him first, leading him to start the shared perspective broadcast.
 </p>
 <p>
  – So, because of a message, everything went off course? LOL
 </p>
 <p>
  – Usually, people do contact first, LOL
 </p>
 <p>
  – Under enchantment, Ito Shizuru would seem like a goddess, but what’s with the prior messaging? Did she call him nonstop? LOL
 </p>
 <p>
  – It’s good he realized it early. Keeping such a woman in the guild would have been disastrous.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan continued explaining yesterday’s events, a donation message suddenly popped up.
 </p>
 <p>
  [R.E.Gates donated 100,000GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Player Seong. Thank you. Barren was almost affected as well.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Barren? Why Barren…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [R.E.Gates donated 100,000GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [It seems Ito Shizuru enchanted Barren when he visited Korea. He asked for Joo Eunji’s contact. But he seems to have come to his senses after watching yesterday’s broadcast.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was taken aback.
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren’s time at the guild was incredibly short, but when exactly did he get enchanted?
 </p>
 <p>
  Then.
 </p>

 <p>
  [Barren has sponsored 10,000GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Robert, you holy $%^&amp;… Why are you bringing up my story?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Barren has sponsored 10,000GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [When did I fall for it! I’ve never had that happen!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Barren has sponsored 10,000GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [This %^&amp;… So, please just shut up. And this channel starts accepting sponsorship messages from 10,000!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren continuously donated the minimum sponsorship amount of 10,000 GP, pushing Gates’ sponsorship messages away.
 </p>
 <p>
  Being fooled by Joo Eunji must have been a dark memory for him, as he seemed quite agitated.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Owner, I think…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, we believe what you’re saying. We do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  – Lol, Barren’s losing it.
 </p>
 <p>
  – The two Americans are popping off with their donations.
 </p>
 <p>
  – But don’t you think the sponsorship should start lower than 10,000 GP? It’s too expensive. Only foreigners sponsor this channel lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, if we reduce the minimum, too many messages might appear. It could be distracting during battles. I appreciate your sentiment though.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Wrapping it up smoothly, Seong Jihan turned to the main topic.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shall we reveal today’s status window?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan opened the status window, activating the small ‘Status Display’ section below it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Um… Owner, your status is quite extensive, isn’t it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon seeing the vast translucent window that popped up, Lee Hayeon was amazed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing the details inside, her eyes widened in surprise.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the viewers had the same reaction.
 </p>

 <p>
  “When did you reach level 46…? And what’s this Martial Power stat? Wasn’t Force Barren’s unique stat?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing Seong Jihan’s status, Lee Hayeon lost her composure and genuinely seemed excited.
 </p>
 <p>
  A barrage of questions.
 </p>
 <p>
  His status window was completely different from the usual ones.
 </p>
 <p>
  – What’s that stat?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Martial Power, Shadow Sword, Force…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wasn’t Force Barren’s unique stat?
 </p>
 <p>
  – I thought you could only get that stat with two status windows?
 </p>
 <p>
  – But Martial Power… It’s taking up three lines like Force?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Is that also unique? Woah!
 </p>
 <p>
  The number of lines a stat occupies in the status window indicates its rarity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Common stats like Stamina or Strength took up one line.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rare stats available in the Diamond League took up two lines.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet Martial Power and Force occupied three lines.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, Martial Power is a unique stat too. As for Force, it’s the same as Barren’s… but there’s no rule saying only one person can have it, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Barren has sponsored 10,000GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s impossible!! How do you have MY Force, my unique Force?! This is rigged!!!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Even before Seong Jihan finished speaking,
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren was in greater denial than before.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Look at Barren going berserk lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Throwing a million won to argue, poor Barren.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Can’t blame him. Force was like Barren’s signature move…
 </p>
 <p>
  [Barren has sponsored 10,000GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  [What did you do, Seong Jihan!!!! How do you have MY Force!!!!!!!!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you for the sponsorship, Barren.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a fresh smile, Seong Jihan responded to Barren’s frantic sponsorship message.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let me tell you this now. Barren, it would be nice if you could handle the Force better. It’s an ability with endless possibilities, but you only use it to enhance magic.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan reached out to the side, an apple that was far away in the kitchen floated towards him.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  “Now, look.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan clenched his fist, the apple’s peel was beautifully shaved off in mid- air.
 </p>
 <p>
  The peeled skin soon turned into dust and disappeared into thin air.
 </p>
 <p>
  The apple was neatly sliced into eight pieces and lined up perfectly in the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan picked one up and bit into it deliciously.
 </p>
 <p>
  “When you master the Force, see how convenient life becomes?”
 </p>
 <p>
  – Lololol
 </p>
 <p>
  – He peeled an apple with the Force lololol
 </p>
 <p>
  – So, the telekinesis Seong Jihan used was the Force, huh? Wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  – I’ve never seen Barren use it like that?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Yeah, I thought it was just an ability for magical enhancement. He also has a shield.
 </p>
 <p>
  The way Seong Jihan demonstrated the use of the Force.
 </p>
 <p>
  People couldn’t really understand how difficult it was, and just found it fascinating.
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren, who also manipulates the Force, knew very well how challenging such precise control is.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps shocked by the demonstration, he remained silent.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Our Barren… is silent…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Hey… are you okay?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Don’t be so harsh on him, guys. It’s sad ㅠㅠ
 </p>
 <p>
  – Even if he’s pitiable, he’s still ranked 2nd in the world’s promising players lololol. He received a donation of 50 million won just today.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Oh right, who’s worried about who? Hey, are you crying? Lololol.
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers were actually teasing him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Owner, can I eat some too?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course. Let’s eat together.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan continued the interview while leisurely eating the floating apple slices with Lee Hayeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You have two unique stats. Shadow Sword… from the number, it seems like a rare stat?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. That’s a rare stat.”
 </p>
 <p>
  While others can barely get one rare stat even at the Diamond Rank, this person already has two unique stats and one rare at the Silver Rank.
 </p>
 <p>
  – When Ariel said he would pick the Shadow Stat if he won the bet, I wondered what he meant lololol
 </p>
 <p>
  – Now I know why he didn’t choose the Shadow Sword stat!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Did he surpass the previous record with the two unique stats?
 </p>
 <p>
  – He surpassed it way back when he defeated a Diamond Rank while being a Silver Rank lololol.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How did you obtain these unique stats?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can’t explain in detail, but I benefited from a gift that has now disappeared.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… The Shadow of the Sun wasn’t your original gift?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. The previous one gave me a unique stat and then disappeared. I got the Shadow of the Sun by breaking the barrier at the Bronze Rank.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather than going into detail about how he obtained the unique stats, Seong Jihan passed the responsibility to a now- lost gift, the ‘Wanderer’s Insight.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What does the +3 next to the Third-class Martial Artist mean?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “+3 refers to other classes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh… All… classes? How can you get more classes?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “My first gift played a role in that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Going further, only obtainable through the achievement store, like the four class slots, for example.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, you have two titles? How can you wear two?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That too, my first gift played a role.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Regarding the title slot, he again passed the responsibility to the already vanished gift.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ah s**t, that’s not right!
 </p>
 <p>
  – How can a gift be responsible for the title slot, class slot, and unique stats?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Reveal the truth, Seong Jihan!
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers booed Seong Jihan for blaming everything on the vanished gift, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  – If Jihan says so, then it’s true. Why the fuss?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Exactly~ We should be thankful that he even revealed his status~ Why demand an explanation~~ ^^;
 </p>
 <p>
  – He said it’s because of the Gift. Just accept it!
 </p>
 <p>
  Fans of The First defended him fiercely against the general viewers, causing a chat war.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the chat was about to turn into chaos, Seong Jihan was unfazed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can’t mention the Achievement Store.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Technically, thanks to the Wanderer’s Insight, he managed to survive and even return, so he wasn’t entirely lying.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I believe this should satisfy your curiosity about my status window.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Owner… Honestly, my questions have only increased…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Leave the remaining questions to your deductive skills. That’s it for today’s broadcast.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, Seong Jihan ended the broadcast.
 </p>
 <p>
  His status window quickly became the hottest topic in the global BattleNet community.
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching these fervent reactions, Barren exclaimed,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shit!!!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Crash!
 </p>
 <p>
  He smashed his glass of alcohol.
 </p>

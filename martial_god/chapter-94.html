  Chapter 94
 </h3>
 <p>
  [Translator – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Chapter 94
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  – There was a reason why Seong Jihan was rampaging alone.
 </p>
 <p>
  – But is such a stat possible at Level 46?
 </p>
 <p>
  – All because of the lost Gift!! :- )
 </p>
 <p>
  – Even with just a single unique stat, Barren was once hailed as the world’s most promising, lololol.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Now, Barren will never be the world’s top prospect again.
 </p>
 <p>
  – He was even pushed back with what he thought was his ability, have you seen him cutting an apple?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Obviously. If that’s how you utilize it… Barren can’t even do it in his dreams.
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren threw his glass after reading the comments from Americans on Seong Jihan’s article.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who can’t do that little trick!”
 </p>
 <p>
  He didn’t use his Force like telekinesis because there was no real need!
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s just a trivial skill that he can do if he really wants!
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren, whose face turned red with excitement, reached down.
 </p>
 <p>
  The object he intended to lift was the shattered glass.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps because of his desperate will.
 </p>
 <p>
  The broken glass started to float, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  “See…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Before the elated Barren could finish,
 </p>
 <p>
  Crash!
 </p>
 <p>
  The glass shattered.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a failure in the fine control of the Force.
 </p>
 <p>
  Zap- Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  The ceiling light also broke, and sparks flew.
 </p>
 <p>
  Debris from the broken light fell towards Barren, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks to the absolute protection of his Force, he was unharmed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  But even if he wasn’t physically hurt,
 </p>
 <p>
  There was a scratch on Barren’s pride.
 </p>
 <p>
  He couldn’t…
 </p>
 <p>
  Even lift the glass shards.
 </p>
 <p>
  The fine control Seong Jihan showed when cutting the apple, he couldn’t even fathom doing it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘How the hell did he do it?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren bit his lip.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before he met him, life was smooth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Possessing a unique stat that no one in the world had, he firmly believed he would someday be ranked number one in the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, since meeting him in the Top 100 promotion match,
 </p>
 <p>
  His sky- high confidence was waning.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Seong will be number one in the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  – I wouldn’t have bet a million dollars on Barren if his status had been disclosed earlier…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Now everyone will bet on Seong, no more betting for me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shit…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Comments on the article pierced his pride even more.
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren cursed, then slumped onto his desk, soon drifting to sleep.
 </p>
 <p>
  And in Barren’s dream,
 </p>
 <p>
  He faintly remembered seeing Joo Eunji at the guild’s lobby.
 </p>
 <p>
  Startled!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing her, Barren jolted awake.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ever since it was revealed she was a clone of Ito Shizuru, he thought he had let go.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the goddess-like face he saw in Seong Jihan’s video kept lingering in his mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even troubling in dreams…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The worst spy manipulating people was Ito Shizuru.
 </p>
 <p>
  Trying to push her out of his mind, Barren rose from the desk.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Barren. There’s an offer from the Daegi Guild.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Robert Gates reached out.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">

   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  “How dare they make an offer to me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ignoring the fact he approached Seong first, still thinking Seong Jihan intentionally humiliated him in the broadcast yesterday, Barren responded.
 </p>
 <p>
  [They’re asking if you’d like to join them in taking down Count Naseed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What… Count Naseed?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon hearing the Daegi Guild’s proposal from Robert, his face turned stone-cold.
 </p>
 <p>
  Count Naseed, who only appears in the Invasion – Valley of the End map.
 </p>
 <p>
  But in the Silver Rank map, this boss monster never appears.
 </p>
 <p>
  Are they proposing to hunt this boss that’s only hunted in Platinum Rank or higher?
 </p>
 <p>
  Besides,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is it even possible when our League areas are different!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan is from Gangnam Area 1 in Korea, and Barren is from New York Area 1 in the US.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was impossible to form teams across different countries and league regions. How can such a proposal be made?
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Daegi Guild says they have a way. Sophia has decided to participate.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren pondered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Participating in Seong Jihan’s hunting of the Count Naseed.
 </p>
 <p>
  He wasn’t particularly keen on helping someone he disliked.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If successful, that guy will surely take the spotlight again.’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Certainly, that guy must be confident, that’s why he’s suggesting hunting Count Naseed.’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Then I should join in too.’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I will also show my prowess worthy of the Ultimate Mage!’
 </p>
 <p>
  With that thought, Barren replied to Robert.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I will participate.”
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  After successfully eliminating Joo Eunji, who was poised to grow as a dark presence within the Daegi Guild, Seong Jihan turned his attention to the BattleNet mission.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m
 </p>
 <p>
  The challenge he faced was the linked quest of the Invasion map, “Valley of the End.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Linked Quest – Trace of the Apostle(2)]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Apostle, belonging to neither light nor dark, watches the clash of the two factions, hiding beneath a deep lake.
 </p>
 <p>
  The cunning apostle, ‘Count Naseed’, will act upon seeing the weapons of the Archangel and the Death Reaper break.
 </p>
 <p>
  Throw both the fragments into the lake to pull the Count out of the lake and subdue him.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Reward: Veil of Void / Achievement points 50,000]
 </p>
 <p>
  The “Valley of the End” map evolves according to the player’s league level.
 </p>
 <p>
  The map gets larger, the minions become stronger, and there are changes in the jungle for each level.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the Gold League map, a named monster “Drake” appears by the stream below.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the Platinum League map, alongside Drake, the boss monster Count Naseed appears.
 </p>
 <p>
  Count Naseed is a boss that requires a coordinated attack by five Platinum members. Asking a Silver to subdue it was virtually an impossible mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, having consistently tackled such impossible missions, Seong Jihan wasn’t feeling daunted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Still, I need teammates to hunt the Count Naseed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If he was at his former world ranking 7th level, maybe, but now he certainly needed four team members.
 </p>
 <p>
  And those teammates should be compatible.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The problem is that I don’t have suitable teammates right now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if they were members of the Gangnam Area 1 Daegi Guild, there were only Lim Gayeong and Diego Masied.
 </p>
 <p>
  And both were still Bronze, so they couldn’t play with him, who’s Silver.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s too risky to gather a public party to hunt Count Naseed…”
 </p>
 <p>
  While pondering, Seong Jihan tried creating a party from the guild menu.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the same time,
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have achieved the ‘League Transcendence’ achievement.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Some party composition restrictions have been lifted.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Player can now party with players one league level below them.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Player can also form parties with players from other regions.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Note: All members must belong to the same guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The ‘League Transcendence’ achievement he earned from the defense game. He hadn’t expected it to come into play here.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘With this, I can include Seah and Masied in the party.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Now high-level players can help level up low-level players, known as ‘boosting’.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, in the BattleNet game system, the opponents will also match the players’ level.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, including a low-level player in the party might increase the chances of losing the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, if the high-level player was Seong Jihan, the story changes.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})

 <p>
  Still, he thought that it would be difficult to boost during this quest.
 </p>
 <p>
  He would reserve boosting for a later opportunity and focused on the second paragraph, which mentioned being able to form parties with players from other regions.
 </p>
 <p>
  With this, he could collaborate with Silver players from other regions that are temporarily affiliated with the Daegi Guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I need to gather a party.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan contacted Daegi Guild members who are Silver players from around the world through Lee Hayeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sophia has expressed her intention to participate right away! She’s really looking forward to the Count Naseed raid!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wang Lin is also participating!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mikhail has also expressed his intention to join!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “And… Barren has also decided to participate! After the fuss he made yesterday, I thought he wouldn’t.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Scarlet asked to contact her in case there’s an opening as the spots are already full!”
 </p>
 <p>
  And the response from the guild members was astonishing.
 </p>
 <p>
  All five rented players expressed their active participation in the proposal for Count Naseed’s raid.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially Barren, who had caused such a ruckus the day before, quickly expressed his intention to participate, defeating Israel’s Scarlet.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really… I have to admit, he’s quick to change his stance.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He has to be! It’s the Count Naseed’s raid! Silver Rank participating in a raid?! He’s going to get a massive spotlight!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The expressions of the five players who had been rented to the Daegi Guild were beyond splendid.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were two with SSS-grade Gifts, and three with SS-grade.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were all top prospects cherished and nurtured in their respective guilds.
 </p>
 <p>
  As such, they seemed to yearn for public attention to make their names known.
 </p>
 <p>
  For such people, the bait of Count Naseed’s raid elicited fervent responses.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Indeed, those who rise to the Top have unique ambitions.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Excluding Sophia and Barren,
 </p>
 <p>
  There were Wang Lin from China, Mikhail from Russia, and Scarlet from Israel.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were players with global renown, vaguely remembered in Seong Jihan’s memory.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, we’ll challenge the Count Naseed’s raid tomorrow. Please tell them to wait until I contact them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood, Owner.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh. And, Hayeon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Once Seong Jihan settled some matters, he opened his inventory and handed a complete Akashic page to Hayeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  “O-Owner, what is this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Akashic page. They have the capability to enhance supporting gifts. Hayeon, please use it to enhance ‘Nurturing’.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do… do you know how much this is worth?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Akashic page, shining brilliantly in gold.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘For me?!’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Does he even know its value?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Hayeon could barely form words, not daring to accept it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t it worth about 300 billion won?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You know… and you’re giving it to me… are you trying to take back the shares?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why would I take back the shares? Keep them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan forced the Akashic page into her hands when she hesitated.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Money doesn’t hold much meaning to me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But still…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “In today’s world where BattleNet rules, developing capabilities comes first. This is an investment. An investment for me. So, don’t feel pressured.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘How can I not feel pressured?!’ Hayeon screamed internally.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s such a waste! To just use it to enhance a supporting gift…!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Wasn’t it thanks to the Akashic page that they perfected the flexible display of the Divergent Guild phone, Space 23?
 </p>
 <p>
  To use such a monumental piece of technology to merely enhance her supporting gift.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hayeon was distraught with regret.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hayeon, why are people from Divergent Guild so narrow-minded?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But it’s 300 billion…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stop talking about the 300 billion. Just use it here. Right in front of me. Now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan gazed gently at Hayeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  Use it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now!
 </p>
 <p>
  His gaze seemed to be forcing the biggest overspending of Hayeon’s life.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Ugh… It’s not me! The owner told me to!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Due to Seong Jihan’s silent pressure, Hayeon finally accepted the Akashic page.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  The golden paper of immense value emitted a brilliant light.

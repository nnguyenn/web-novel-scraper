 <p>
  Chapter 96
 </p>
 <p>
  After changing his job to a Mage, Diego Masied was on a fast track of growth.
 </p>
 <p>
  In no time, his level had already reached 21.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he continued growing at this pace, he would be eligible to participate in the Silver Promotion Match this month.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the other party members were unaware of the changes in Diego Masied.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Sophia: Ah! Mr. Masied! I know you. The God of Soccer! Play well today!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Mikhail: Ah~ That person… Nice to meet you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Barren: God of Soccer? Huh! Seems you brought a fitting person for this situation. Masied, don’t get in the way!]
 </p>
 <p>
  All they remembered was that Masied had received the comical SSS-grade Gift, “God of Soccer”.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia and Mikhail didn’t show any particular reaction, but Barren teased and warned Masied not to mess things up.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Masied: I’ll probably perform better than you, so no worries.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Barren: Show off… Tsk. I’ll look forward to it.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘His attitude is even worse than before.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing Barren picking a fight unnecessarily, Seong Jihan shook his head internally.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If Masied had been at the same level, he would have beaten Barren. Such a pity.’
 </p>
 <p>
  After the tutorial, if you had to pick the two best Mages, it would be Barren and Diego Masied.
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren was a classical type of mage who dealt enormous damage from the rear.
 </p>
 <p>
  In contrast, Diego Masied gave off the vibe of a Battle Mage with his agility and movements rivaling those of warriors.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
 </p>
 <p>
  In strategy, their strengths depended on the map they played on.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But if I had to choose one between the two, I’d go with Masied.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Diego Masied boasted insane controls, unlike Barren who couldn’t even use half his power properly.
 </p>
 <p>
  As of now, Barren might be acting arrogantly, but once Masied starts pursuing seriously, Barren’s laughter won’t last long.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Seong Jihan: Let’s try again.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan restarted the game with the current party, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  [The average power of the party is excessively high. You are matched with the New York Area 1 Gold League map.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Would you like to start the game?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Sophia: Gold again?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Barren: Tsk. Seems I’m too strong!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Mikhail: This won’t be easy…]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is ridiculous!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even with a bronze player in the party, they’re still matched against gold?
 </p>
 <p>
  It was beyond understanding, but there was no other option.
 </p>
 <p>
  After a round of selection, Mikhail exclaimed, “I lost again?!” and left the party.
 </p>
 <p>
  The person who replaced him was…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yoon Seah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh? Me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s no other way. You haven’t played today, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes… But still.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan invited Yoon Seah, who had been watching the party formation. Finally…
 </p>
 <p>
  [You are matched with the New York Area 1 Silver League map.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Would you like to start the game?]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Finally, it’s working.’
 </p>
 <p>
  To play in the Silver League map, they needed two bronze players. It was a system with many restrictions.
 </p>
 <p>
  And so, Seong Jihan ended up forming a party with three silver players and two bronzes.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Barren: Ha! We have to carry these two burdens.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Sophia: Jihan… Can we win?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Seong Jihan: Of course.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though Yoon Seah wouldn’t be of any help in terms of strength,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘One vacancy can be covered sufficiently.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As long as Masied does his part, they should be able to win. Seong Jihan recalled the strategy against the Viscount and started the game.
 </p>
 <p>

 <p>
  [You have been summoned to the Valley of the End.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You are in the Demon Faction.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Assist the demons and conquer the Angel Faction.]
 </p>
 <p>
  – Oh. It’s starting.

 <p>
  – It’s the Invasion map.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Seong Jihan will probably roam the jungle and decimate them again.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Who will be today’s player to board the Seong Jihan Express?
 </p>
 <p>
  [TL/N: Referring to how Seong Jihan solo-carried people in his party.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the broadcast started with Seong Jihan, viewers immediately flooded in.
 </p>
 <p>
  They had expected to see a pentakill show after a long time, upon seeing the Invasion map.
 </p>
 <p>

 <p>
  – ???????
 </p>
 <p>
  – The team members… seems strange?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Isn’t that Barren?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Sophia’s there too. Huh, Yoon Seah? Why is a Bronze Rank player here?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Even Diego Masied is present. Amazing.
 </p>
 <p>
  The chatbox quickly turned chaotic upon seeing Seong Jihan’s party members.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hello, everyone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Before the game started, Seong Jihan briefly explained the situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Today, we are going to hunt down Count Naseed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  – Count Naseed?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Isn’t that from the Platinum League map?
 </p>
 <p>
  – How can you catch that in a Silver League map?
 </p>
 <p>
  – How did you form your party like this, Jihan?
 </p>
 <p>
  “The method to summon and defeat the Count will be clear soon. As for the party… you all know I transcended the league last time? I owe it to that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  – How can transcending the league allow you to form a party like this?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wow, it’s like he’s playing a totally different game.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not a different game. If others achieve the first place more than 40 times like me, they could do the same.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan openly told viewers how he could form the party like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Oh~ I see~
 </p>
 <p>
  – LOL, the secret revealed! Just achieve 1st place 40 times? Seems easy, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wow! So easy! So fun!
 </p>
 <p>
  The audience responded enthusiastically.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So… transcending the league allows one to form a party like this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, you should try it too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After his last broadcast, Barren, who consistently spoke informally, received a sarcastic reply from Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s decide the lanes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He sent Sophia and Masied to the top lane, Barren to mid, and himself and Yoon Seah to the bottom lane.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll first push the enemy team back to their base, secure a 200% buff, then try to take down Count Naseed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright. I’ll push the tower first.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren confidently headed to mid.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll be in your care, Masied.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just make sure to buff me on time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Masied and Sophia headed to the top lane, Seong Jihan turned to Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow, I never expected to play in a party with my uncle! It’s such a symbolic day!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I feel the same! It’s great to party with my niece.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In his past life, Seong Jihan could never have dreamed of such a situation. It felt surreal.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But Seah,” he remarked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t your armor a bit light?”
 </p>
 <p>
  True to his words, Yoon Seah wore a tight leather armor, looking much lighter compared to the full plate mail she often wore for training.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, today’s not for training, it’s the real deal. So, I dressed according to my class.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Training in a Silver League map is more efficient, though. Change into full armor now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What… You want me to train again?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, we’re almost there.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan said, Yoon Seah was close to acquiring the rare Perseverance stat.
 </p>
 <p>
  In comparison to before, the now much-improved Yoon Seah needed just 1 more Stamina points to gain the Perseverance stat.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Also, in this mission, you might need to defeat Count Naseed and force a game end.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan discreetly communicated this to Yoon Seah, who blinked in surprise.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Forcing an end would inevitably place her last. Why would he suggest that?
 </p>
 <p>
  [Why?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You can’t exceed level 10. You need to gain the Perseverance stat.]
 </p>
 <p>
  To obtain the rare Perseverance stat, one had to increase their health by 10 through training without exceeding level 10 within 100 days.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although defeating Count Naseed would not directly raise her by 4 levels, completing the Invasion map and moving to the settlement phase might push Yoon Seah beyond level 10 due to the significant gap between the map and her current level and skills.
 </p>
 <p>
  [But if you increase your stamina by 1, you don’t have to force quit.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ah… is that so?! Got it!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah, convinced by Seong Jihan’s words, obediently wore the full plate mail from her inventory.
 </p>
 <p>
  It used to look very heavy, but perhaps because her stats had increased recently, it didn’t seem too burdensome.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It looks light on you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve gotten stronger.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good. Then. Ariel. Can you attach to Seahh and increase the weight?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Understood.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  From Seong Jihan’s left arm, a dark energy erupted, sticking to Yoon Seah’s armor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, her movements suddenly became sluggish.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh? Wait, wait. Why is it so heavy! I can’t move!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re exaggerating. You can handle it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, I’m not exaggerating…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you think I don’t know the limit of the lowest-ranked species? I’ve considered everything.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud! Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  With every step Yoon Seah took, the ground indented.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s increase stamina by 1, just one! Seah, you know your uncle’s intentions, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, I get that part, but…ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now, don’t walk to the bottom tower, run. I’ll go ahead and set up the line, okay?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, watching her with satisfaction, waved and disappeared first.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wow, there really was a devil here lol.
 </p>
 <p>
  – He came to catch Count Naseed but still carefully manages her stats lol
 </p>
 <p>
  – Crazy love for his niece…
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan arrived first at the bottom lane.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hello, Mister Seong.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Welcome to the New York League.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He then saw two Americans from the New York League greeting him in English.
 </p>
 <p>
  Two players with a noticeable orange mark slightly smeared on their armor.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Those are from the Orange Guild.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Ranked second in the US after America First, they were players from the Orange Guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re here to catch Count Naseed? It’ll be tough. Want our help?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How about the Angel and Demon Factions raiding simultaneously?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just lose to us in the game. We need to win this one to move up in rank.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, you don’t understand English? Should I type it in the chat?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at the two players speaking so casually and said,
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s fine.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He swiftly swung his Phoenix’s Arrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nameless Divine Art, Triad of Martial Mastery – Total Annihilation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The two players, who were near the tower, were instantly split in half.
 </p>
 <p>
  [First Kill!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Double Kill!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Player Seong Jihan has recorded the first kill.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan effortlessly achieved a double kill.
 </p>
 <p>
  – People seem like jelly to him…wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  – The New York League isn’t that big of a deal?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, who had been top-ranked in Gold League maps and had even made a Diamond Rank kneel, wasn’t going to be tripped up by mere Silver Rank players.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should clear up a bit before Seah arrives.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He had told Yoon Seahh to run, but given the weight she was bearing, it would probably take her a while.
 </p>
 <p>
  He should incapacitate the resistance before she arrives.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan thought this as he waited for his defeated opponents to return to the lane, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The first to arrive was unexpectedly,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hah… Hah…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah.
 </p>

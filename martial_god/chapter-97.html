  Chapter 97

 <p>

 <p>
  <strong>
   Chapter 97
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huff… Huff… I’m really gonna die…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Woah… How did you get here so quickly?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan gazed at Yoon Seah, who sat down catching her breath, with a tilted head.
 </p>
 <p>
  Judging by the footprints behind her, the weight of the armor seemed to be the same as before.
 </p>
 <p>
  Could it be…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle. It seems like the silver map really is beneficial.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Grin~
 </p>
 <p>
  While still seated, Yoon Seah made a ‘V’ sign with her fingers.
 </p>
 <p>
  “My stamina has increased.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You didn’t, by any chance…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, I finally achieved my ‘goal’!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Maybe it was due to the ‘Focused Growth’ that Lee Hayeon obtained.
 </p>
 <p>
  In that short span of time, Yoon Seah’s stamina had already increased by 1.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So, her stamina has transformed into Perseverance.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even with the weight added by Ariel, seeing her run like that made it clear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her stamina had undoubtedly transformed into the rare stat ‘Perseverance’, which is twice as efficient.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good. Then, take off that armor and get ready for battle.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As if she had been waiting, Yoon Seah unequipped her full plate mail and picked up her bow.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Time to seriously level up!”
 </p>
 <p>
  With an arrow drawn from her inventory and set on the bowstring, Yoon Seah was burning with enthusiasm.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now that she had gained Perseverance, only rapid leveling up was left.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright. Today, I’ll take the lead and help you grow.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course. I’ll bring the minions, you just shoot.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a relaxed expression, Seong Jihan reached out towards the small army of minions, shaped like angels.
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, the shadow of the minions transformed into swords, stabbing them from behind.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud! Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  Unable to move with swords lodged in their chests, the group of minions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although small in size, they were as powerful as level 50 silvers.
 </p>
 <p>
  But they couldn’t resist Seong Jihan’s shadow swords.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Without taking a step, Seong Jihan subdued the enemy troops.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, using Force, he dragged the skewered minions to Yoon Seah, lining them up in front of her.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shoot each one of them. Just give the finishing blow.”
 </p>
 <p>
  – This is super easy.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Talk about being carried LOL.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Just carry? This is hard carry!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Getting levels for free.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah excitedly shot arrows at the dying minions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Normally, bronze arrows would have been deflected by the minions.
 </p>
 <p>
  But, immobilized by the shadow swords, they fell one by one.
 </p>
 <p>
  After killing about ten of them…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow, I’ve already leveled up!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you level 7 now? Let’s aim to surpass 10 today.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m up for it! Hehe.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Before defeating Count Naseed and accumulating a 200% buff during their spare time,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan was determined to raise Yoon Seah’s level as much as possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t this a bit too overpowered?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, earlier was just for fun. Why don’t we just try Count Naseed together?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The two players, who were killed by Seong Jihan and later revived, returned to the line and proposed that idea to him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, just give my niece some experience.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  Like he did with the minions, Seong Jihan dragged the two players over and presented them to Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Damn…! This, this is unsportsmanlike!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uncle, they’re saying you’re being unsportsmanlike?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s fine. The ones who came back here are the ones at fault.”
 </p>
 <p>
  – I agree…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Yeah, coming back after being defeated was their mistake LOL.
 </p>
 <p>
  There wasn’t any reason to hear someone as rude as them.
 </p>
 <p>
  The important thing is to level up Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan gestured, lightly running his finger across his throat,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh~ Then I won’t refuse!”
 </p>

 <p>
  Yoon Seah passionately fired arrows at the two who became her targets.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Damn!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ll regr…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The two players died with fierce expressions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… seriously!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This isn’t right!”
 </p>
 <p>
  In the second round, they tried to switch lines but were hopelessly suppressed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can’t we even hit the minions?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I want to avoid being the worst in our team…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite having towered in a different line for the third time, they were pulled without resisting, and instead of getting angry, they pleaded to at least let them hit the minions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We don’t have that luxury. Seah’s level has already reached 10.”
 </p>
 <p>
  But Seong Jihan was firm.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please respawn quickly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Damn it…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Forget it. I’m not playing anymore!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  Raising their middle fingers, the two defeated players.
 </p>
 <p>
  After experiencing their third death, they never returned to the line.
 </p>
 <p>
  They simply decided to give up on this game.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seah, how much buff have you accumulated?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “150%. 200% is the max, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mmm. It’ll end soon then. I’ll roam the jungle. Ariel will help you get the remaining 50%.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan summoned Ariel on the lane where the enemy players gave up.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  “Take care of Seah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood, master. Can I push the tower?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, let’s start taking them down.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As a preparation to defeat Count Naseed.
 </p>
 <p>
  They needed to push the enemies back to their base.
 </p>
 <p>
  They had delayed to level up Yoon Seah, but now it’s time to make a move.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright. I’ll start the push.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel said confidently, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Angel Faction’s 1st tower has been destroyed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The message that a tower was destroyed appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  And it wasn’t the mid that Barren was in, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  “…How?”
 </p>
 <p>
  It was in the top lane where Masied was.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  “What… Who is this guy?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia looked at Masied in disbelief.
 </p>
 <p>
  Masied, the ‘God of Soccer.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He possessed a rare SSS-grade Gift, but due to the restriction that he must always have a soccer ball at his feet, he fell from being the world’s most revered soccer player to a laughingstock.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I wasn’t expecting anything because he’s often mentioned as a failed case of an SSS- grade… This is insane.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The guild, now filled with the world’s most promising players, wondered why someone like Masied was there. Now she realized why.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Fireball.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A Fireball.
 </p>
 <p>
  A common attack spell thrown by low-level wizards.
 </p>
 <p>
  But when Masied unleashed it, it was entirely different.
 </p>
 <p>
  The soccer ball at his feet ignited into a blazing red and swelled to an immense size.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was no longer just a ball but a huge boulder.
 </p>
 <p>
  Masied trapped the massive fireball with ease using his foot and then kicked it towards the enemy lines.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Crazy… Shield! Shieeeld!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah! The shield’s melting! Why is a Bronze so strong!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Was Sophia’s buff that good?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No! It’s not that overpowered!”
 </p>
 <p>
  It must be because they’re both from the New York 1 area.
 </p>
 <p>
  Guild members from Orange who know about Sophia’s buff.
 </p>
 <p>
  They tried hard to block Masied’s fireball, but they were soon engulfed by the flaming mass.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The buff…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, yes!”
 </p>
 <p>
  With Masied’s command, the extinguished ball returned.
 </p>
 <p>
  He leisurely enchanted the ball, suppressing the minions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite being in the 20s level Bronze range, Masied was leading the battle all by himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He moves incredibly fast.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The minions he was dealing with were much higher in level.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, Masied evaded their attacks effortlessly, approaching them and using his magic.
 </p>
 <p>
  While mages usually keep their distance, Masied, on the other hand, closed in.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll push slowly. Lightning.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzzt!

 </p>
 <p>
  This time, an orb infused with electricity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom! Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  Masied subdued the minions one by one, like passing a ball.
 </p>
 <p>
  While it didn’t seem more powerful than the fireball, the skill with which he controlled each one was exceptional.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia unconsciously let out words of admiration.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was clear that Masied was once the ‘God of Soccer’ who once enraptured the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is this what mastery is?’
 </p>
 <p>
  A lonely craftsman, thinking only of soccer.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even that unkempt, rough beard might have been due to his singular focus on soccer, neglecting everything else.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as she was having such generous thoughts about Masied,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hm?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Masied, who was busily kicking the ball, suddenly stopped.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you, Kim Seongyong, for the 100GP donation. Thank you, Lee Jiseong, for the 200GP donation. Thank you, Park Youngpyo, for the 300GP donation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Masied, expressing gratitude for each donation in slightly awkward Korean.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia tilted her head upon seeing this.
 </p>
 <p>
  She didn’t understand the Korean words, but the way he kept bowing into thin air seemed like he was showing appreciation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is he getting a lot of donations?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren would just nod whenever he received donations.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Despite his daunting look, he’s quite polite.’
 </p>
 <p>
  That was a good thing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, even as Sophia viewed him favorably,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even when surrounded by minions, Masied kept repeating his thanks, making her feel increasingly restless.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Masied! What are you doing? We’re surrounded!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have to thank for the donations.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You have to limit it during battle!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He gave me 100GP, how can I cut it off?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “100GP? Just for that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you know how hard it is to earn 10,000 won? Ah, a mission…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Masied, who had been looking at Sophia as if she was an immature kid, had a viewer mission drop in front of him.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yoon Heungmin has sent a viewer mission.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Destroy the first tower.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Reward: GP 3,000]
 </p>
 <p>
  “3…3,000GP?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Masied looked at the channel mission and immediately bowed 120 degrees.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Th-thank you! The first tower is now mine!!!”
 </p>
 <p>
  His voice was more polite than ever.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the eyes beneath his bowed head were burning with fervor.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Supporter. Full buff! Quick!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wh-why?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “3,000GP! I’ll take down the first tower! Fireball! Lightning! Magic missile!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Masied started pouring all his magic into the orb.
 </p>
 <p>
  The orb swelled up as if it would explode, merging the three spells.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Quick! Buff!!!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  With Sophia’s buff, Masied began to vigorously attack the tower.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang! Bang! Crash!
 </p>
 <p>
  A magical mass as large as a house struck the tower.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the game, a tower known to be tough beyond measure.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, as Masied’s orb hit the tower again and again like rapid-fire artillery,
 </p>
 <p>
  Crash!
 </p>
 <p>
  In an instant, over half of its form crumbled and it was turning to rubble.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What? It’s really breaking…?’
 </p>
 <p>
  But,
 </p>
 <p>
  He’s just bronze, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if it’s a full buff, even if there’s an SSS-tier gift.
 </p>
 <p>
  Is the tower allowed to be shattered this soon?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Destroyed!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Crash!
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking at the completely obliterated tower, Sophia looked at Masied with a meaningful gaze.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Robert will go all out for him.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A player who bows several times even for a small donation, urgently in need of money.
 </p>
 <p>
  For recruiting such a person, there was no one like Robert Gates, the chief scout of America First.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you, Yoon Heungmin! 3,000GP! Really appreciate it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching Masied react in Korean after completing the mission, Sophia smiled faintly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘We might soon belong to the same guild.’
 </p>
 <p>
  To her, unaware that Masied owed debt to Seong Jihan, it was an obvious judgment.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  As time passed,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s catch up now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Having completely cornered the enemy and gathered all 200% buffs, Seong Jihan’s party gathered near the valley where Count Naseed was hiding.
 </p>

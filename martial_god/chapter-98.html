  <strong>
   Chapter 98
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren, who just arrived and was waiting for the other party members, was surprised when he saw Sophia’s group arrive before him from the tower.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sophia. Seems you’ve exerted some effort. Destroying the first tower. Even if I was leisurely playing in the mid.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Masied did most of it. Well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Heh. A bronze player?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ll be surprised when you see for yourself.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Still, he’s just a ‘God of Soccer’… Humph.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Maybe he was irked that they destroyed the tower before him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren half-heartedly picked a quarrel, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you for the 100GP, Lim Gangin.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Masied, however, showed no interest, busy expressing gratitude for the donations.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan said he would hunt Count Naseed, this game attracted much attention.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the inclusion of American superstars Barren and Sophia in the party, not only Koreans but also international viewers gathered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps due to the large audience, Masied’s usually empty channel began to buzz.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially before the advent of BattleNet, many football enthusiasts were pouring in generous donations.
 </p>
 <p>
  – I used to love soccer.
 </p>
 <p>
  – But lost interest after BattleNet. Still, the World Cup was fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Remember when we reached the semi-finals in the 2002 World Cup?
 </p>
 <p>
  – When are you old folks talking about? LOL
 </p>
 <p>
  [Kim Cheongyong donated 100GP.]
 </p>
 <p>
  – Remembering the good old soccer days~ I wanted to be a soccer player after watching the ’02 World Cup… Here’s a small donation for you, Masied!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you, Kim Cheongyong. The 2002 World Cup is especially memorable for our country.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Masied actively communicated in Korean with every donation,
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren pointed at him, asking,
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s he doing?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I think he’s thanking for the donations. He’s been doing that for a while.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha! How much is he even getting?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even for 100GP.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “100… Ridiculous.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren chuckled and no longer showed interest in Masied.
 </p>
 <p>
  Belittling someone so thankful for a 100GP donation.
 </p>
 <p>
  He deemed him not worth his time.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re late. Sorry about that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “My apologies~ Hehe.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Just then, Seong Jihan and Yoon Seah, who had been in the bot lane, approached.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re really late. What were you up to?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “While raiding the enemy base, I also leveled up my niece a bit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What level are you now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  At Sophia’s intrigued question, Yoon Seah made a ‘V’ sign with her fingers.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Level 15.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…15!? Weren’t you at 6 just a while ago?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren was shocked.
 </p>
 <p>
  How did she level up by 9, even if this was a silver map?
 </p>
 <p>
  He couldn’t fathom how many minions Seong Jihan had led her to.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Everyone’s working hard to level up, but having a good uncle sure helps. Enjoying the carry?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Barren himself was benefiting from a double experience effect, he taunted Yoon Seah.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. It’s amazing. I love being carried!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yoon Seah replied with a bright smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Ugh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stop bickering and get ready.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, noticing Barren’s loss for words, headed toward the violet puddle at the bottom of the valley where Count Naseed was hiding.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How are you thinking of summoning Count Naseed?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Like this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan took out fragments of the ‘Archangel’s Sword’ and ‘Reaper’s Scythe’ from his inventory and threw them into the puddle.
 </p>
 <p>
  Splash!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Archangel’s Sword, which emitted a white glow, and the Reaper’s Scythe fragment engulfed in crimson flames, lost their light as soon as they hit the violet puddle.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, soon after,
 </p>
 <p>
  Kaaaaa!
 </p>
 <p>
  A loud cry echoed from the depths of the puddle.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  A massive mouth lunged out and swallowed the two fragments whole.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Since light and darkness have declined…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Slowly, from the center of the lake, a creature emerged.
 </p>
 <p>
  A massive snake with translucent purple scales, four huge horns, and seven red eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The time for ascension has arrived!]
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the boss monster of the Valley of the End, Count Naseed.
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  “Wow. It really appeared…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Count Naseed, exuding an overwhelming presence from the puddle, stretched all the way to the cliff.
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon its appearance, the sky turned purple.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the surface of the cliffs surrounding the lake, eerie symbols began to be engraved.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That’s it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan looked at those symbols, his eyes shining.
 </p>
 <p>
  The symbol of Count Naseed being engraved on the cliff.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was precisely why a team was needed in the Count Naseed raid.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘While the symbol is active, Count Naseed’s defense and regeneration abilities are significantly enhanced.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Some team members attack the symbol to prevent the enhancement effect on Count Naseed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The remaining team members fight Count Naseed.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was the basic strategy against Count Naseed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hence, a standardized approach was formed where two members would block the symbols and three would fight Count Naseed, termed the ‘2:3 strategy’.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright. We’ll proceed with the pre-discussed strategy.” Seong Jihan, holding a sword and arrow, said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you really going with the strategy you mentioned earlier…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia asked in a worried tone.
 </p>
 <p>
  And rightly so.
 </p>
 <p>
  The strategy Seong Jihan mentioned before the game was not the 2:3 strategy but:
 </p>
 <p>
  “How are you going to handle that all by yourself?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Four attacked the cliff’s symbol, and he alone fought Count Naseed, a rather extreme method.
 </p>
 <p>
  It might have seemed possible because Seong Jihan, who initially defeated a Diamon Rank, was exceptionally strong.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But it looks so formidable…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The sight of the actual Count Naseed was quite daunting.
 </p>
 <p>
  How could anyone handle such a monster alone?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why? He said he could do it. Let’s see it then!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren smirked, crossing his arms.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although he joined the party to tackle Count Naseed.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I won’t cooperate until he asks for help.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren, having an emotional rift, secretly hoped Seong Jihan would fail and ask for his help.
 </p>
 <p>
  For that, he should taste the bitterness of failure once…
 </p>
 <p>
  The party members quickly sensed his thoughts.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Ugh… Petty… So petty.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia thought to herself, but she didn’t utter it out loud.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Typical Barren. Always narrow-minded. Owner, just ask. I’ll help anytime.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Masied openly criticized Barren.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since receiving Arachne Orb and harnessing the God of Soccer’s power, he had unconditional trust in Seong Jihan.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s okay. Just focus on attacking the symbol. I’ll handle the rest.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Okay. I’ll bestow blessings upon you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sighing in relief at Seong Jihan’s words, Sophia bestowed various buffs.
 </p>
 <p>
  Feeling her blessings, he felt instantly lighter.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Trinity. Its effect is indeed profound.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Support Sophia’s Gift was ‘Trinity’.
 </p>
 <p>
  This SS-grade gift had a simple effect.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the name Trinity implies, buffs can be stacked up to three times.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘With this gift, Sophia became the world’s strongest Support.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Though it’s only SS-grade, the efficiency of her blessings was exceptional, making her rank 3rd in the world during the Last 10 Nations era.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you. This should suffice.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re welcome. If you need healing, let me know anytime!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thanks for the thought, but that won’t be necessary.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swooosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan confidently held the shadow sword Eclipse in his left hand and Phoenix’s Arrow in his right, flashing a confident smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I won’t get hit even once.”
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  The hunt for Count Naseed went smoothly.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Mortal! Do not resist!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Initially, the confident Count Naseed shouted,
 </p>
 <p>
  [This rat-like creature…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You dodge well!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ahhh! Kaaaah!!]
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan predicted,
 </p>
 <p>
  The Count couldn’t land a single blow, only displaying his furious outbursts.
 </p>
 <p>
  During the 5-minute battle,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  The purple semi-transparent scales were cracked all over,
 </p>
 <p>
  And out of the seven eyes, three had lost their red glow.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wow… Such graceful movements…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Messing with Count Naseed, LOL.
 </p>
 <p>
  – The skill difference is real…
 </p>
 <p>
  Even after 5 minutes of intense combat, Seong Jihan looked unfazed.
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9473-1">

 <p>
  Most of the attacks were easily dodged,
 </p>
 <p>
  And the unavoidable blows were slowed down by force and blocked.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan continued to showcase his best moves,
 </p>
 <p>
  As if watching a well-orchestrated dance.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Mr. Seong! Come to Japan The goddess awaits you~(laugh)
 </p>
 <p>
  – You have great synergy with AF. Mr. Seong, the US always welcomes you
 </p>
 <p>
  Foreign viewers who came to watch Count Naseed’s hunt were amazed by Seong Jihan’s solo show and flooded the chat asking him to come to their countries.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Ah, foreign comments are flooding the channel ㅡㅡ
 </p>
 <p>
  – It’s become global.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Even if they flood the chat, Seong Jihan won’t see, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Luckily, donations start at 10 million won, LOL.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Shh! Don’t bring the attention of the likes of Gates…
 </p>
 <p>
  Korean viewers were annoyed by the automatically translated foreign comments,
 </p>
 <p>
  But they seemed less sensitive than before, probably thinking Seong Jihan would have already left if he wanted to.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Count Naseed seems to endure well, even though he’s hit accurately.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Is the damage lacking?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Normally, three players deal damage to the boss. It’s tough to do it alone.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Yeah, in general, mages or archers deal more damage than warriors.
 </p>
 <p>
  The battle seemed one-sided,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Kaaaah!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Count Naseed spat out huge thorns from his scales and spewed fire from his mouth,
 </p>
 <p>
  But Seong Jihan used those thorns as stepping stones to approach the Count.
 </p>
 <p>
  In an instant, his shadow sword Eclipse enlarged.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a swish,
 </p>
 <p>
  Another crack appeared on the giant snake’s scales.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sigh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching from a distance, Barren clicked his tongue,
 </p>
 <p>
  That guy is too good.
 </p>
 <p>
  How can a human be like that against such a monster?
 </p>
 <p>
  He should at least get hit once!
 </p>
 <p>
  “The damage is lacking.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really? It seems he’ll defeat it soon. Usually, a first-time Count Naseed hunt takes more than 10 minutes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, it’s lacking.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ignoring Sophia’s comment, Barren thought,
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed, he knew that the damage might not be that lacking.
 </p>
 <p>
  During this battle, Seong Jihan did not use his special skills,
 </p>
 <p>
  Only damaged the scales with his sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  But,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If he defeats Count Naseed alone, I’ll be just a sidekick.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In front of countless viewers from all over the world,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan would be the shining protagonist,
 </p>
 <p>
  And Barren would be reduced to ‘Seong Jihan’s party member 1’.
 </p>
 <p>
  What’s the point of joining the raid party then?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Alright… I’ll land the final blow!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Currently, among the symbols engraved on the cliffs of the four directions,
 </p>
 <p>
  South was Masied, the closest West was handled by Yoon Seah and Sophia,
 </p>
 <p>
  And the symbols on the farthest cliffs, East and North, were covered by Barren.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I attack the symbols on the East and North lightly, I can prevent their activation.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren tried to manage both cliffs while also dealing damage to Count Naseed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sophia, buff me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why? You’re strong enough.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m tired of weak attacks. I need to use a powerful Fire Wave.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well… If you say so.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Sophia layered the buffs, Barren smirked.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s it!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Fire Wave!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The cliffs to the East and North were engulfed in flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the massive wave of fire didn’t stop there,
 </p>
 <p>
  It moved towards Count Naseed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Barren, what are you doing?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The damage is not enough! We need to end this quickly!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren confidently responded to Sophia,
 </p>
 <p>
  He couldn’t hide his smile, thinking of landing the final blow.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sigh… Can’t even endure 5 minutes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching the Fire Wave, Seong Jihan clicked his tongue as if disappointed.
 </p>

  Chapter 99

  <strong>
   Chapter 99
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  5 minutes ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Seong Jihan faced off against Count Naseed, he thought,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This… is easier than I expected?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps it was due to the enhancement bonus from the canyon map and the buff from Sophia’s Trinity.
 </p>
 <p>
  From the moment he confronted Count Naseed, Seong Jihan realized one thing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ah, this.
 </p>
 <p>
  I can win this easily.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I didn’t need to gather party members after all.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Using the Nameless Divine Arts, he could subdue the opponent right now.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the reason Seong Jihan prolonged the battle for 5 minutes was due to the Shadow Sword stat.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The power of Count Naseed’s darkness is tremendous. How about cutting a bit more?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Ariel, in the sword Eclipse form, suggested to Seong Jihan with a brighter voice than usual.
 </p>
 <p>
  And even before she finished speaking,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Shadow Sword stat increases by 1.]
 </p>
 <p>
  His stats went up immediately.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Nice, huh?’
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s worth stalling like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you cut the snake’s scale, you can absorb even more shadow power.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Following Ariel’s suggestion, Seong Jihan began to cut off all of Count Naseed’s scales.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the past 5 minutes, over 70% of the giant snake’s scales were cut.
 </p>
 <p>
  [In your words… it’s amazing.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Shadow Sword stat increased by a whopping 4.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since entering this game, his stat had risen by 5 in total.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the Shadow Sword’s power becoming stronger, Seong Jihan could control the size of the sword even more freely.
 </p>
 <p>
  [It seems we’ve absorbed most of it now.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really? Time to finish him then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Just when Seong Jihan, who had acquired 5 Shadow Sword points, was about to happily strike down Count Naseed,
 </p>
 <p>
  A huge wall of flames suddenly appeared in the valley to the east and north.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Over there. It’s the area Barren is responsible for.’
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no need to keep things in check like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  Why ignite such a blaze?
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan had a hunch about what he was up to.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘In my previous life, he hated it when someone stole his spotlight.’
 </p>
 <p>
  But back then, he held the firm position of the world’s No. 1, the guild master of the America First Guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was more laid-back than he is now.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Barren of that time would have at least waited 10 minutes.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the current him was incredibly impatient.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whooosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching the Fire Wave heading towards Count Naseed, Seong Jihan clicked his tongue.
 </p>
 <p>
  Tsk!
 </p>
 <p>
  Does he really think that will finish him off?
 </p>
 <p>
  Even concentrating mana to pierce a single point would be insufficient, yet he’s deploying such wide-area magic.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although it seemed unlikely that a Fire Wave would deliver the final blow,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can’t let this slide.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Starting petty fights like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  That…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to set him straight.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud! Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan quickly distanced himself from Count Naseed, he flew towards the western cliffside where his party members were.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What…what’s this? Why are you here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  As Seong Jihan landed on the cliffside and approached, Barren seemed to flinch, a stark contrast to his previous confidence.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sophia spoke with a tone of disbelief, “If you were going to do that, why did you use my magic…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Regaining his composure, Barren puffed out his chest and replied, “Ahem! Seong Jihan! A warrior should be marking the monster at the frontline. Why did you come here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re not following my instructions, are you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I only came to help because it seemed like the damage wasn’t getting through!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, really? Without a word?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I had to act quickly! If I had been there, we would’ve dealt proper damage!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swooosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  With a faint smile, Seong Jihan spread out his palm. All the party members behind Barren began to levitate, moving backward.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, show me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll just watch from behind. You do it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Saying so, Seong Jihan took position behind Barren, as if guarding the other party members.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll control the symbols. Ariel.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Should I move to the cliffside?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. That fool, balcon, can’t use magic simultaneously in a crisis. Head over and block the symbols from the east and north.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [TL/N: Balcon – means ‘showy but useless’. I forgot to add this note in Chapter 52.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ah, understood.]
 </p>
 <div id="pf-9472-1">
  <script>
   window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1"})
  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  The shadow sword Eclipse sank into the ground and, turning into a long shadow, moved towards the cliffside.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Balcon? Who’re you calling a balcon…?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren flared up at that comment, but Seong Jihan continued, ignoring him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Masied will keep controlling the symbols from the south.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it, Boss.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [TL/N: Seong Jihan’s title as Owner has been changed to Boss for accuracy.]
 </p>
 <p>
  While Masied, who was stationed at the southern cliff, continued his task, Seong Jihan said, “Seah, join Sophia and attack the markings from the west.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay. Just do as usual?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah… Sorry, Jihan. For not stopping him.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What for? He can handle it, can’t he? I’ll guard both of you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren was rendered speechless.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright. Positions are set.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Having rearranged the party, Seong Jihan gave Barren a sly smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do it your way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  [Translator – Kshn]
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  – Wow, he’s merciless. Giving him a lesson?
 </p>
 <p>
  – But what if Barren captures it?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Don’t worry about that.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Isn’t it a problem if he dies? How will he capture it then?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Jihan will have a plan. Why worry so much?
 </p>
 <p>
  – I’m worried the Count Naseed Raid might fail.
 </p>
 <p>
  – We apologize for Barren’s behavior.
 </p>
 <p>
  – LOL at the symbol next to the ID.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Such an American move. LOL.
 </p>
 <p>
  Between those praising the strict lesson and those worried about a raid failure, and even an apologetic American, the chat scroll was a chaotic whirlwind.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Damn it…! Once the symbols are controlled, does he think nobody else can handle it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren, on the other hand, felt this might be an opportunity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing Seong Jihan taking on Count Naseed, it seemed not as formidable as expected!
 </p>
 <p>
  If he could defeat it himself here, he could turn the current situation around by 180 degrees.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I have the Absolute Domain, after all. I can easily block such snake attacks!’
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash! Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  The remaining three eyes of Count Naseed glinted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Fire Wave he used earlier was extinguished the moment it touched Count Naseed. Until he saw that, Barren was confident.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Are you my opponent this time?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The gaze of the enormous snake turned to Barren.
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to when facing Seong Jihan, the monster’s voice seemed somewhat more relaxed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Die.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Count Naseed opened its mouth, and a massive blaze burst out.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ice Shield!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren hastily conjured an ice barrier, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud! Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  The snake’s flames easily melted it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you doing? Not using the Force?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh! Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan, circling the Phoenix’s Arrow behind his back, cheekily gave advice.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your Absolute Domain is vast. Can’t even extinguish that little fire?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shield! Ice Shield!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re so hasty. Not going to attack?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shut up! I can’t concentrate!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why not use the Force? Say, ‘Fire, go away!’ and it will go away, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Eeek!”
 </p>
 <p>
  – Seong Jihan teasing from behind is hilariousㅋㅋㅋㅋ
 </p>
 <p>
  – ㅋㅋㅋBeing nagged like that is super annoying
 </p>
 <p>
  His double-layered protective magic melted away again.
 </p>
 <p>
  The snake’s flames entered Barren’s Absolute Domain.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Right… I can push the flames away with the Force!’
 </p>
 <p>
  He can do it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Why can’t I?
 </p>
 <p>
  Channeling his Force, Barren desperately hoped.
 </p>
 <p>
  For the trajectory of the flames to shift!
 </p>
 <p>
  With strong willpower, shouldn’t he be able to control the Force?
 </p>
 <p>
  However, that was just wishful thinking.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Why… why isn’t it working…!’
 </p>
 <p>
  The flames didn’t waver.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead, they gradually shattered the Absolute Territory, reaching right before Barren’s eyes. It felt like he would be devoured by the flames in moments.
 </p>
 <p>
  His heart sank.
 </p>
 <p>
  Tsk…!
 </p>
 <p>
  So far, having the powerful defensive means of the Absolute Domain meant he rarely faced dire situations.

 <p>
  Now, facing this threat, his ability to react was severely lacking.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan’s description of him as a “greenhorn” fit Barren perfectly.
 </p>
 <p>
  He tried to repel the flames with the Force, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t the flames that got pushed away, but himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah! Oh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren, hurling himself into the flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before melting away, he looked back with a dazed expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  As if he had expected this, Seong Jihan calmly looked at Barren.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Surely…No way…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm? You should know whose mistake it was.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan shrugged his shoulders.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t blame this on me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Barren couldn’t refute his words.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because indeed, it was his mistake.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This… is… the end…”
 </p>
 <p>
  His body was soon engulfed by the flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  For someone who began confidently trying to deliver the final blow, it was an utterly pitiable end.
 </p>
 <p>
  * * * * *
 </p>
 <p>
  – What was that? ㅋㅋㅋㅋ He just got blasted off by himself ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
 </p>
 <p>
  – This is totally embarrassing ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ. Did Seong Jihan push him with force?
 </p>
 <p>
  – From what he said, it doesn’t seem so. Seems like he just lost control ㅋㅋㅋ.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Oh my God… Why do I have to feel this secondhand embarrassment…
 </p>
 <p>
  – I even bought Barren’s jersey as an AF fan…
 </p>
 <p>
  – Dear God! I guess we don’t need to scout Barren anymore, wwww.
 </p>
 <p>
  With Barren self-destructing, the chat was filled with mocking messages.
 </p>
 <p>
  – So, how do we defeat it now? Are we going to fail in the Count Naseed Raid? ㅠㅠ
 </p>
 <p>
  – What a pity… Just close your eyes and ignore it.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Exactly. Seong Jihan couldn’t deal damage, and yet… His attitude is so nasty! Why is he like this only to Barren?!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Are the Barren fans here? Why are there so many usernames with an angry tone ㅋㅋㅋ?
 </p>
 <p>
  – Seong Jihan has his plans; that’s why he’s like that~!
 </p>
 <p>
  – Oh come on~~ Just trust him and see~!
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though Seong Jihan continuously attacked for 5 minutes, he couldn’t finish off Count Naseed.
 </p>
 <p>
  People were worried if they could cover up the vacancy left by Barren.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  Seong Jihan confidently moved forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Thunderbolt Dash.’
 </p>
 <p>
  His body shot towards Count Naseed like an arrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You too- will… die-!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike when he was dealing with Barren, Count Naseed’s voice quivered a bit. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels
 </p>
 <p>
  To block Seong Jihan’s approach, he fired massive spikes from his scales and spat out flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  But Seong Jihan, just like before, used the spikes as a stepping stone and jumped over Count Naseed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ariel. Come.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes, master.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Retrieving the Shadow Sword from the opposite side, Seong Jihan unleashed his full power.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nameless Divine Arts, Dark Shadow Technique – Ascension of Black Shadow
 </p>
 <p>
  The blade of the Shadow Sword split in two.
 </p>
 <p>
  Simultaneously, the lake that the massive snake inhabited turned black.
 </p>
 <p>
  This wasn’t just a mere color change; the very nature of the substance transformed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The lake, which held thousands of tons of water, suddenly disappeared, and a dark shadow took its place.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ugh- Ughhh-!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Fear mixed in Count Naseed’s voice, which had previously shown no reaction even when he was continuously slashed.
 </p>
 <p>
  He desperately tried to wriggle out of the shadow’s domain, but it was already too late.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shwoooosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The shadow began to rise, absorbing the sunlight in the battlefield and ascending to the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ah-]
 </p>
 <p>
  The snake couldn’t finish its sentence and was completely consumed by the darkness.
 </p>
 <p>
  The dark shadow extended even higher, soaring up like a pillar into the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ascension of Black Shadow.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite being a shadow, its power to absorb light defied the world’s logic and contradicted the laws of nature.
 </p>
 <p>
  Left alone, it seemed as if it would climb beyond the clouds.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…With my current strength, this must be the limit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swishhh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The pillar of shadow disappeared in the blink of an eye, as if it had never existed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ultimate technique of the Dark Shadow Technique, the Ascension of Black Shadow, which erases the opponent entirely from the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  As this technique was even more potent than the Dark Soul Vortex, it was actually a bit too much for the current Seong Jihan to execute.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it weren’t for the enhancements from the Demon Faction and Sophia’s blessings, he wouldn’t have considered using it.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  “The effect remains the same.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In the place where the shadow had vanished,
 </p>
 <p>
  Everything, including Count Naseed, was cleanly obliterated.
 </p>
 <p>
  The water from the lake had evaporated completely, leaving a dry crater.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not a single scale of Count Naseed remained.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have successfully subdued Count Naseed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Immediately, the reward for subduing him was given to Seong Jihan.

 <p>
  The next day.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was curious about how Jenna would react to Aaron’s disappearance, but she didn’t say a word. She just nodded to me.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Aaron told me the other day, that he might not be able to come back for a while.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna didn’t ask for more details.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though she asked, if I could convey a message, she asked me to tell him that ‘she’s cheering for him, waiting for his return.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I contacted Yurnet.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;That should be simple enough.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  And time passed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Training room on the 13th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iron clashed, and sparks flew.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s unrecognizable.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridigion said in a low voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, my sword moved.
 </p>
 <p>
  When we first fought, I couldn’t even cut a piece of Ridigion’s clothes.
 </p>
 <p>
  But now,
 </p>
 <p>
  Thump!
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridigion’s body, which blocked my attack, was pushed back.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was only a step though, but my swordsmanship was clearly delivering effective blows. I immediately retracted my sword and continued the attack. Thud. The muscles throughout my body responded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “At this rate, I might die.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Stop exaggerating.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I laughed and turned around, raising my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ohm! The blade that tore through the wind forcefully struck Ridigion’s side. Ridigion tried to deflect it with his sword, but he couldn’t stop his body from being pushed back. The cracked floor under Ridigion’s feet shattered, and pieces of stone flew.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridigion, who had been pushed back, regained his stance.
 </p>
 <p>
  I straightened my sword and asked, “Is this enough to pass?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems like Master has achieved his goal.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I caught my breath.
 </p>
 <p>
  My entire body was trembling. Every time I swung my sword, my body moved as if in response. It was a sensation I had never felt before.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Remember that feeling well. It will be of great help to Master.”

  I nodded and murmured.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Status window.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The familiar hologram appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Han Israt (★★★) Lv. 20 (Exp 13/160)]

 <p>
  The level hadn’t changed. Still level 20.
 </p>
 <p>
  Stats hadn’t changed either. But there was a significant change in other aspects.
 </p>
 <p>
  My weapon skill had risen from Low-level Swordsmanship (Lv.8) to Intermediate Swordsmanship (Lv.1), and I had completed the skill separation with the help of the Awakening Elixir. Although I had lost proficiency with shields, my understanding of swordsmanship had deepened. That wasn’t all.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Warrior.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I had completed the job change.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clearly, the class name “Warrior” which was written below the name field, qualified me to evolve first-tier skills. I lost the skill of Stealth due to the class penalty, but it didn’t matter since it didn’t suit me anyway.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Pain Resistance, Composure, Frenzy, Invincible.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Other useful passive skills had also increased by one level each.
 </p>
 <p>
  All of this was the result of 20 days of continuous training. After bidding farewell to Aaron, I devoted myself to training and sparring from morning to night. Ridigion didn’t spare any effort in advising and teaching me, even giving up his own training.
 </p>
 <p>
  And so, I achieved my goal much faster than expected.

 <p>
  ‘The difference between having an instructor and not is tremendous.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I keenly felt it.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how talented you are, there are limits to self-study. Even if you are a genius without limits, having an instructor is several times better. Especially if the quality of that instructor is exceptional.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is today the end?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Thank you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The ultimate goal, Divine Sword Spirit, had been achieved last night.
 </p>
 <p>
  Today, I had come to test the results of that achievement for a moment. Ridigion sheathed his sword and sighed regretfully.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master will be leaving soon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “About four days left, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a shame. If Master could stay for a month, no, six months…”

 <p>
  “If I stayed that long, I’d rot, Ridigion.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Training is not bad, but practical experience is even more important.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed that being stuck in one place and swinging the sword all day had gradually dulled my sense of real combat. And even if I want I can’t participate in missions while I’m at Niflheimr.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What happened to Jenna?”
 </p>
 <p>
  After parting ways with Ridigion, I asked.
 </p>
 <p>
  The space beside me blurred, and a person appeared. It was Nisled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “She’s currently dedicated to training in the Special Wing on the second floor.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “And the results?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “After advancing to the Thief job, she easily achieved Intermediate Archery. Now, she’s working on mixing Speed Fire and Identifying Weaknesses. According to the report, she seems to be on the verge of success. She’s quite a talented individual.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “As expected, huh?”
 </p>

 <p>
  I chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna, purely in terms of talent, was superior to me. I was only advancing slightly ahead using my knowledge of the game. Given the right circumstances, she could explosively grow at any time.
 </p>
 <p>
  After completing half of her training, I immediately excluded Jenna from group training.
 </p>
 <p>
  Initially, she was not on the same level as the recruits. It wasn’t just about talent or skill; her battlefield experience was incomparable. She had gone through hellish situations in every mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It was a 37-game winning streak, right?’
 </p>
 <p>
  37 battles, 37 victories, 0 losses.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the combat data Jenna had with the recruits.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Even if I hadn’t asked them to, she would have received separate training.’
 </p>
 <p>
  And she would have been forcibly recruited by Niflheimr.
 </p>
 <p>
  Currently, the hero guiding Jenna one-on-one is Nigel Lexna, ranked 13th.

  He was the archer with the highest rank after Nihaku. It would have been better if Nihaku himself could guide her, but I couldn’t force him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “When she succeeds in the skills synthesis, move on to the next task. Teach her about traps.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Nisled bowed and disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were about four days left. I heard that he was also dedicating himself to training day and night. That should be sufficient. I headed to the garden on the left side.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I arrived in the center of the garden, Yurnet was sipping tea. Yurnet lowered her gaze when she saw me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why are you in such trouble?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master is leaving soon…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not like we’ll never see each other again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet stood up from her seat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll make a stop before returning to Earth.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I didn’t mean that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet puffed out her cheeks.
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled and sat down in a chair.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, is it complete?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you’re talking about the item you mentioned, the work is done.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet said and then retrieved a small box from her pocket.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was small enough to fit in the palm of my hand. When I opened the box, a ring with a black gemstone inside emitted a dark light. Yurnet took the ring out.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Here, take it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I received the ring.

  A black-patterned ring with no embellishments.

 <p>
  As I held it in one hand, a message appeared in my mind.

 <p>
  I received the ring.
 </p>
 <p>
  A black-patterned ring with no embellishments.

 <p>
  As I held it in one hand, a message appeared in my mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Proof of Transcendence]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Grade: SS]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Legendary!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “A ring made by special processing Niflheimr’s Star Iron. It contains a power that transcends the laws. However, to utilize it, higher-level magic is required.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Note – Special bound item. Ownership cannot be transferred. Indestructible.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet explained, “It’s a token of mastery. Even if you happen to meet other members, there shouldn’t be any confusion. And there’s more…”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;As long as you wear the ring, you can communicate with me no matter how far apart we are.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet’s voice echoed in my mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  It even had remote communication capabilities.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There was no need to include such features.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled bitterly.
 </p>
 <p>
  What I wanted was simple: to hide the Master’s attention.
 </p>
 <p>
  Until now, I had refrained from actions that would take me away from being just a hero because of Anytng’s gaze.
 </p>
 <p>
  The biggest limitation was not being able to create items or enchant them. That’s why I was still using the “Well Forged Iron Sword” that I had made in the beginning, even though I had plenty of materials to enhance it.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I consulted Yurnet about it, she said there was a way and asked me to wait a bit.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was possible to deceive the Master’s interface, she said.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘She mentioned something about the interference gap, right?’
 </p>

 <p>
  I didn’t know the exact principle, but if it was possible, that would be great.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the warehouse, various rare items that I hadn’t touched were sleeping. While there were still limitations, my range of actions had widened compared to before.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You said I could inquire with the fairy, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. This ring is enchanted with advanced information manipulation. Like this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Yurnet murmured, the ring emitted a dark light.
 </p>
 <p>
  The item window was updated.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ring of Shadows]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Grade: C-]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Magic!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Made from low-quality black steel.]

 <p>
  [Note – Enchanted with ‘Durability Enhancement’ magic.]
 </p>
 <p>
  From SS grade to C- grade.
 </p>
 <p>
  The item’s information changed in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How long can I use it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It will lose its effect if Townia’s Master goes beyond the 50th floor.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If it was due to the interference gap, it was natural for the effectiveness to decrease as the floor increased.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, up to the 50th floor should provide plenty of leeway. Even if there were limitations, it wouldn’t be entirely unusable.
 </p>
 <p>
  I put the ring on my left index finger.
 </p>
 <p>
  It fits perfectly.

  “Thank you. Making this on my own would have been difficult.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s nothing compared to Master’s efforts.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet smiled.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet Seed was Niflheimr’s strongest magician and at the same time, the top magician. Her skills were enough to be counted on one hand even if you searched the entire server. Among the hundreds of equipment I had created, only a few hadn’t been touched by her. So now…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The last one is left.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I had achieved my training goals.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had sent Aaron to Myuden, and Jenna was also getting stronger in her own way.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had obtained an item that could deceive the Master’s attention. I had accomplished most of the goals I had set. But one remained.
 </p>
 <p>
  I recalled the battle on the 20th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  The dragon’s claw tore through the shield like a piece of paper, and the longsword couldn’t withstand the battle and broke.

 <p>
  If my party members hadn’t lent me their weapons, I would have fought barehanded and died.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I need a weapon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Not just any ordinary weapon.
 </p>
 <p>
  One that could withstand the monstrous power of the monsters.
 </p>
 <p>
  One that was sturdy and unbreakable in any situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yurnet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’d like to borrow a weapon from Niflheimr.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet smiled and said, “I’ll open the door to the armory.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Yurnet gestured, mist gathered in the air.
 </p>

 <p>
  The mist swirled and created a dimensional portal in a corner of the garden.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I got up from the chair and the tea and snacks on the table scattered into the mist.
 </p>
 <p>
  Following Yurnet’s guidance, I stepped through the dimensional portal.
 </p>
 <p>
  My vision darkened.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Yurnet snapped her fingers, light spread out, illuminating the room.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Arsenal Lv.Max]
 </p>
 <p>
  A vast space spanning hundreds of meters.
 </p>
 <p>
  Various items were densely packed on display shelves.
 </p>
 <p>
  From basic weapons like swords, spears, and axes to unique weapons like sickle blades and giant swords. On one wall, there were huge weapons like cannons and ballistae for sieges. I picked up a sword placed on the display shelf.

  [High-Grade Steel Sword]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Grade: B+]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Excellent!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Crafted from high-grade steel using special techniques. Lightweight, sharp, and durable, it doesn’t easily break under various impacts.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Note – Brand: Niflheimr]
 </p>
 <p>
  A Niflheimr steel sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  I hadn’t personally crafted it, but it was made with extremely high quality.
 </p>
 <p>
  I raised the sword. My face was reflected on its transparent blade.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master, such low-grade weapons do not befit your dignity. Come this way. There’s a place with even more special weapons.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I lowered the sword.

 <p>
  Taking this would be enough for now. But what I wanted was a weapon that I could use until I finished climbing the entire tower. This wouldn’t suffice.
 </p>
 <p>
  I followed Yurnet.
 </p>
 <p>
  The corridor narrowed. At the end of the path, I could see a circular, massive door.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The entrance to the second armory.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Made of solid steel and impervious to dozens of bombardments.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I will open the door.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet placed her hand on the door.
 </p>
 <p>
  A blue magic circle spread from her fingertip and covered the door.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Everything in here…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They’re all likely S grade or higher.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Master, the true treasures of Niflheimr, created by Master himself, are on display here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Impressive.
 </p>
 <p>
  The door began to slide open sideways.

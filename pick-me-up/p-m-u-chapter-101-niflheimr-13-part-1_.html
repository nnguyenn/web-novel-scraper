 <p>
  I opened my eyes narrowly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The facility wasn’t spacious.

 <p>
  At best, it was about the size of a small playground.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shelves were placed between the walls made of black marble.
 </p>
 <p>
  I stepped inside and asked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “132, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. A total of 132. Items born from the Master’s fingertips.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Calling it my fingertips doesn’t feel right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I took out a weapon from the front shelf.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang.
 </p>
 <p>
  I held a longsword in my hand. A gray light emitted from the sheath covered my sight. Like branches, there were patterns on the ashy blade.
 </p>
 <p>
  I muttered softly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Item Appraisal.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [Mysteltein]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Grade: S]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Immortal!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [A sword made from the cursed world tree branch and black iron, specially processed. It can ignore all the blessings the opponent possesses and inflict damage. However, physical and magical defenses are not ignored.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Attribute: Fixed Damage (A)]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Note – Special Bound Item, Indestructible]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Note2 – Niflheimr Collection (No.065)]

 <p>
  “It’s been a while.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I swung the sword with one hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  A cold sensation traveled from my wrist to my shoulder.
 </p>
 <p>
  I recalled the battle with the Black Dragon.
 </p>
 <p>
  The biggest challenge in that battle was the immunity to physical and magic. But if I had this weapon back then, things might have been different. Mysteltein had the effect of ignoring special defenses like immunity and reflection.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Fixed damage is convenient.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It didn’t have any other special functions, but just the fixed damage was enough reason to keep it.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you want to take Mysteltein?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No.”

 </div>
 <p>
  I put Mysteltein back on the shelf.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Its effectiveness is limited.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Mysteltein was effective against enemies using special defenses, but it wasn’t that powerful in normal circumstances. It was better to have more versatile options.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the next shelf.
 </p>
 <p>
  The entrance to the shelf, protected by five layers of devices, opened. Inside was a translucent blue sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Varisada]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Grade: S+]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Immortal!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Made from the horns and scales of the Shadow Demon King. It can deliver a powerful strike that ignores the opponent’s physical defense and related skills.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Attribute: Physical Penetration (S)]

 <p>
  [Note2 – Niflheimr Collection (No.113)]
 </p>
 <p>
  I reached for the hilt.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sheath became blurry, allowing my hand to pass through.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Physical Penetration.’
 </p>
 <p>
  This sword couldn’t be stopped by the physical defense of its enemy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Varisada’s blade, made by defeating the Shadow Demon King, who could hide in the Shadow Dimension, could cut through the opponent’s armor or scales, slicing through their insides. In front of this sword, even the toughest enemies turn into scarecrows.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It doesn’t work against magical defenses.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I withdrew my hand from the shelf.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clank.
 </p>

 <p>
  The protective device was reactivated, and the door closed.
 </p>
 <p>
  I moved to the next shelf.
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, it was a spear, not a sword. Its name was Guinir. It was a sub-category of the Brunnak and an early model. However, it had its advantages and could crush dozens of distant enemies in a single blow.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How about Guinir? I think it would be a great help in large-scale battles.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that your recommendation?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Since it’s activation-based, you don’t need to know how to use a spear.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet, who had been leading the way, turned back.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master, you are welcome to take all the weapons here. After all, you are the one who made them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I didn’t make them alone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I shook my head.
 </p>

 <p>
  The equipment in the second weapons store was all manually crafted. That is, they were made using mini-games from ‘Pick Me Up,’ just like the sword and shield I had. However, I couldn’t have done it alone.
 </p>
 <p>
  Without the various personnel assisting in item creation, I could only make items up to B grade at best. Especially without Yurnet, I wouldn’t have even dreamt of items above S grade.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Besides, most weapons have their owners, don’t they? I shouldn’t take them without permission.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “More importantly, I’m not really interested in any of these.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I listed the items in my mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  A total of 132. They were not items made haphazardly but crafted as needed at the right time, driven by necessity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mostly the need is:
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Maximize the owner’s strengths and eliminate weaknesses.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Out of the 132 weapons, 101 had designated owners.
 </p>

 <p>
  Usually, they are carefully stored, but when it’s time for an exhibition, they will be in their hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  Furthermore, these weapons are custom-made by analyzing the owner’s combat style.
 </p>
 <p>
  For heroes who show weaknesses in large-scale battles, items that increase firepower are provided. If the weakness is in long-term battles, their stamina is reinforced. If they are vulnerable to specific attributes, that is addressed too. The members of the main party were no exception.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have asked you to come for nothing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled bitterly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Indeed, it seems there are no weapons here that I can use.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if I check the specs of all the collections, there are no weapons suitable for me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if there were, the performance of the weapon itself would hinder my growth. I closed my eyes and thought again.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A sharp, sturdy, unbreakable weapon.’

 <p>
  I shook my head.
 </p>
 <p>
  This isn’t enough. If I settle for this, there’s no need to take weapons from Niflheimr. I can make them in Townia.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…If I want more than that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I reached a conclusion.
 </p>
 <p>
  I opened my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yurnet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I need to make a weapon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “As you command.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet extended her hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mist gathered, and a dimensional portal was drawn.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was thinking along the same lines. The treasures here are undoubtedly powerful, but they don’t befit your majesty.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I smirked.
 </p>
 <p>
  As I stepped into the portal, mist enveloped my entire body.
 </p>
 <p>
  I walked out into a new place, and a system message appeared, indicating the current location.

  [Primordial Forge Lv.Max]
 </p>
 <p>
  The lava is boiling.

 <p>
  Bubbles burst, releasing heat.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet extended her hand, and a transparent aura surrounded me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master, please be careful. The temperature is high.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked ahead.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lava gathered to form a small lake. The Primordial Forge. It was a special facility that could be obtained by reaching the highest level of the Equipment Forge and satisfying a few secret conditions. Its effect was simple.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It can create special items.”
 </p>
 <p>
  However, there were several penalties.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s get ready.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet put a black coat on me.
 </p>
 <p>
  The hot air seemed to subside. It seemed to have a temperature-reducing effect.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Prove your mastery.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet’s voice echoed widely throughout the cave.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sizzle. I looked at my left hand. Black lightning was emanating from the ring on my index finger.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Syncing Niflheimr Master Authorization.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet’s eyes shone blue and then dimmed.
 </p>
 <p>
  And.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Equipment forging begins!]

 <p>
  A hologram window appeared at the top of my field of vision.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was familiar with it, having seen it hundreds of times. It was the crafting window from ‘Pick Me Up.’
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Master, what type of weapon would you like to create?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “A growth-type weapon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I had been making items for heroes whose growth was almost complete.
 </p>
 <p>
  But now, I was far from bearing fruit. I needed to change my approach. I adjusted the details.
 </p>
 <p>
  Type, Special.
 </p>
 <p>
  Form, Longsword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Method, Casting.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Did you choose Casting? Are you sure? A penalty will be applied.&gt;

 <p>
  I started sorting them by category. Ores went with ores, leather with leather. After finishing the classification, I recited the items to be used.
 </p>
 <p>
  “9 Niflheimr Steel, 5 Mithril, 3 Black Iron, 2 Oriharukon, 1 Nebula, 5 Hell’s Crystals…”
 </p>
 <p>
  A white magic circle appeared on the right side of the forge.
 </p>
 <p>
  Materials began to appear on the magic circle. I envisioned the finished product in my mind while reciting the names of the materials.
 </p>
 <p>
  13 types of ores.
 </p>
 <p>
  10 types of leather.
 </p>
 <p>
  15 types of crystals.
 </p>
 <p>
  9 types of wood.
 </p>
 <p>
  8 miscellaneous items.
 </p>
 <p>
  I decided to use a total of 55 types of materials.

  &lt;Material preparation complete. Initiating summoning order.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  A misty dimensional portal appeared on the left side of the forge.
 </p>
 <p>
  From the dimensional portal emerged an old man with a bushy beard.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why have you summoned me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Master’s command.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “What? The Master is here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The old man’s eyes widened as he looked at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “W-what…!”

 <p>
  &lt;First summon. Gather all craftsmen of rank 1 or higher at the facility.&gt;

  [Equipment Forge Lv.Max!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The condition is perfect. With the right conditions, the best weapon will be created!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Affiliated Facilities – Blacksmithy (Lv.max), Carpentry (Lv.max), Workshop (Lv.max), Enchantment (Lv.max), Alchemy… ]

 <p>
  [Personnel in waiting – 135]
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Phase 1 processing begins. Sending materials.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The material on the magic circle turned into light and scattered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The blueprint?”

 <p>
  &lt;Currently in progress.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked to my side.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet’s robe was fluttering intensely. Numerous magic circles appeared and disappeared in the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;The enchantment formula is self-evolving and adaptive. Analyzing the Master’s combat patterns and transforming them into an appropriate form. Next, synchronizing with the forge and workshop.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The air distorted, revealing a scene.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a blacksmith’s shop with various tools large and small. An old man was wiping sweat in there, and many people were bustling around.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Assembly is complete, but using 13 types of ores won’t be easy, right? Their properties don’t match at all…”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Wait until the instructions come.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The scene in the air became blurry.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet turned to me and said, “Master, are you sure about this? Based on the calculations, the crafting difficulty is higher than expected.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “How much?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems challenging even for Hellish difficulty.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That would be God-like.”
 </p>
 <p>
  That was the difficulty when crafting the Five Sacred Weapons.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It might be even higher.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s find out. Is the enchantment ready?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, let’s go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Crafting was manual.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Primordial Forge didn’t operate automatically. Next was the difficulty selection screen. From the lowest tier below to the top tier of Super Hellish. The crafting puzzle was categorized into eight difficulty levels.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Basically.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I pressed the forge icon on the left.
 </p>
 <p>
  [He who wants to enter hell, offer a sacrifice.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A burning effect appeared in the crafting window.
 </p>
 <p>
  [※Hell]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Primordial Forge, effect activated!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Insert the item. Hidden difficulty levels are unlocked depending on the grade of the sacrifice.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stormbringer, Begalta, Azoth.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Are you putting in three?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”

 <p>
  Three swords floated above the lava lake.
 </p>
 <p>
  They had high grades despite having no owners. Moreover, they were replaceable weapons. The swords melted into the lava.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Three.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I sacrificed three weapons of S rank or higher.
 </p>
 <p>
  When making the Five Sacred Weapons, it was only one. Even when making Levateinn, I only used two.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You offered a worthy sacrifice.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [I will open the true gates of hell.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Enchantment Difficulty – Super God-Like]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Super God-like, huh.”

 <p>
  I clicked my tongue.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had half-expected it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Weapons that changed dynamically had an incredibly high crafting difficulty.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s why I hadn’t attempted growth-type equipment until now. Even in Niflheimr, losing hundreds of top-tier materials at once was a big blow.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Difficulty penalty activated!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Facility’s effect reduced to 1/3.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Success Probability: Impossible – Guaranteed failure. Do not proceed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do you want to proceed?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes/No]
 </p>
 <p>
  “They say not to do it, but I’ve already offered the sacrifice.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet smiled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems there’s no turning back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I shrugged my shoulders.
 </p>
 <p>
  I cleared my mind of distractions one by one. I had casually handled Super Hellish difficulty puzzles, but it was a different story from Super God-Like or higher. A single mistake could lead to failure.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Almost a year.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Time spent solely on puzzles.
 </p>
 <p>
  While everyone else automated their crafting, I became obsessed with manual crafting. I researched the patterns of the puzzles and practiced countless times. All to provide stronger weapons to the heroes.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Hand of Heaven.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Also called the Soundrend Hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Another nickname that someone had given me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Does this puzzle have meaning?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do you want to proceed?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes (selected) / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  I pressed the selection screen.

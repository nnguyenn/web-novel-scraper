 <p>
  My goal here has almost been achieved.
 </p>
 <p>
  First, I was able to obtain various useful information.
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  How the heroes of Niflheimr view me, and the relationship between heroes and masters. Also, an approximate understanding of how to utilize the power I possess.
 </p>
 <p>
  Next was skill acquisition.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here, I could acquire the intermediate combat skill at a much faster rate than training alone.
 </p>
 <p>
  Skill separation wasn’t bad either, but above all, learning the Heavenly Sword Spirit technique was something to celebrate. The Intermediate combat skill might have taken me a longer time to acquire in Townia, but this skill can only be learned here. As an excellent skill, it will be of great help to me in the future.
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally, I obtained new equipment.
 </p>
 <p>
  A ring that can manipulate information and a growth-type weapon.
 </p>
 <p>
  If I use the ring properly, I can significantly expand my operational area, and the growth-type weapon holds tremendous potential. It’s something to look forward to in the future.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s also something about Aaron and Jenna.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron is probably currently fully immersed in training with Myuden. I can’t predict the results. I’ll have to wait to see it unfold.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master, are you in?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I heard a knock.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was Nisled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come in.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I apologize.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Nisled opened the door and entered.
 </p>
 <p>
  As always, Nisled headed towards the bed but stopped in her tracks.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Master.”

 <p>
  The bed was perfectly tidy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not a single wrinkle was visible.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Today’s the last day, isn’t it? I paid attention.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I sheathed my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ve been here exactly one month. Yesterday marked the end of the Niflheimr recruit training program. Today is the day for awarding certificates and the farewell ceremony.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But why am I the top-ranked when I haven’t done anything?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I complained.
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s one problem with the training. It’s that I’m ranked first overall among the recruits in the scores released yesterday. Besides the initial lessons, I hardly went out.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Of course, you are. You’re the best among the 100 candidates.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet’s words echoed in my ears.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Seems unfair.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;It’s also an excuse for giving you items.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “You mean this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I clicked my tongue and tapped Biforst’s hilt with my elbow.
 </p>
 <p>
  Right now, this weapon has become an A-rank magic sword through information manipulation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. It’s a reward for being the top in Niflheimr’s training. Don’t decline it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I smirked.
 </p>
 <p>
  I do need a pretext. When I return, Anytng will surely examine me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What about second place?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jenna Shirai. She’s first in the thief category, and second overall. She’s quite outstanding. Very talented.”
 </p>

  “Don’t bother her. I’m taking her with me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, I’ve informed the head instructor.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That woman’s there too, huh?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The training camp head instructor, Eclet Pardisa.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to Nisled, she visited several times to apologize to me. But I was always either out training or busy, so we never met, and she went back.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took out an envelope from the drawer.
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside was a note. I didn’t have time to meet her now, but I still wrote it to convey my message. The recipient is Eclet. The content is to keep up the good work in the future. There’s nothing special.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Give this to the head instructor.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I handed the envelope to Nisled.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nisled bowed his head to receive it.

 </div>
 <p>
  ‘It’s gonna be over today.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Fog gathered in the corner of the room.
 </p>
 <p>
  A shadow resembling my appearance was created.
 </p>
 <p>
  The illusion would return after conducting the graduation ceremony and then return to the room. After packing, I would leave for Townia straight away.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ve worked hard too, Nisled.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It was an honor to serve.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Honor? Not really.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled and left.
 </p>
 <p>
  The destination is the dimensional portal next to the bed. It’s connected to the 13th floor of Niflheimr. Yurnet made it last night, asking me to drop by, so I stepped inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  The mist obscuring my vision dispersed.
 </p>

 <p>
  I could see the familiar garden landscape I had seen many times.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master, I’ve been waiting.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet got up from her seat.
 </p>
 <p>
  She wasn’t wearing the plain robe as usual. She was wearing Niflheimr’s Conqueror outfit.
 </p>
 <p>
  “For now, come this way. I’ll prepare a meal.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No need to prepare. This will do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I picked up a piece of bread from the basket.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’m not a fan of eating a lot for breakfast. I took a bite of the bread and spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why did you call me? I can’t even attend the graduation ceremony now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s been a while since I’ve seen Jenna face to face.
 </p>

 <p>
  “You’re leaving today, isn’t it natural for me to call you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  There was a slight hint of dissatisfaction in Yurnet’s gaze.
 </p>
 <p>
  The expression of dissatisfaction soon turned into regret.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t even know when you’ll come back…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t answer.
 </p>
 <p>
  I don’t know when I’ll return after leaving either. That was the truth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master, there’s one last thing I want to ask. Are you really going back to Townia? It’s fine for you to stay in Niflheimr. Even with Seris…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m sorry. You’ve already answered that. I apologize for my impertinence.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet lowered her head.
 </p>

 <p>
  I sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I appreciate what you’ve done here. If it weren’t for you, I would have had to go a long way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No. We’re just sorry that we can’t do more.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You guys are… amazing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If I were in your shoes, I would have been extremely annoyed. Bossing you around, putting you in tough battles, handling you as I pleased.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s not the case at all.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s what’s amazing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet and the other three heroes, including Ridgion, have been with me from the early days of Niflheimr.
 </p>
 <p>
  During this period, I’ve given them harsh orders several times. I sent them into battles with extremely low survival rates or drove their comrades to their deaths for minor mistakes.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Except for Seris, they’ve never rebelled against me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even Seris only refused orders I gave when I was half-crazed.
 </p>
 <p>
  They accepted other commands without complaint. It was for the sake of efficient strategies, but looking back, some of those orders were almost suicidal. Even the old Anytng would have seemed ridiculous.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I had thought more deeply…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Countless failures came to mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  Heroes who died due to my judgment errors. Among them were many who had the potential no less than the current main party. If I had pursued the strategy a bit more meticulously, they wouldn’t have had to die.
 </p>
 <p>
  Why didn’t I know?
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though I researched and analyzed so much.
 </p>
 <p>
  I never even imagined that the heroes of “Pick Me Up” were actually living beings. I just treated them recklessly with the prejudice of being a mobile game.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Master, what are you thinking?”

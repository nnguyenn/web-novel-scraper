  ‘I wonder if he properly checked the email I sent.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The main content was to apply for dispatch to Niflheimr, but I also attached two pieces of advice.

 <p>
  First, replenish your power with advanced summons. Second, don’t rely too much on my strategy and improve your own skills. The second one was a bit vague, but the first was straightforward.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How many people were allowed to the third floor? It should be the main two parties, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I tried to list the heroes that could be considered part of our party.
 </p>
 <p>
  Me, Jenna, Eloka, Velkist, Neryssa. In the second party, there were Edis and Roderick. In total, there were seven.
 </p>
 <p>
  [There are 15 on the third floor, including Loki, of course!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s twice as many.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yeah.]
 </p>
 <p>
  With 15 people…
 </p>
 <p>
  “I guess we can form a third party.”
 </p>
 <p>
  While I was away for training, it seemed like Anytng had been busy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Other heroes would probably be in a similar situation. Each of them would have improved by at least one level. I headed for the stairs. I wanted to take a look at the third floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is good. We’ll train for a day and the day after tomorrow. Then, three days later, we can start quickly from the 21st floor.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I mumbled as I walked.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, just before the stairs, I stopped. When I turned around, Iselle was hesitating.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why the long face? Did you eat something bad?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [No, it’s just…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle giggled awkwardly.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a strangely awkward expression.
 </p>

 <p>
  [Just don’t misunderstand. You know, Loki. When you weren’t here, Townia…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “No need to say it. I can guess.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was clear from the timing of Iselle’s hesitance.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You climbed the tower while I was gone, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Uh, yeah…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle nodded her head vaguely.
 </p>
 <p>
  As if she had committed a crime, her neck shrank.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why so stiff? It’s okay as long as it doesn’t ruin the strategy. Since there are 15 people on the third floor, it seems like no one died.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s right. No one died using the strategy.]
 </p>

 <p>
  When Jenna and I were absent, they still managed to climb a few floors.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s unexpected.’
 </p>
 <p>
  After the recent strike, Anytng had become quite cautious.
 </p>
 <p>
  He didn’t send parties into action until preparations were complete. But now, without the two main members of the first party, he executed the strategy.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, how many floors did you clear?”
 </p>
 <p>
  […25th floor.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “25th floor?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yeah.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not the 24th but the 25th. Is that right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Well, yes.]
 </p>

 <p>
  I took a step back on the stairs.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is a different story. I could understand if it were up to the 24th floor. These were sub-stages. It’s understandable since they weren’t special missions. But the 25th floor was different.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They beat the boss stage.’
 </p>
 <p>
  This is not something to joke about.
 </p>
 <p>
  The fact that Anytng sent a party, and the mission ended in success.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s definitely different.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As Iselle had mentioned, Townia had indeed changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  And it was in a direction I hadn’t expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, I guess the 25th floor was a small-scale mission.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It was a solo mission carried out by a single party. Since we were farming for Regen Stones, if you request it tomorrow when the Master logs in, you can watch the mission video.]
 </p>

 <p>
  I nodded thoughtfully.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The first party probably wasn’t involved in this mission.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Without Jenna and me, the formation wouldn’t be properly arranged.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if they filled the two spots with other members, the overall power would drop to less than half. There was no reason for Anytng to send out the first party.
 </p>
 <p>
  The situation wasn’t any different for the second party.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the 20th floor, two members died, and after that Aaron also left. Even with the addition of new power, it feels a bit lacking for a solo strategy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Therefore, there was only one possibility left.
 </p>
 <p>
  I spoke up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Iselle, when did the Master perform the advanced summon?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Just one month ago. As soon as Loki left for Niflheimr, he started summoning immediately.]
 </p>

 <p>
  “Show me the system log from that time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Wait a moment!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle started flipping through the ledger.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took a deep breath.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Anytng performed a paid gacha as soon as I left.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He was faithfully following my advice.
 </p>
 <p>
  The summoning date was one month ago. The heroes would have already adapted. As Iselle was rummaging through the ledger, her hand stopped.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ah, I found it! I’ll show it to you now.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The ledger Iselle was holding disappeared in a flash of light.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the same time, a holographic window appeared before me. It was a system message indicating the summoning.

 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes (Selected) / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  A 5-consecutive summon.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did he spend money?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master bought a package just before summoning.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The summoning screen continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, beginning the advanced summon. I’m looking forward to which heroes will appear!]

 <p>
  [Taak, dudururu]

 </p>
 <p>
  On the screen, a magic circle was drawn, and the hero’s name, grade, and illustration appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  The next summoning began.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Rare!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master ‘Anytng’ has acquired the hero ‘Nishazu (★★★)’!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Rare!]

 </p>
 <p>
  [Rare!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master ‘Anytng’ has acquired the hero ‘Nandio (★★★)’!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The fourth one.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the last.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I narrowed my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tuquakang!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Iselle: No, this feeling?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A powerful explosion sound echoed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “!★!Super!★!Rare!★!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master ‘Anytng’ has acquired the hero ‘Kishasha (★★★★)’!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The message continued.

 </p>
 <p>
  [A bond ‘Gale Running through the Forest’ has been formed!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You can turn it off now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The system log disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What a lucky guy.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He broke through the 1% odds twice.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anyway, the prediction had come true.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng had struck it big in the gacha.
 </p>
 <p>
  And if this was one month ago…

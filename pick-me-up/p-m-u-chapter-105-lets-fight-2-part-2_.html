 <p>
  And the next morning.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I came out, all four of them were gathered.
 </p>

 <p>
  Jenna, Eloka, Velkist, Neryssa. The purpose was simple: greetings and a report on recent events. Eloka had complained about why I ignored her yesterday, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  “You were asleep.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, I wasn’t sleeping…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then what were you doing?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s been a while since you left, so I was waiting to greet you properly!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay, okay, my bad for not waking you up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  After exchanging greetings with Neryssa as well, I moved on to the next topic. Eloka had suggested a small party, but I declined. I hadn’t come here to have fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re quite blunt. Really. No fun at all.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m sorry if it’s not fun. Anyway, while I was gone, you guys must have like crazy fun, right? After being stuck for a month, you must have been itching to move.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If the current floor was the 25th, we needed to catch up in terms of levels.
 </p>
 <p>
  We also needed to recover our teamwork, which had suffered due to our absence from actual combat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Training will start this afternoon. When the Master arrives…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thump.
 </p>
 <p>
  The floor beneath the table shook.
 </p>
 <p>
  It quieted down a moment later, as if to say, “Did that just happen?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A little mouse has arrived.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I laughed.

 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  I kicked under the table with my foot.
 </p>
 <p>
  The cold spot caved in, and wooden splinters scattered in the air. The large wooden table flipped over into the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did I get caught?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you’re going to hide, at least hide properly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the spot where the table used to be, a young girl was squatting.
 </p>
 <p>
  She had black hair and wore a one-piece dress made of animal skin. She might look older, but she was probably twelve or thirteen at most. She was still a child.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmph, if I got caught, it can’t be helped!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The little girl stood up with her nose in the air.

  “I am Lacari Vikchavi! A proud member of the Gale Tribe. I’m different from you dirty and mortal humans!”
 </p>
 <p>
  She had a proud expression, her nose held high.
 </p>
 <p>
  “… “
 </p>
 <p>
  None of the five of us reacted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hahaha! Are you all scared to the point of being speechless? Of course. From the start, I’m different from you humans…Augh!!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Lacari was suddenly hanging in my grasp.
 </p>
 <p>
  “H-let me go! Dirty human!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is this? Some kind of monkey?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m a member of the third party.”

 <p>
  Neryssa said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Summoned a month ago.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I know. It’s just different from what I was expecting.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You, let go!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lacari screamed and struggled.
 </p>
 <p>
  I grabbed the little one’s collar and shook her vigorously. Like a marionette, Lacari’s body swayed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Cowardly…! Just as despicable and filthy as humans!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why did you come in the first place? What do you want?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Too noisy! Hey, you there! The weakling who got beaten up by your sister yesterday! Help me right now!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist’s eyebrows twitched.

 <p>
  His hand got closer to his scabbard. Jenna awkwardly chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, bro. Using a sword on a kid…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Does this kid look like innocent?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh? But…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I stepped back.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lacari, who had rushed at me, smashed the chair in front of me in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Phew, dodged it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lacari brushed her hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her hands had long, sharp claws.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is that?”
 </p>

  “All the members of the third party are beastmen. They belong to an extremely rare race that resides in the far east of the Empire.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lacari bared her fangs.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmph, talkative talkative. Come on, you humans! I won’t leave a single one of you…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist’s scabbard struck her on the back of her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lacari collapsed without even screaming.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Noisy little thing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist muttered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Their way of thinking is different from ours. It seems they don’t like humans much. But to me, they don’t seem much different from humans.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s because they’re a sub-race.”

 <p>
  I looked down at Lacari.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A gale that runs through the forest.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the name of the bond generated in consecutive draws.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having a bond meant that all four of them, including this one, were of the same race.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A beastmen race.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Similar to humans but also different.
 </p>
 <p>
  I thought of a few cases. Occasionally, in the draws, beings of a different race from humans would appear. They had slightly different characteristics from ordinary human heroes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “She’s cute.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna poked Lacari’s cheek.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was a blush on her cheek where baby fat hadn’t disappeared.
 </p>

 <p>
  “But personality-wise, she seems pretty bad.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oppa, what do you plan to do? Wake her up and send her back like this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna turned to me and asked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, I’m not sure.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lacari’s body was twitching; it seemed like she was going to wake up soon.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s gotten quite annoying.’
 </p>
 <p>
  According to Velkist, the third party didn’t seem to be cooperative with us.
 </p>
 <p>
  While they might be helpful in performing missions individually, working together would be really difficult.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You guys stay here. I’ll try talking to them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is it okay for you to go alone?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s the point of you coming with me? Are you going to start a fight?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I lifted Lacari with one hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  It felt like about 30 kg. It was incredibly light.
 </p>
 <p>
  “During my absence, do some training or something.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Senior, remember what I told you yesterday. This kid is nothing special, but the others are a bit different.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll keep that in mind.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Leaving my party members behind, I walked out into the corridor.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the crossroads, I met someone.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Han…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How have you been?”
 </p>

 <p>
  It was Edis.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Unfortunately, I don’t have time for greetings. I’m a bit busy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis glanced at Lacari in my arms.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That kid…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I heard she’s hard to handle. Is that right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sorry, I tried to persuade her, but she wouldn’t listen.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems like it’s not a cooperative relationship.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Our mission is to go out. But it’s a bit unusual. To be honest, I don’t really understand.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis shook her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s talk about it later. See you in a bit.”
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-15" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 </div>
 <p>
  I continued walking.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since Edis came from the central corridor, the place with the third party should be the right corridor.
 </p>
 <p>
  As I approached the middle of the corridor.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hat!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lacari suddenly opened her eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her big eyes locked onto me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You, you, you cowardly…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you awake?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lacari wriggled in my grip.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before she could extend her claws, I reached out like lightning and grabbed her wrist. Gently.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, owowowowow!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t thrash around. I might accidentally break your arm.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You, you! After doing this to me…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I shook Lacari vigorously, holding onto her clothing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lacari’s body spun around like a top. After a while, her screams subsided.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Now it’s a bit quieter.’

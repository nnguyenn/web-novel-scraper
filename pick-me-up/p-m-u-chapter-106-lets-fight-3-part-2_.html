  I lowered my sword. When I looked at my left forearm, blood was flowing. I had scraped my forearm in the process.

  [Kishasha Bicshavi (★★★★) Lv. 22 (Exp 32/180)]

 </p>
 <p>
  [Imprint Slots: 1/1]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Slot 1: Descendant of the Beast King (B+, Lv.3)]
 </p>
 <p>
  [A descendant of the Beast King who once contested the dominance of the Empire and the continent. The bloodline of a fearless warrior.]
 </p>
 <p>

 <p>
  I let out a bitter smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  She had the upper hand in all stats.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s to be expected.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The base stats she possessed were different.
 </p>
 <p>
  Judging by the total, it seemed like her growth rate was outstanding. If I were to undergo enhancements in the future, I could make up for the lacking stats, but for now, there was no way.
 </p>
 <p>
  Furthermore, she had top-notch skills like Intermediate Martial Arts and even an Imprint. In other words…

 <p>
  “She’s in the top tier among 4-stars.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In terms of numerical values, she clearly outclassed me.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a game that relied solely on stats, this would be fine. But ‘Pick Me Up’ wasn’t that kind of game.
 </p>
 <p>
  In battles where the outcome was clear-cut, there were always chances for an upset, whether it was a mission or a duel between heroes.
 </p>
 <p>
  She had the bloodline of the Beast King.
 </p>
 <p>
  From birth, she was a powerhouse. She probably had her own abilities, but she seemed to be a natural-born prodigy.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But that doesn’t mean I can’t win.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I don’t like feeling frustrated.
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled and adjusted my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ll fight for whatever reason. I had already forgotten the fact that the opponent before me looked like a teenager in her mid-teens.

  “If you won’t come to me, then I’ll go to you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I raised my sword and bent my lower body.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment, stardust sparkled from the side. Iselle. I stopped her before she could intervene.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t stop me. We don’t intend to kill each other. It’s just a greeting. Isn’t that right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehe! You know what’s up. Right, this is a conversation of body and body. A ritual to establish camaraderie. You’re a human, but I like you!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m glad to hear that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I jumped lightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  And swung heavily.
 </p>
 <p>
  I discarded similar tricks. Only heavy strikes. I didn’t have the talent to master all forms of swordplay like Ridgion. Therefore, I had to focus on one thing. Realizing that fact was the key to mastering the Heavenly Sword Spirit.

  “Heavy Sword.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  The solid blade of Bifrost struck Kishasha.
 </p>
 <p>
  A strong shockwave hit her face. Kishasha, who was standing, slid several meters on the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is exciting!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha burst into laughter.
 </p>
 <p>
  Simultaneously, she charged at me, kicking up the dirt floor. I welcomed her willingly. Kishasha attacked me with every part of her body, from her hands and feet to her elbows and knees.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hand-to-hand combat and swordsmanship. In cases like this, the one with a weapon had a clear advantage, but Kishasha deftly avoided my sword and sometimes clashed with it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha lowered her body as if she were bowing.
 </p>
 <p>
  The blade that passed above her sliced through a tree. The severed tree slid to the left. As it fell, dust billowed up, and a fist flew through the dust. Just brushing it caused blood to spatter.

  Amidst the ongoing battle, where I smashed and shattered trees, dirt, and rocks without mercy.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s time to shift gears.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Fighting like this was fine, but it didn’t suit my temperament.
 </p>
 <p>
  She was hiding her full power. I was too. I had already shown enough. It was time to move on.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Frenzy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Hot blood surged in my head.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★★★)’ has entered a frenzy state!]
 </p>
 <p>
  My vision became heated.
 </p>
 <p>
  I exerted strength in my hands and waist. The three-hit combo, carrying immense weight, struck Kishasha. Kishasha flew like a cannonball and crashed into a pile of dirt.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Frenzy reached level 7, the added stat values broke through 15. When combined with Heavenly Sword Spirit, I could wield a pure strength of nearly 80.

  “Let’s finish this.”

 <p>
  I said while looking at the swirling dust.
 </p>
 <p>
  “My schedule is quite busy as it is. I have other things to do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Are you gonna use it too?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Each Imprint came with a unique skill.
 </p>
 <p>
  Their usefulness varied, but the Descendant of the Beast King that Kishasha possessed was rated B+. It was a fairly high grade.
 </p>
 <p>
  A shadow rose from the dust.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Unique skill, Transformation activated!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Kishasha (★★★★)’ transforms!]
 </p>
 <p>
  A low growl resonated.

  There was no trace of the young girl’s voice. It was a pure beast’s cry. And…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A tiger’
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now I understood why she was called a half-beast. What emerged from the dust was a giant beast. Approximately 2 meters in size. It was much larger than what I had seen in the zoo.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that your true form?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Her tail behind her back swayed left and right.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her entire body was covered in thick stripes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha didn’t reply.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead, she took a step forward with only her upper body.

  ‘This is what you call a jackpot.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Her individual combat power was excellent.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition, she had the ability to transform.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although her temperament was somewhat unusual, it was within an acceptable range.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It will be of great help for our strategy.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If only I could handle it properly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If you want to fight, I’ll do as you wish.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I aimed my sword at her.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her fangs bared towards my face.
 </p>
 <p>
  And…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Roar!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha roared charging at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  And I also ran towards her.

  Entering the training ground, all the members of the first party were waiting.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna, who had been handling a bow at the shooting range, rushed over.

 <p>
  “How did it go?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How did it go? It was resolved well. They will continue as they are. We only need to focus on our situation here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I replied while looking around.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Training Ground Lv.4]
 </p>
 <p>
  The structure of the training ground changed as the level increased.
 </p>
 <p>
  The biggest change was that each party was assigned its own training area. There were only five people in this spacious training ground, including me. I heard that there was a training area for the second party behind the next door.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Come to think of it, I didn’t hear about the status of the second party.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Meeting Edis briefly was the only encounter.
 </p>
 <p>
  They had surely filled the five slots, but I didn’t know their current status exactly. However, there shouldn’t be any advanced heroes. Looking at the logs, there had been no summons since Anytng got Kishasha in a 5-consecutive summon.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Originally he planned to summon five and put them into the second and third parties.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Luckily or unluckily, due to the whims of fate, he couldn’t put advanced heroes into the second party.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, Edis had to fill the ranks with lower-tier heroes who had been almost neglected.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is she okay?’
 </p>
 <p>
  When I saw her in the morning, her complexion wasn’t good.
 </p>
 <p>
  Maybe it was just because it had been a while since I had seen her.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There’s no need to worry about others.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I forced a smile and spoke.

 <p>
  Everyone’s attention was focused on me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Have you had breakfast? We’re starting right away. We’ve rested for a month, so we’ll be stepping up the difficulty. Keep up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  We started with running.
 </p>
 <p>
  While running along the track, I checked the condition of each member one by one.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘All their levels are the same.’
 </p>
 <p>
  There were significant differences in their skills, but their levels and the experience points of those in the back rows were unchanged.
 </p>
 <p>
  After Edis and I left, they hadn’t gone through even a single mission. It was probably Anytng’s choice. It seemed like he thought that filling them with different heroes wouldn’t make much difference.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘We’re falling behind the third party.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The levels of those who were summoned much later than us were in their early to mid-20s.
 </p>
 <p>
  To catch up with them, we needed to increase the pace.

  “Enhanced Quiver?”
 </p>
 <p>
  When did they put that in?
 </p>
 <p>
  Certainly, when I looked at her, she had a strange black quiver hanging from her waist. The enhanced quiver was an item exclusive to archers that significantly increased the arrow capacity.

  I sat on a bench on the third-floor plaza and stared at the control screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Gift Shop!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Purchased ‘Warhorse Statue’ for 5,000 Gold.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Giving ‘Warhorse Statue’ to ‘Han (★★★)’!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the warehouse.
 </p>
 <p>
  The door opened, and Iselle was flying over.
 </p>
 <p>
  In her arms, she held a familiar statue.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Loki, Master gave you another gift.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle was smiling happily.

  I accepted the brown statue.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Han (★★★) is disappointed by receiving the ‘Warhorse Statue.’]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Affinity decreased!]
 </p>
 <p>
  I threw the statue into the fountain.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle jumped in and placed the warhorse statue on a stand next to the fountain. There were two identical items next to it. Did she put them there?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stop sending me these things. Are you trying to collect trophies or something?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I thought you’d like them.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Give me something useful, or just feed me. There’s no use for these.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Alright, just wait.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle disappeared with a pout.

  [Tips/Regarding Affinity]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, if gifts lower the hero’s affinity, try changing the type. Affinity is an important indicator for increasing a hero’s responsiveness.]
 </p>
 <p>
  After reading the message.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng entered the gift shop again.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Gift Shop!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Purchased ‘White Horse Statue’ for 8,000 Gold.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Giving ‘White Horse Statue’ to ‘Han (★★★)’…]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The ‘White Horse Statue’ you gave was smashed!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Han (★★★) is greatly disappointed!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Affinity significantly decreased!]
 </p>
 <p>
  After that, Anytng didn’t open the gift shop.
 </p>
 <p>
  For about 5 minutes, there was no response, and she silently sent the prospective combatants to the dungeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Are you upset?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  It doesn’t just have to be something different. I’m only willing to accept it if it’s useful.
 </p>
 <p>
  But that’s not the issue here.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sat on the bench and waited for Anytng to finish his work. He sent the combatants to the lower missions, dispatched the auxiliary team to the weekday dungeons, crafted items, and upgraded heroes. He seemed quite busy.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Because the scale has increased quite a bit.’
 </p>
 <p>
  There were nearly 100 heroes in this waiting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to when we dealt with at most 10 or 20, it was going to be a handful.

 <p>
  There was one reason why I waiting for Anytng.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The 25th floor.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the floor cleared by the third party.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though the mission had been cleared, it still mattered to me, and I wasn’t going to let it slide.
 </p>
 <p>
  There had to be something there. I needed to examine the mission’s video.

  Three bolts were shot towards Priasys.

 </p>
 <p>
  Flash.
 </p>
 <p>
  The space next to Priasis distorted, and shadows burst forth.
 </p>
 <p>
  The shadows swatted away the three bolts with a wave of their hand and immediately lunged at the crossbowmen.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is that…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The crossbowman’s words went unfinished.
 </p>
 <p>
  Their heads were crushed without a trace.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It smells like dirty humans. A lot.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lacari chuckled and brushed off her hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thin, bright red blood splattered on the bricks. Lacari grinned, showing off her nearly 30 cm long claws.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sister, can I kill all the humans here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Leave that one.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha appeared next, asking, “Do you know Priasis Al What’s-her-name?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I… um…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha didn’t listen to the response.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This one has to be spared. She’s our mission target.”

  “Too bad, but we can’t do anything about the others.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who are you people?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kill the rest.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This woman is a top-tier wanted criminal of the Empire. If you dare to fight us…What the…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The boy’s voice faltered sadly.
 </p>
 <p>
  His body, with a large hole in the chest, collapsed into pieces. Lacari, who had killed the boy in an instant, tore apart the head of the man next to him on both sides. Blood gushed like a fountain.
 </p>
 <p>
  “D-Damn it… Where did these things come from?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The bewildered guards tightened their grip on their weapons.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hear us out! We don’t intend to fight you. We’re here to capture that witch…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is why humans are irritating. What’s the point of listening to things we’re going to kill?”

 <p>
  No questions, no hesitation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha, Lacari, and three other beastwomen pulled out their claws and slaughtered the surrounding guards.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Effective tactics.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If they had been given even a little time, the guards would have prepared a counterattack. But the third party didn’t give them that chance. They assessed the situation as soon as they arrived…
 </p>
 <p>
  I let out a bitter laugh.
 </p>
 <p>
  They killed everyone as soon as they appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nine headless bodies sprawled out in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  The last middle-aged man remaining sat down on the ground. The hem of his pants turned yellow.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You crazy bastards…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The man muttered in a helpless voice.
 </p>

 <p>
  The next moment, the man lost his neck.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha withdrew her claws and looked at Priasis.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Human female. Follow me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who are you…? Are you from the Beastfolk? How can Beastfolk, who are only in the tropical region, be here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha ignored Priasis’s question and turned her gaze.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nishazu. Do you hear that strange sound? I can smell blood. Find out what’s going on.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, sister.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Nishazu leaped high.
 </p>
 <p>
  The jumping distance was about 2 meters. Nishazu leaped onto the roof after jumping again from the tent.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha stared at the empty air and murmured.
 </p>

  “Mission type: Escape. Get out of the designated location. With this NPC?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasys took a step forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her voice had become noticeably more refined.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you the heroes from back then? You saved me!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you talking about?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “She’s a noisy human. Maybe she’ll quiet down if I tear off one of her arms?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis’s complexion turned pale.
 </p>
 <p>
  But she clenched her lips, refusing to yield, and spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “By any chance, among your group, is there a man named Han? I’ll describe him to you. Black hair, black eyes. He’s a head taller than me, wields a sword and shield, and speaks gruffly.”

 <p>
  “What nonsense…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The human warrior.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha interrupted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “A black-haired human who wields a sword and shield. Han. Are you referring to that warrior?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You know him! I’m looking for news of that man. If you came from the same place, Han…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He used to be around. But not anymore.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis’s face hardened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “W-What are you talking about? Could it be…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I heard he went to a strange place called Niflle-what again?! Anyway, he might be dead, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, that…”

 <p>
  ‘Why are you treating me like a dead person?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I was left dumbfounded by this conversation.
 </p>
 <p>
  From Kishasha’s perspective, that human had never existed in the first place, so it wasn’t unreasonable for her to speak like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anyway, we’re busy because of the mission. If possible, stay out of our way and follow us quietly. The bastards will be here soon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha said, looking across the street.
 </p>
 <p>
  I also shifted my gaze in that direction. The pedestrians who were coming and going were hiding. The blood that was shed here was one reason, but there seemed to be a bigger reason.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sister!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A beast-woman jumped down from the third floor of a building with a light landing.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was Nishazu.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Monsters are coming from outside the village. It looks like they’ll break through soon.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “So that’s why it was calm even though we caused such chaos.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha lightly tapped the remains of a guard who had lost his arms and legs.
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed. Compared to the size of the village, the numbers were far too few. Other soldiers probably couldn’t come here due to other problems.
 </p>
 <p>
  I listened carefully.
 </p>
 <p>
  Somewhere in the distance, screams and clashing sounds mixed harshly. It was a unique noise amidst the intense battle.

 </p>
 <p>
  “For now, let’s get out of here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha leaped to the other side.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Humph, how ironic of you dirty humans.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lacari glanced briefly at Priasis’s face and spoke as if vomiting, then followed Kishasha.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come with us, human.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…It’s not certain yet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you talking about?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Forget it. Just follow us.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis raised her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  And she looked straight in my direction.

  Our eyes met.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ahem.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I gave a light cough, but it seemed that Priasis didn’t hear it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon, she disappeared into the mix of the three parties.

  -The party pursued their way.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha led the group with the remaining three members running side by side, keeping pace beside and behind. Priasis trailed a few steps behind, barely keeping up with the party.

 <p>
  “Human, can’t you run a bit faster?” Lacari, who was at the back, urged.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is my limit,” Priasis replied, panting, biting her lips.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was only natural. Perhaps due to their species’ characteristics, the party’s speed was excessively fast compared to other heroes at the same level. I had to exert all my strength just to keep up. There was no way Priasis could keep pace.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s no other choice. Let’s slow down,” Kishasha said.
 </p>
 <p>
  The party’s pace slowed down to a mere walk.
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis wiped the sweat from her forehead.
 </p>
 <p>
  After about ten minutes had passed, Kishasha stopped as they reached the center of the village. Kishasha looked out over the market, where numerous tents were spread out.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Daruma!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I just got here, sis.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Someone leaped down from the tents.
 </p>
 <p>
  Another half-beast girl. She was one of the third party members who had fallen behind when the party started moving.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There are three exits. To the west, east, and north. The monsters are swarming at the west gate. Humans are fleeing from the east gate, and the north gate seems somewhat empty.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha put her hand on her chin, deep in thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  A mission to escape the field with NPC in tow.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like she was contemplating where to escape. The party had a brief waiting period.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sat down under a palm tree stump, looking to my side. Far away, people were running from the main road. At the forefront was a procession of luxurious carriages. They seemed to be nobles. Behind them were burly men who appeared to be merchants, and at the rear were women and children.
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis watched the scene with distant eyes.

 <p>
  “They’re… going to get caught soon,” she muttered with a sigh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lacari, who had been staring with a gloomy expression, spoke up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t care what happens to these dirty humans.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned my gaze to the right.
 </p>
 <p>
  The high walls surrounding the city had long crumbled, and the city was burning from end to end. The screams, clangs, and roars of monsters mingled and echoed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The 25th floor is not a defensive mission.’
 </p>
 <p>
  We barely defended the city on the 10th floor, but the situation is different now. The party had changed, and the mission had taken on a different aspect. There was no need to risk their lives to protect them.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I don’t think they can protect them anyway.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [Lizardman Lv.21] X 415
 </p>
 <p>
  The number of lizardmen displayed in the mission status window kept increasing.

 <p>
  On the other hand, the number of human soldiers steadily decreased. From 3 to 1, then 4 to 1, and now 5 to 1. The multiplier increased exponentially.
 </p>
 <p>
  The walls had already been breached, and the village was under attack from all directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  In any case, this village was doomed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve made up my mind. We need to go north. How many monsters are there?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “When I went, there were about 30.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s enough. Let’s break through there. Everyone, gather! Human female, you too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait a moment! I have something to say.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis spoke up.
 </p>
 <p>
  She had a fearful expression, but her eyes were deeply determined.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Heroes, can’t you… help them?”

  “What nonsense is this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’ll only take five minutes. Just five minutes and these people can escape safely. If you just hold them off at the main road…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha’s expression froze for a moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis continued without backing down.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I know it’s shameless to make such a dangerous request to those you owe your life to. But, but! They’re innocent civilians. What if you…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Whether thousands or tens of thousands of humans die, what does it matter to us? When these bastards were slaughtering our people, where were they? This scum needs to die right now…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lacari approached Priasis with a determined expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stop.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha reached out to stop Lacari.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t touch her.”

  “Just let her know that it’s impossible.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha said firmly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Human, I’m sorry, but we can’t grant your request.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you sure about that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a firm no.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis closed her eyes tightly and then knelt down at that moment.

  [Sometimes, during missions, subquests may appear. Subquests are not directly related to the ongoing mission, but completing them can earn you great rewards. Just remember that there may be risks involved!]

 <p>
  Kishasha’s face grimaced as she examined the quest log.
 </p>
 <p>

  Logs continued to appear.

 <p>
  ‘Looks like she got involved here.’

  I had expected it.

  Occasionally, NPCs would give quests during missions. Completion was optional. You would receive a modest reward upon clearing them, but refusing them wouldn’t result in significant losses.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at Priasis.
 </p>
 <p>
  She remained kneeling on the sand, her eyes tightly closed.
 </p>
 <p>
  However…
 </p>
 <p>
  [3. Refuse (Selected)]
 </p>
 <p>
  [I decline the quest.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng immediately refused.

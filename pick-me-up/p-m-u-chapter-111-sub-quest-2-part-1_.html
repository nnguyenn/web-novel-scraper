 <p>
  I extended my hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  A single grain of sand, carried by the wind, settled onto my palm. The heat beat down on my skin. The air was hot and humid, just as I had expected, matching the weather of this scorching desert.

 <p>
  “It’s hot.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist squinted his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But what is this woman doing?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “She seems to have a request for us.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As if sensing the change, Priasis, who had been kneeling quietly, half-opened her eyes. Her golden irises locked onto me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You, you…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Been well, little one?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How did you end up here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Her eyes were trembling.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Weren’t you looking for me? I came all this way for you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The people that were in front of me…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They are resting at home, sound asleep. Don’t worry about them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can’t understand. Did you use magic? No, even with magic, this…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now is not the time to chitchat, is it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Srrk.
 </p>
 <p>
  A sword emerged from its sheath.
 </p>
 <p>
  I spoke while extending the sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  “First, we need to clear out those over there.”

 <p>
  On the other side of the street.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hundreds of Lizardmen were forming a crowd, heading toward the refugee procession. The distance between both sides was getting shorter by the moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If we can buy some time for the people to escape, that should do it, right? It’s a mission I like.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna drew her bow from her back.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist and Neryssa followed suit by unsheathing their weapons.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No time to spare. Let’s move.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I immediately started walking in one direction.
 </p>
 <p>
  The other four members of Party 1 followed suit.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you… intend to grant my request?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis chased after me with hesitant steps.

  “Can’t you see? We’re going.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I took out a vial of blue liquid from my pouch.
 </p>
 <p>
  Heat-resistant potion. To Anytng, it would appear as a regular potion. I opened the lid and took a sip. The other four also started drinking their potions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Quest in progress.”
 </p>

  The preparations were complete.
 </p>
 <p>
  The rest will be wiped out.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have so much to say to you. I can’t even count them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis smiled faintly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But I won’t get in your way. Thank you for your help.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You understand well. Stay behind us, don’t step forward.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She listens well.

  I do have quite a bit to say to this girl, but it’s not the right time for it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ““I also express my gratitude to the other warriors. The others I saw back then were quite noticeable.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hello.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna grinned.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka nodded gracefully.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The two who used a spear and a dagger…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Edis and Aaron are alive and well. They’re somewhere else.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Everyone is safe… That’s a relief.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re moving in soon. Be careful.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The end of the alley is in sight.

  Priasis nodded with a tense expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is the real deal.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Crash. Clatter, clatter.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sound of boiling from the narrow wall on the opposite side could be heard.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the distinctive cry of the Lizardmen. I reached for the dagger sheathed on my belt with my left hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you have anything else to say?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can’t we just sweep them away in front?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But don’t rush ahead alone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I stopped walking.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the same time, the movement of the group ceased. The alleyway took a turn in the opposite direction.

  Their cries were clear. They were right in front of us. I pointed at Priasis with my hand and then gestured toward a trash can. Priasis rushed over and crouched behind the trash can. Next, I extended three fingers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Three.
 </p>
 <p>
  Two.
 </p>
 <p>
  One.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Charge.”
 </p>
 <p>
  We dashed out of the alley.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aaaah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Save us, save us!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Crash, crash!
 </p>
 <p>
  The screams of humans and the chilling cries of the Lizardmen.

 <p>
  The sounds of weak flesh being torn mixed together to form a gruesome symphony.
 </p>
 <p>
  The eyes of the Lizardman, who had been stabbing a fallen woman on the roadside with a sword, met mine.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yellow eyes with elongated pupils quivered in their sockets.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kyrk?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  The dagger I threw in an instant pierced the Lizardman’s eye all the way to the hilt.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kkieeek!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I lowered my posture and rushed forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the greatsword swung horizontally, the Lizardman’s neck flew into the air. The headless body tilted to the ground, spewing blood like a fountain. It wasn’t just one.
 </p>
 <p>
  I quickly adjusted my stance and thrust twice.
 </p>
 <p>
  Two Lizardmen, unaware of the situation, were impaled by my sword and fell lifeless.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Lizardman Lv.21] X 17
 </p>
 <p>
  “17 of them. Clear them within 10 seconds!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pop, pop, pop!
 </p>
 <p>
  Arrows were released as soon as they were nocked on Jenna’s shortbow.
 </p>
 <p>
  Three arrows hit three targets in rapid succession. Neryssa used her daggers to finish off the three wounded Lizardmen that Jenna had hit with arrows.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s chaotic out here. The weather doesn’t help.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka muttered.
 </p>
 <p>
  The street was already a mess of human and Lizardman corpses. Buildings were ablaze.

  “If it weren’t for the potions you gave us, things could have gone south. Anyway, you said it was versatile.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka began casting a spell.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her lips moved and in the next moment,
 </p>
 <p>
  Kwakwakwak!
 </p>
 <p>
  Flames exploded.
 </p>
 <p>
  The two Lizardmen caught in the explosion turned to dust and vanished.
 </p>
 <p>
  High-speed chant. Eloka had recently mastered a new spell of the Fire Magic class.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kiralalala!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A Lizardman leaped and swung a polearm.
 </p>
 <p>
  Standing at around 2 meters tall, its distinctive slender body moved flexibly. I swung my sword to counter it. Bifrost’s thick blade sliced through the polearm effortlessly and then cleaved the creature’s torso in one fell swoop. The upper half of the Lizardman’s body flew into the sky, spewing blood and organs like a fountain.

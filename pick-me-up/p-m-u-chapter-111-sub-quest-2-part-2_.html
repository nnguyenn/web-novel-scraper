 <p>
  The street was already covered in blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  The woman crouching muttered absentmindedly.

 <p>
  “How on earth did this happen…”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They still can’t see us.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The complexion of the woman who had been looking at the bloodstains turned pale.
 </p>
 <p>
  “G-Ghost? Is there a ghost?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Survivors began emerging from various places.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were hiding between buildings, under tables, and beneath fruit crates.
 </p>
 <p>
  They scrutinized the area where we stood with bewildered expressions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This feels strange.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna remarked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s not worry about it. We just need to do our job.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Those people don’t seem to have any intention of fleeing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then they’ll have no choice but to perish, won’t they?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist swept his blade clean.
 </p>
 <p>
  The street was drenched in blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They can see the traces we left.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The people around were trembling.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh, a ghost?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not a ghost.”

 <p>
  From an alley, Priasis appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis spoke with a stern expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you stay here, you’ll die. Go to the east gate.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “And you? What on earth just happened?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They’re protecting us.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis glanced briefly at us.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems like only I can see them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you controlling these monsters?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t have that kind of power. I just made a request.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A soldier emerged from the group of survivors.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Don’t make me laugh! I know who you are. Priasis, the Empire’s traitor! You summoned demons by selling your soul, right? And that transparent monster over there… Bugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The soldier who had been struck hard in the back of his head collapsed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Behind him, a young woman holding a shovel was breathing heavily.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You soldiers. Using nobles as a shield to flee. Anyway, thanks. All we have to do is run to the gate, right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  The woman looked around at the survivors and spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Everyone, let’s go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Whether it’s a demon or a ghost, thanks to you, we’re alive. We won’t forget.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The people formed a procession and began heading towards the eastern gate.

 <p>
  Seeing this, Priasis sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems like it worked somehow.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But this place is not safe.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Lizardman Lv. 21] X 93
 </p>
 <p>
  [Lizardman Shaman Lv. 25] X 5
 </p>
 <p>
  Across the main road.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nearly a hundred Lizardmen were gathering in groups and coming our way.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘How much time do we have left?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the bottom of the quest window.
 </p>
 <p>
  The timer was displayed so small that it wouldn’t be visible without focusing.
 </p>

  [00:10:00]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Ten minutes.’
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Isn’t the number a bit too much?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis’ expression stiffened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kyrk!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The head of a human wearing a helmet was impaled on the spears of the leading Lizardmen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis clenched her teeth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We have to hold on for just ten minutes and then we can leave. Keep our movements to a minimum. Spread out the distance. It’ll be difficult if we get surrounded.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The field was linear.
 </p>
 <p>
  As long as we defended well from the front, there was no need to worry about being attacked from behind.
 </p>

 <p>
  It was a better situation than the fifth floor, where we had to defend three places.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Look, do you see the red-eyed lizard?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We just need to defeat that one.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, it’s annoying if we leave it alone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom! Boom! Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  The sound of drums began to echo. It seemed like the Lizardmen in the rear were beating drums.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kruck!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kiralak!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Both sides stopped, leaving a 10-meter gap between them.
 </p>
 <p>
  A Lizardman wearing a red feathered robe and holding a curved staff walked to the front of the formation. He spoke in the human language from his protruding mouth.

  “Krarak! Humans who reject order!”

 <p>
  Surprisingly, he was fluent.

 <p>
  [Lizardman Chieftain Lv. 28]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why do you defy the providence of nature? Kruck! I will bring divine punishment to this unholy land…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thwack!
 </p>
 <p>
  An arrow flew rapidly and pierced the chieftain’s throat. Thud.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Lizardman chieftain’s body slumped forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Should we kill those guys?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Correct.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled and adjusted my sword.

 <p>
  “Ki-yaaa! Ki-yaaaah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Life drained from the eyes of the Lizardmen in unison.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why so much talk when we’re here to fight? Come at us.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Doo-doo-doo-doo.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hundreds of Lizardmen began charging, kicking up dust.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you sure about this, Han? There are so many. We don’t have to take them all at once.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re the one who asked for this, and now you’re complaining?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I readied my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  “A hundred of them. Just handle twenty each. It’s simple.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You can watch from behind.”
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s an undeniable difference between the me on the 15th floor and the me now.
 </p>
 <p>
  But it’s not just me. The members of the first party were the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  【Ignite, Explode!】
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Flames erupted from Eloka’s feet and engulfed the front of the Lizardmen.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the same time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  A violent explosion accompanied the intense flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if they were desert Lizardmen accustomed to heat, they couldn’t withstand the flames themselves. The burnt bodies of the Lizardmen became carried away by the wind. The flames, undeterred by the explosion, blazed fiercely on the street.
 </p>

  “Let’s go in.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That was the plan.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I ran forward with Velkist.
 </p>
 <p>
  We were heading towards the blazing street.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ping! Ping!
 </p>
 <p>
  Even amidst all this, Jenna’s arrows sliced through the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  She didn’t hold back, and Lizardmen hit by her arrow bombardment fell like straw bundles. Jenna had more than 100 spare arrows in her expanded quiver.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ki-yaaa!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A Lizardman with his leg on fire swung his spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no need to dodge. I raised my sword from below, cutting through the Lizardman’s scales and tearing him apart.

  [Skill Awakening!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★★★)’ has acquired the ‘Power Strike’ skill!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Power Strike.
 </p>
 <p>
  I knew I’d get it.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a simple yet powerful skill that added to your attack power.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Skill Awakening!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Velkist (★★★)’s ‘Low-Rank Swordsmanship’ has reached Lv.10!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Velkist (★★★)’s ‘Low-Rank Swordsmanship’ has reached its maximum level.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The second awakening followed.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was Velkist’s. No matter how hard you practice, there’s no substitute for real combat training. Velkist’s swordplay, which beheaded Lizardmen, gained even more speed. I also picked up the pace. Lizardmen fell one by one, spewing blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  We fought amidst the flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  Elokah’s flames gradually spread, skillfully devouring the field. The Lizardmen burned out like moths drawn to the flame. Neryssa’s rapier pierced the Lizardmen who broke through the wall of flames. Lizardman shamans were sniped by Jenna almost simultaneously.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is this the twenty-fifth one?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The flaming sword tore through the Lizardman.
 </p>
 <p>
  I quickly scanned the battlefield to find the next target. Then, I stepped out of the fiery zone.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They’re all dead.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Five minutes ago, there were a hundred Lizardmen here, but now they had all vanished without a trace.
 </p>
 <p>
  [00:04:38]
 </p>
 <p>
  They had all turned into lifeless corpses on the street.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sizzle. The smoke and the smell of burning flesh tickled my nose.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Quite an easy job, isn’t it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They’re no different from scarecrows.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist remarked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “These bastards are weaker than I expected.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis was looking at us with a vacant expression.

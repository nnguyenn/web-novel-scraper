  Starting from the next day, tower climbing began.
 </p>
 <p>
  We proved that the main party’s strength had returned with the 25th-floor quest. Anytng had no reason to hesitate. We immediately entered the rift of space and time.

  [Floor 26.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Mission Type – Escort]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Objective – Protect the designated individual.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The field was a desert.
 </p>
 <p>
  The mission’s content was just as expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  Beneath the scorching sun, I was able to reunite with Priasis in the desert. Priasis walked through the desert aimlessly, her body covered in a thin layer of silk.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aren’t you dead?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I said with a smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  It had only been a day for me, but a considerable amount of time had passed for her. Priasis’s gaze turned towards us.
 </p>
 <p>
  “As you can see… I’m alive. Although I was prepared. It’s been tough in its own way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis spoke with a tired voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her once bulging bag was now only half full. I tossed a bundle I had brought from the waiting room. Priasis hesitantly accepted it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It contains heat-resistant potions, water, and food. Use them well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I owe you a debt of gratitude…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis lifted the lid of the heat-resistant potion with sweaty hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t create these items. Anytng must have studied the basics of desert survival and ordered the alchemist from the 2nd floor to make them. There was no need for information manipulation anymore.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m seeing this woman again. What’s the mission this time?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s simple. Follow Priasis and protect her. You know the destination, right? Don’t get lost.”

  “I’ve seen it in my dreams several times. Just follow the signs.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis pointed to the endless horizon beneath the high dunes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sign? I don’t see it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Anyway, it didn’t matter as long as she knew the direction.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s drink these first.”
 </p>
 <p>
  We consumed the heat-resistant potion.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tips/Special Potion ‘Heat-Resistant Potion’ prevents dehydration and heatstroke. However, its effectiveness may be reduced during vigorous activities.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A refreshing sensation flowed through our bodies.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the scorching sun, I felt much better. I threw the empty bottle into a corner and reached for the hilt of my sword. Beyond the neighboring hill, a distinct cry could be heard.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Karrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrk!”

 </p>
 <p>
  A message indicating the appearance of enemies appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa went straight up the hill and said, “They’re in better shape than last time. They seem to be elite soldiers.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s perfect for post-meal exercise.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Get ready, everyone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  I drew my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kiaaaah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The torn upper bodies of the lizardmen flew with pitiful sounds.

  The 18th one. It didn’t take more than three minutes to deal with all of them. We encountered a few other groups along the way, but we defeated them one by one and continued through the desert.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Imperial Guards weren’t even this bad.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis, who had been watching, raised her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  Half a day passed like this. After crossing three hills,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stage Clear!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Velkist (★★★)’, ‘Neryssa (★★★)’ leveled up!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Reward – 50,000G, Essence of the Desert]
 </p>
 <p>
  [MVP – ‘Han (★★★)’]
 </p>
 <p>
  The stage clear message appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sheathed my sword. Night was falling on the yellow desert. Light enveloped us. I said to Priasis, who was looking at me.

  “See you on the next floor.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood, Han. On the next floor.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis lightly smiled and waved her hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  The background gradually blurred, and we returned through the rift of space and time.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t understand the meaning of this mission. Is it just about following the girl around?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Girl? Be careful with your words, Velkist.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa scolded him, and Velkist sulked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How great can she be? Is she the princess of the empire or something?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s correct.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Obviously not… huh? What did you say?”

 <p>
  Velkist’s face turned bewildered.
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled and left the rift of space and time.
 </p>
 <p>
  The next day, the exploration continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, the field was a desert as well. The difference was that it was nighttime instead of daytime. So, this time, we needed cold-resistant potions to ward off freezing temperatures, even though we were in the desert.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were similarities with the previous encounters.
 </p>
 <p>
  Somewhere, Lizardmen appeared, and we engaged in a fierce battle with them.
 </p>
 <p>
  As we ventured deeper into the desert, their numbers increased.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kirk! Those who disrupt the order, kill them, kill them!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kara-ralalak!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Lizardmen’ have entered a frenzied state!]

  They were not just simple enemies.
 </p>
 <p>
  They rushed towards us with clear hatred in their hearts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Monsters were rampaging all over the continent. What happened in the desert village was just a small piece of the whole. Priasis looked at the scattered Lizardmen corpses and said,
 </p>
 <p>
  “We don’t have much time. We need to hurry.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis opened her mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her silver hair shimmered in the moonlight.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If my dream is correct, there’s less than ten years until destruction.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You said you didn’t know what the keys were for. Why collect them?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a kind of proof. The keys are items passed down only in the empire’s founding myth. If I can obtain them, they will lend me their power.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If they will.”

  “The Assinis family.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis said with a determined expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They are one of the four great families and the empire’s strongest military force. I made a promise to them. To prove my worth. To do that, I have to make the impossible possible.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “And collecting the keys is that impossible task?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The answer came without hesitation.

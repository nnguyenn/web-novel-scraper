 <p>
  The next day, in the afternoon.
 </p>
 <p>
  The leaders of the five parties gathered in the lobby of the third-floor accommodations.

 <p>
  Each one of them, including Me, Edis, Kishasha, and the other two. It was to finalize opinions before departing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I didn’t expect you to be here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis said, looking at Kishasha.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha chuckled. “We’re all here with a mission. I have no intention of neglecting it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis nodded lightly to Kishasha.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You may not be a seasoned warrior, but you have good manners. That is inhumane.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll take that as a compliment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis turned her gaze away and took a deep breath.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was not the one who had gathered these five individuals. Edis had volunteered herself to lead. After exhaling deeply, Edis began speaking.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve called you all here to establish a command structure.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A command structure? What does that mean?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “With twenty-five members on the mission team, we need to appoint a captain. Too many cooks spoil the broth, after all.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I replied.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, so you mean to appoint a leader warrior? It’s easy to decide! Just pick the strongest?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Being strong doesn’t guarantee the ability to lead everyone well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis shook her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, she looked at me, sitting at one side of the table.

 <p>
  “I recommend Han. Among us, he has the most experience in missions, and his judgments and instructions are accurate. Anyone who has fought with him would agree.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis glanced at Kishasha and smiled lightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “He’s also a seasoned warrior.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Indeed. There should be no objections if we choose the Dragon Slayer warrior. However, we fight independently. It’s not about fighting together.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Does that mean…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll do it that way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But, Han…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The way the beastfolk fight is different from ours. Trying to force them to work together is not effective.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You know very well, warrior. Of course, we are not ignorant of the meaning of cooperation. We will respect your opinion within the mission.”
 </p>

 <p>
  I originally knew it would be like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sub-races in ‘Pick Me Up’ are generally stronger than humans, but tend to be less cooperative. It is better to leave it alone than to bring about conflict by inserting it. Of course, you will have to ask for their help if the mission requires it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you Han?”
 </p>
 <p>
  A middle-aged man in the corner of the table spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had a greatsword slung on his back.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I am Raiman from the 4th party. I’ve heard a lot about you. Do we just follow your orders?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I narrowed my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, but I’ll only give you basic instructions. The rest, you figure out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, I see.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “You can be kinder with your words,” Edis remarked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t add to it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the two newcomers.
 </p>
 <p>
  They must have had plenty of experience, especially in missions. However, this was their first boss stage. There was a subtle tension on their faces.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let me say this in advance, no matter what happens, don’t panic. Those who panic die first. There’s definitely a way to survive. Just remember that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “See, you can do it when you tr… Ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I cut Edis off with a firm step on her foot.
 </p>
 <p>
  The brief introduction was over. Next, I gave basic guidelines to the two new leaders. Never panic, no matter who among your team dies. Maintain composure in any situation. Remember teamwork.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Lastly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is it?”
 </p>

  “If you plan to fight recklessly, quit now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ve come a long way. We have no such intentions.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They’ll understand when they see.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Boss stages were completely different.
 </p>
 <p>
  If they do their part here and survive, I might acknowledge them as proper parties. But not now.
 </p>
 <p>
  The meeting dispersed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The scheduled date for the expedition was today. I returned to my room and put on the leather armor hanging on the stand. It had been modified for desert use, with white cloth wrapped around the connecting parts to block the sun’s rays.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then I packed the potions in my pouch.
 </p>
 <p>
  The supply distribution was completed yesterday. Three bottles of low-level health potions, and two bottles of heat resistance potions. I also added a water container filled to the brim. It was for replenishing fluids.
 </p>
 <p>
  Click.

 <p>
  I strapped the seven throwing knives into the knife pouch around my waist.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, I securely fastened Bifrost’s scabbard to my belt.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I opened the door and stepped out,
 </p>
 <p>
  Four members of the 1st party were waiting.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you ready?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re all set.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s nothing more to do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Have you written your will?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why? Did you write one, senior?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist chuckled.

  “Of course, I didn’t.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re not planning to die here. Right, everyone? Once again, Oppa will lead us.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aren’t you relying too much on me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your words are different. Usually, you tell me to follow orders.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I laughed and said, “Let’s go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The four of us stood up.
 </p>
 <p>
  They looked tense but relaxed. They had experienced their fair share of tough missions. No matter what situation arises, they will give their best.
 </p>
 <p>
  While walking through the corridor with the members of the 1st party, lights appeared in the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Welcome to Pick Me Up!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Now Loading…….]

 </p>
 <p>
  [TOUCH! (Select)]
 </p>
 <p>
  The main screen of Pick Me Up appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng immediately accessed the game and pressed the rift of time and space. Along with the status of the tower’s ascent, the party selection screen appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [1st Party!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle’s voice echoed throughout the waiting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  [2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th parties, assemble on the 1st floor!]
 </p>
 <p>
  When I looked to the side, the faces of the 2nd party were emerging from the opposite corridor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis led them, followed by Roderick, Annan, Benik, and Lilinia.
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis looked at me and said, “We will be helpful more than the 20th floor.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you talking about?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [“Forming the 1st Attack Unit (Small).”]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Party Formation – ‘1st Party’, ‘2nd Party’, ‘3rd Party’, ‘4th Party’, ‘5th Party’]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Total Hero Power – 25]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Commander – None]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Recommended Commander – ‘Han (★★★)’: A majority of party members recommend Han.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do you want to appoint ‘Han (★★★)’ as the commander?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes(Selected)/ No]
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled bitterly and went down the stairs.

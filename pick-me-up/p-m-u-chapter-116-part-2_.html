  And then…
 </p>
 <p>
  Ku-gu-gu-gu-gu-gung!

 <p>
  The ground began to shake violently from side to side.
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis, who had lost her footing, was caught by Jenna.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Be careful.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Thank you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oppa, what should we do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The ground continued to shake in a regular rhythm.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What can we do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I brought my hand to my ear.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Get out of here.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Click.
 </p>
 <p>
  I ended the communication.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We need to leave this city.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ku-gung!
 </p>
 <p>
  A part of the building in the square collapsed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Neryssa, where’s the nearest way out?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “To the southwest. I’ll guide you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Run!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa sprinted ahead.

 <p>
  I ran while placing my hand on the scabbard, ready to draw at any moment. Members of the 1st party followed me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kid!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m running too!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Klick. Kli-ri-ri-ri-ck.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mechanical sounds echoed under our feet.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What’s that sound?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I had no time to think.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sprinted down the street. Other parties followed closely behind.
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned at an intersection.
 </p>
 <p>
  The vibrations continued. Debris from the sand-covered buildings scattered in all directions.

 </div>
 <p>
  Crash!
 </p>
 <p>
  A crumbling pillar collapsed in front of me.
 </p>
 <p>
  The entire city was crumbling.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;What the heck is this?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m not your nanny!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Each time it shook, buildings toppled like dominoes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Behind, behind! Look at that!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eolka screamed in a voice almost like a shriek.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s really happening.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist chuckled.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  The height was about 20 meters, and the end was nowhere in sight.
 </p>
 <p>
  A colossal wave of sand was engulfing everything.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Oh, Ugh!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t bark, we don’t want to hear it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sizzle.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The 1st party will take the lead. Follow me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The sandstorm, as if it would obscure the sky, drew closer.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shadows fell on the street.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ku-gu-gu-gu-gung!
 </p>
 <p>
  The ground shook violently.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  Debris from the buildings covered the area on both sides.
 </p>
 <p>
  I ran forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  The collapsed roof of a building hit the spot where I had been standing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis stumbled, missing a step.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jenna, take care of the kid. Don’t leave her even if you die.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The rest, keep running!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s 5 minutes to the exit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa lightly jumped over the debris blocking the path ahead.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-6" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  Then I kicked off the wall and leaped over it. Jenna supported Priasis and followed. Velkist lifted Eolka, who was frantically running ahead.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Jedy (★★★)’ has returned to the goddess’s embrace! Her determination will forever be remembered.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is she dead already?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned left at the intersection.
 </p>
 <p>
  To the right again. The vibrations were becoming increasingly intense.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking back, some of the heroes with poor balance were stumbling. Beyond them, a lifeless body clung to the ground like gum. It seemed to be the deceased woman, maybe Jedy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Click.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Those with spare energy, support those who are struggling. It’ll be troublesome if anyone dies here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;I’ve already told you. H-how much longer to the exit?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Only one minute.”
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-7" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 </div>
 <p>
  I ended the communication.
 </p>
 <p>
  I continued forward, leaping over obstacles and pushing through them.
 </p>
 <p>
  The door leading outside was getting closer.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s fortunate there are no monsters.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In that case, the difficulty must have doubled.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ignoring the vibrations, I moved. My sense of balance had already transcended human limits. Strong tremors couldn’t knock me over. I passed by collapsing pillars on both sides.
 </p>
 <p>
  I stepped onto the desert outside the city.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t stop even if you’re outside of the city. Keep moving.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I glanced back briefly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Members of the raid were steadily exiting the city. The massive sand wave grazed the edge of their group. In an instant, the entire city was engulfed in sand.
 </p>

 <p>
  &lt;We’ve escaped for now. How far do we need to go?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Until I say stop. But you can slow down.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I slowed my pace.
 </p>
 <p>
  My clothes billowed, and sand poured off my body.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this because of me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis spoke in a stiff voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry about it. We’ll tire each other out if we start analyzing everything.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I took out a water pouch and took a sip.
 </p>
 <p>
  No one was injured. The other members of the 1st party were fine. Priasis was unharmed too. Somehow, we had escaped the city. The vibrations grew distant.
 </p>
 <p>
  After getting some distance from the city, I stopped.
 </p>
 <p>
  I immediately sent a stop signal through the communication. The movement of the entire raid came to a halt.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some heroes slumped down, perhaps exhausted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, we made it. It was a bit risky though.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna wiped the sweat from her forehead.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the city. Its shape was unrecognizable. It had become a mixture of sand and debris. However, the vibrations were still ongoing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oppa, why are you looking at it like that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What does it look like to you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I pointed at the city.
 </p>
 <p>
  The whole city was quaking.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh, so… an earthquake?”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Is there even an earthquake like this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I swallowed a bitter laugh.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘You really got me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked around.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some of them had relieved expressions as if their mission had been accomplished. I put my hand on my ear and opened a channel.
 </p>
 <p>
  “All units, get ready.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;The mission isn’t over?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s funny. This is just the beginning.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Small waves appeared across the entire desert.
 </p>
 <p>
  Every grain of sand beneath our feet trembled.

  “Grab your weapons. Be prepared.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What on earth…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The ground beneath us shook heavily.
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  [Constructing the field.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  A wall of flames rose on the outskirts of the desert.
 </p>
 <p>
  The flames formed a wide circle, enclosing us.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then…
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  I immediately looked at the city.
 </p>
 <p>
  Large and small buildings were bouncing like toys. From tens to hundreds of meters.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, sand rose like a mountain.
 </p>
 <p>
  10 meters.
 </p>
 <p>
  50 meters.
 </p>
 <p>
  100 meters…
 </p>
 <p>
  I stopped measuring at 300 meters.
 </p>
 <p>
  One thing was certain.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A gigantic monster.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Not just a few meters or tens of meters.
 </p>
 <p>
  I tried to estimate its size again.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was huge. Incredibly huge. Although the creature and I were nearly 100 meters apart, I could barely see its end without bending my neck.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ku-gu-gu-gu-gu-gung!
 </p>
 <p>
  An object presumed to be one of its legs moved.
 </p>
 <p>
  The estimated radius of one leg was over tens of meters. It was the size of a large building. A red light flashed from the creature’s head.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ancient Stone Statue Lv.???]
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled and said, “Do you usually dream of such things?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, no, I’ve never seen anything like this in my dreams…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Mission type has changed.]

  [Mission Type – Subjugation]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Objective – Exterminate the enemy!]

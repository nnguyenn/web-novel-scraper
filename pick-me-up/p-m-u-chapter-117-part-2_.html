 </p>
 <p>
  Outside of the desert.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lizardmen appeared beyond the flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  They bared their tongues and charged at us, their eyes gleaming red.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Pay attention.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Gulp.
 </p>
 <p>
  I heard someone swallowing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “2nd party, take the front. 4th and 5th parties, stay in the back. We protect the escort target. We also try to find a way to defeat the status stone. You take care of the lizardmen. Make sure they don’t reach the 1st party.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The stone statue….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you just keep your distance, you won’t be attacked.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The giant took his fifth step.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the distance closed, it became clear who it was targeting.
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis.
 </p>
 <p>
  It had its sights set on the owner of the key.
 </p>
 <p>
  Its direction matched Priasis’.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s easy to recognize.”

 </p>
 <p>
  [Lizardman Riders Lv.25] x 10
 </p>
 <p>
  [Lizardman Shamans Lv.26] x 2
 </p>
 <p>
  The second formation of lizardmen appeared to the west of the field.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hahaha! We’ll handle those guys!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha burst into hearty laughter and then bowed her body.
 </p>
 <p>
  The members of the 3rd party took the same stance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Papapapak!
 </p>

 <p>
  Five of them ran across the sand dunes, tearing their arms and legs.
 </p>
 <p>
  In an instant, they were far away.
 </p>
 <p>
  we agreed on not interfering with the 3rd party.
 </p>
 <p>
  They would perform their role. I gripped my sword tightly and said, “Let’s begin.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kiaaa!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The 4th and 5th parties fell back.
 </p>
 <p>
  2nd party, led by Edis, advanced.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Form a line!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Arrows shot out from Edis’s shortbow.
 </p>
 <p>
  The leading lizardman, riding a giant lizard, was knocked off course. However, they didn’t falter, their red eyes gleaming as they continued their charge. And they collided head-on with the 2nd party.

 <p>
  The clash of metal and the screams of lizardmen filled the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They’re coming here too. Get ready!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lycan drew his greatsword.
 </p>

 <p>

 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  This time from the south.
 </p>
 <p>
  The monster horde pierced through the flames and approached.

 <p>
  They immediately began their assault.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll move too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How do you plan to do that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll bait the creature’s attacks and find an opening.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The surroundings grew darker.
 </p>
 <p>
  The giant’s massive body blocked out the sunlight. Not far away, one of its massive legs creaked. I brought my hand to my ear. A click.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t get close to us. Keep your distance. We might get crushed if we get too close.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Alright.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Understood.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Yes!&gt;

 <p>
  The morale of the attack team is high.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kid, don’t lose focus.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, got it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Clunk.
 </p>
 <p>
  The statue came to a stop.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kikigigig.
 </p>
 <p>
  The creature’s shoulder and right arm moved.
 </p>
 <p>
  Slowly, it extended backward. The length seemed to be hundreds of meters. The large shadow of its arm was cast over the entire field. And then…
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s coming.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kikigigig.
 </p>

  Its fist began to descend.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no need to see the target.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Priasis!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Run!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The size of the fist easily exceeded the size of a sports field.
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis ran, waving her clothes. She had plenty of room. The fist was huge, but it wasn’t fast. It could be easily avoided. The problem was…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kiaaaargh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A lizardman that leaped over a sand dune.
 </p>
 <p>
  He rolled halfway and swung his sword. Immediately, Velkist leaped forward. With a swift movement, the sword tore the lizardman apart, splitting it in two.

 <p>
  “Krr, Krr! Kill him, kill him!”
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, five lizardmen appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Sorry, there are too many of them!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis’s desperate voice echoed in my ear.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s okay. Focus on your party. I expected this much.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Squish!
 </p>
 <p>
  One of them fired an arrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kang. I deflected it with the steel bracer on my elbow. At the same time, I threw a dagger. The lizardman with the blade in its eye immediately screamed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They can’t block them all.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The field was too wide.
 </p>
 <p>
  15 people couldn’t cover all directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some would break through our defenses or come around. Their goal was the same as the statue’s. The extermination of the key’s owner.
 </p>
 <p>
  “1st party, clear the way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna pulled out her bow with lightning speed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Papapapak! Four lizardmen that were charging were sent rolling down the hill. Blood oozed from where the arrows had pierced.

 </p>
 <p>
  A lizardman from the side thrust its spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  I swung my sword long. Swoosh. The blade sliced through everything in its path like tofu. Along with the spear, the upper and lower halves of the lizardman separated. Watery blood scattered in the sand. Then, I threw two daggers in succession. The daggers pierced the foreheads of two more lizardmen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whooooosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  A heavy pressure pressed down from above.
 </p>
 <p>
  The fist was getting closer. I retrieved the daggers as I passed by the lizardman’s corpse and jumped towards Priasis. I embraced Priasis’s waist and leaped straight ahead.

  “Ha, Han?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hold on tight.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The shadow on the ground grew darker.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Crack, click!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kwak!
 </p>
 <p>
  The explosion sent the lizardman’s body soaring high into the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was Eloka’s magic. I looked up. Something black was descending from the sky, obscuring the sun.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Get out of the area!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka and Jenna leaped to the left, while Neryssa and Velkist went to the right.
 </p>
 <p>
  With Priasis half lifted, I dashed forward. I put all my strength into my calves. Sand shot up as my body was propelled forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crash!
 </p>
 <p>
  The fist slammed down from behind.
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis, off balance, was about to be thrown off.
 </p>
 <p>
  I firmly held Priasis’s hand, burying Bifrost’s blade deep into the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What in the world…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis’s face turned pale.
 </p>
 <p>
  A massive crater appeared where the fist had struck.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s some power.”
 </p>
 <p>

 <p>
  [Lizardmen Lv.23] x 86
 </p>
 <p>
  I brushed the sand off my shoulder.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kikigigig. The statue’s fist, buried in the ground, trembled.

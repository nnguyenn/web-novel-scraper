 <p>
  Whenever the stone statue tried to pull out its fist, the ground shook.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sliding down the sand dune, I glanced at the monster’s arm. It looked like a giant bridge sticking vertically out of the ground. Lizardmen, caught in the shockwave, scattered around.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Crack!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I swung my arm without even looking.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud! A lizardman with an elbow to his face tumbled away. I immediately stabbed my sword into his torso.
 </p>
 <p>
  Squelch. Edis’s voice rang in my ears.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Han, are you okay?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, I’m fine.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;It was a surprise. Suddenly, the ground started shaking…&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can you handle the waves?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;We can for now, but if they keep coming like this, it’ll be tough.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  It was similar to the 20th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Endless waves of enemies. There was a limited amount of time we could hold out.
 </p>
 <p>
  We had to find a way within that time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kugugung.
 </p>
 <p>
  Leaving a crater behind, the stone statue’s fist began to rise in the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is the attack pattern always going to be this simple?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Shifting its weight by moving its feet, and hammering its fist down.
 </p>
 <p>
  So far, there have been only two actions. The range was enormous, and the lizardmen were constantly interfering, but the chances of getting hit all at once were low. I carefully examined the surface of the rising stone statue.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s made of solid rock. The surface is flat. There aren’t many places to grab onto, other than that I don’t see anything worth noting.’

 <p>
  I looked back.
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis and the remaining two members were standing firm.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll move too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  We immediately moved away.
 </p>
 <p>
  As we climbed the hill, I saw another party engaged in combat with the lizardmen. They were shoulder to shoulder, constantly repelling the incoming enemies.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are we going to do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s either go in or climb up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Look over there.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I pointed to the other side of the hill.

 <p>
  Eloka’s gaze followed my finger. Her eyes widened in surprise.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The flames are narrowing. We can’t hold out much longer. This place will soon turn into a sea of fire.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s only one place to escape.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But how do we climb up? It doesn’t look easy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the stone statue.
 </p>
 <p>
  Endless in size and height. The fist had risen to several hundred meters by now.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We have to find the right angle.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Angle?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “For now, we need to get away from it.”

 <p>
  Kiaaak.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lizardmen who had broken through the defensive line in the distance were charging towards us.
 </p>
 <p>
  I glanced at them and then turned. I ran towards the opposite side of the field.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is Party 1. I have a question. Is there a statue or something like a goddess nearby?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;A goddess statue? What are you talking about? We’re more concerned about the fire…&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Forget about that. Focus on the front.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;I don’t see anything like a goddess statue.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;A goddess statue? Are you talking about the weird-looking female statue with pieces missing? It’s buried in the sand next to a pile. That’s what you’re asking about, right warrior?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  It was Kishasha’s communication.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked to the west of the field.
 </p>

 <p>
  All three parties were engaged in a fierce battle with dozens of lizardmen. Their claws flashed, and with each swing of their legs, lizardmen’s limbs and torsos were torn apart and flew through the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  I concentrated my vision.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lizardmen’s corpses were piled up like small mountains next to it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Good.
 </p>
 <p>
  The stone statue was moving from behind.
 </p>
 <p>
  “From now on, run west into the desert. Run!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I put all my strength into my steps.
 </p>
 <p>
  My ankles sank into the sand, slowing me down. Still, I had to time it somehow.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna, running alongside me, spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oppa, what are you planning? Wouldn’t it be better to be near that monster if you want to avoid an attack? It might be easier to escape if we’re close!”
 </p>

 <p>
  “What? But…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Neryssa, take care of the kid.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa caught up with the lagging Priasis and increased her speed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist lowered his upper body and sprang forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lizardmen were attacking from the right. Velkist, who had drawn his sword quickly, cut down two lizardmen like sheaves of wheat. I glanced behind me and shouted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kid, take out the key.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis took out a dagger from her pocket.
 </p>
 <p>
  It didn’t shine. It was flashy, but it was still just an ordinary dagger.
 </p>

  “That’s enough. hide it for now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The first step was complete.
 </p>
 <p>
  Special items used for Pick Me Up missions are usually surrounded by light. The fact that the key didn’t react at all meant,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The key can’t be used yet.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was time to check the second item.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kishasha, it’s Han.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Yo, I’m in the middle of having fun!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The lizardman’s scream faintly reached me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sorry, but I have a request. Would you mind putting your hand on that goddess statue?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Sure thing.&gt;
 </p>

 <p>
  A moment later, her voice continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Warrior, it seems like nothing happened.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it. You guys get away from there. I’m bringing the statue with me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;What’s your intention?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m not sure.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright, we’ll follow you!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled and ended the communication.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha’s group, who had single-handedly slaughtered the lizardmen, was getting further away.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oppa, the monster is coming from behind!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I know.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The ground shook heavily.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the aftermath of the monster taking a step after a step.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  The field was narrowing due to the flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lizardmen kept appearing from nowhere and continued to swarm.
 </p>
 <p>

  “Fold the defense. Join me where I am.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned my head to the side.
 </p>
 <p>
  An arrow barely grazed my cheek.
 </p>
 <p>
  Splat! Jenna shot. A lizardman with a pierced head fell flat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “‘Annan (★★★)’ is in a bleeding state. Health decreases at regular intervals.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “‘Gilbert (★★★)’ has returned to the goddess’s embrace! His valor will be remembered forever.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They already reached their limit.’

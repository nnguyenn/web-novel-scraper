 <p>
  I looked down the hole.
 </p>
 <p>
  Beyond the ladder, the interior of the stone statue was vaguely visible.
 </p>

 <p>
  “I’ll go first!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha chuckled and approached the ladder.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took out a piece of paper from my pocket and handed it to Kishasha.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a map of the interior. Use it as a reference.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Warrior, you’re carrying something interesting. I’ll make good use of it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha casually accepted the paper.
 </p>
 <p>
  The paper had a map of the bonus stage drawn on it.
 </p>
 <p>
  From the wall material to the smell and structure, everything matched perfectly. There was no doubt about it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Everyone, get in, including Priasis.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Me too?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s safer inside than outside. You’ll understand when you see it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Creak.
 </p>
 <p>
  Far away, the lid opened again, and the lizardmen popped out.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Han, you go firs…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The order will be from the 2nd party to the 5th party.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Karrl!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The charging lizardman was hit by an arrow and stumbled.

  With a mournful scream, his shadow moved away into the flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The 1st party won’t go in. We’ll attack from the outside.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that okay?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled without saying a word.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was enough for Kishasha to understand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it, nehehe! I’m looking forward to it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Unique Skill, Transformation Activate!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Kishasha (★★★★)’ transforms!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Roar!
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha transformed into a giant tiger in an instant and roared.

 <p>
  Kishasha, without hesitation, bit onto Priasis and leaped into the hole. At the same time, the members of the 3rd party slid down.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Han, be careful.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis started descending the ladder after Kishasha.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thwack!
 </p>
 <p>
  The second ballista shot targeted Edis. I gripped my sword tightly with both hands and swung it vigorously. I briefly lost balance, but I could still deflect the arrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Lizardman Lv.25] X 37
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kruk, Karralak!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The lizardmen’s group got closer.
 </p>
 <p>
  Their eyes gleamed with determination. Eloka sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Our party always does the hard work.”

 </p>
 <p>
  “Climb up the arm and go all the way to the head. If you see any suspicious devices, destroy them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It sounds simple enough.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang.
 </p>
 <p>
  The rear hatch closed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Five people remained on the arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  The distinct odor of the lizardmen brushed past our noses. I raised my sword to the side.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Clear a path.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pipipip!

 <p>
  Three rapid shots flew at the frontmost monster in dazzling speed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist went left, I went center, and Neryssa went right. The three swords emitted simultaneous gleams.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kiaaah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The pierced and severed lizardmen bled profusely as they fell apart.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ignite!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Flames erupted from Eloka’s sleeves and shot outwards.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Explosion!]
 </p>
 <p>
  A loud explosion followed, and the shattered lizardman’s body soared into the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  The falling flames began to cling to the stone floor. I forcefully kicked the face of the lizardman who was gliding away. He crashed into a pile of flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll handle the ballista!”

  Crack!
 </p>
 <p>
  Pieces of the ballista arrow scattered.
 </p>
 <p>
  The third shot. The mechanical contraption continued its automatic reloading.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh, whoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  The lizardman with feathers on his back started swinging his staff in a frenzy.
 </p>
 <p>
  A red light gathered at the tip of his staff. Signs of an impending eruption. In an instant, Jenna, who had drawn her bow, took aim. The arrow pierced through two lizardmen’s torsos without losing its strength, hitting the mage’s forehead behind.
 </p>
 <p>
  Three in the front row, two in the rear. We advanced in a W formation, clearing the way.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Oh, there are a lot of strange devices here! I’ll break them all!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  The ground shook briefly as something broke.

  Faint smoke rose from the cracks of the statue.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Warning!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The ‘Self-Defense System’ of the statue is progressing to Level 2.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A mechanical device emerged from the arm’s side.
 </p>
 <p>
  It had a targeting scope and five arrows loaded, a rapid-fire ballista.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Eloka!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was prepared for this!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka gestured to the left.
 </p>
 <p>
  The flames spread rapidly and engulfed the ballista.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Explosion!]

  With a loud explosion, the shattered machine flew into the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nice.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist chuckled and swung his sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Lizardman caught in the path of the sword was torn horizontally. Nearby, Neryssa was puncturing holes in their torsos. I drew my sword in an arc from the center and split the Lizardman vertically.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kyrarara!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Lizardman Lv.27] X 41
 </p>
 <p>
  Somewhere, a passage opened, and the Lizardmen kept appearing.
 </p>
 <p>
  But they were just prey. We killed them and pushed them into corners as we advanced.
 </p>
 <p>
  【Push!】
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka clenched her fists.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dozens of Lizardmen were pushed back as if they had been struck by an invisible hammer. It was a simple pushing spell with no killing power, but there was a cliff on the side.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kiaaaah.
 </p>
 <p>
  The clustered Lizardmen fell down into the fiery zone below.
 </p>
 <p>
  After a long time, since we climbed the giant’s arm, we were already several meters above the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  Klirik.
 </p>
 <p>
  I forcefully lowered the aiming device of the ballista, which was trying to shoot arrows.
 </p>
 <p>
  The cleanly severed front part of the ballista flowed down diagonally.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kwak!
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;One more!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Thick smoke seeped through the cracks.
 </p>

  As the gap where the smoke was spreading widened, something huge popped out.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kraaaa!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ogre Lv.23]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s not your turn to come out.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Arrows pierced the same spot on its forehead three times in a row.
 </p>
 <p>
  I lowered my waist and put strength into my arms. Thud. I swung horizontally with force. The thick neck muscles of the Ogre were torn apart. The injured Ogre’s neck spewed blood profusely. I kicked it, and its rolling head fell downward.
 </p>
 <p>
  We reached the 5/2 mark.
 </p>
 <p>
  The incline of the giant’s arm became steeper. The light from the magic circle wrapped around the arm was fading.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dukung. The arm of the statue shook again.

  &lt;The third… Hm, what’s this?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s going on?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;The device escaped upwards.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “It escaped?”

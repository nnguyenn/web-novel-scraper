 <p>
  “Oppa!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna’s voice echoed from afar.

 <p>
  I looked up and shouted, “It’s okay, I’m not dead!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just wait a moment! I’m coming to rescue you now!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry! Head towards the head area! The crystals from earlier will keep coming out!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But Oppa…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve got this!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I surveyed the area.
 </p>
 <p>
  My current location was in the middle of the stone giant’s side.
 </p>
 <p>
  The creature’s arm was already raised.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s going to be tough.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I rummaged through the pouch on my belt with my left hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took out the cap of the heat-resistant potion and drank it. I also consumed a health potion and discarded the empty bottle.
 </p>
 <p>
  After taking a deep breath, I exerted strength on my arms and shoulders.
 </p>
 <p>
  I gained momentum like swinging on a swing. When I reached the highest point, I let go and leaped.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  I managed to land on the external passage on the surface of the abdomen.
 </p>
 <p>
  I reached out towards the sword embedded in the stone giant’s side.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Bifrost vibrated on its own and was pulled out from the surface.

 <p>
  The sword hilt, which had been floating in the air, flew towards me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I straightened the sword and ran towards the passage. The passage continued to the stairs leading upwards.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Fifth stage!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Ziing!
 </p>
 <p>
  I slid down as if on a slide.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hot steam was emitted from the gap just above.
 </p>
 <p>
  I got up and started running again.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kishasha, how far have we come?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;We’ve reached a big, circular room. There are strange mechanical devices here, and we’ve encountered golems too. We’ve smashed them though.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  I compared the map of the bonus stage and the shape of the stone giant in my head.

 <p>
  Our infiltration team’s current location seems to be in the abdomen of the stone giant.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;But there’s no way up. But the stairs keep coming.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re going up. Destroy everything as we descend.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Sounds good!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, the wall next to me rotated 180 degrees.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Lizardman Warrior Level 30]
 </p>
 <p>
  A lizardman warrior clad in thick scales twitched its tail.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kyrk, human! I, Korta, the top warrior of the lizardmen…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Get lost.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I brushed him aside as I passed.

 <p>
  Grrrr!
 </p>
 <p>
  The stone giant was moving its arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now that the ants have climbed on top, you’ll want to deal with them.
 </p>
 <p>
  I continued running up the stairs.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jenna!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oppa, where are you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m on my way up right now!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I heard the sound of swords clashing from the passage on my shoulder. Jenna seemed to be fighting lizardmen there.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Be careful of the stone giant’s arm!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I know!”
 </p>

 <p>
  As the wall rotated again, a lizardman emerged.
 </p>
 <p>
  I reached out with my left fist, struck his face, and pushed him aside.
 </p>
 <p>
  Beyond the falling lizardman, I saw the right arm of the stone giant rising. I stopped running and crouched down. I grabbed the protruding part.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  The passage shook violently.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like the stone giant had swung its arm downward.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you avoid it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “By the skin of my teeth!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The impact had caused part of the passage to collapse.
 </p>
 <p>
  I jumped over the collapsed section and continued forward.

 <p>
  From the belly to the chest, from the chest to the shoulder.
 </p>
 <p>
  I jumped over the bent railing twice and passed through three sections that were in ruins.
 </p>
 <p>
  The shoulder of the stone giant came into view. Above it, four people were gathered, fighting lizardmen. Jenna, who had just cut down one of them with her dagger, looked in my direction.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oppa!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I leaped over a 1-meter ledge and swung my sword upwards.
 </p>
 <p>
  The upper body of the lizardman was cleanly severed. As I severed the upper body, I drew my dagger and thrust it into one lizardman’s chest.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It took you long enough. We’ve been waiting.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist kicked aside a lizardman whose side was writhing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sploosh. The lizardman fell hundreds of meters below. The area around Velkist seemed to have been cleared roughly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t scare us like that. I thought you were dead!”

 <p>
  “You almost died yourself. Why are you complaining?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Whatever!”
 </p>
 <p>
  On the other side, the stone giant’s neck turned around with a creak.
 </p>
 <p>
  Its red gaze was fixed on us. Its mouth was tightly shut, whether out of anger or something else.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s the next move?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re going for its head.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sounds good.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Fifth stage! No, it’s going up this time too!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  A large crystal rose from the opposite shoulder.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was more than 100 meters away. I glanced at Eloka.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Leave it to me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka spun around once and then clasped her hands together.
 </p>
 <p>
  Threads of magic began to weave.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Warning!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The stone giant’s ‘self-defense system’ is now at level 4.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A large object resembling a tube rose near the stone giant’s neck, and the entrance opened.
 </p>
 <p>
  [X Magic Golem Lv. 35]
 </p>
 <p>
  Humanoid. About 2 meters in size.
 </p>
 <p>
  A sturdy rocky body with gears and mechanical devices peeking through the gaps.
 </p>
 <p>
  Its pair of lenses focused on our direction.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s that thing again?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What else could it be? Our prey.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  The creature charged towards us.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The ancient stone giant is casting a ‘beam from the mouth’!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The stone giant’s mouth opened slightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Zzzzing. A blue light began to gather.
 </p>
 <p>
  Its target was Eloka, who was casting a spell.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just cancel the spell…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t interrupt me.”

 <p>
  There was no time to waste.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had to enter the upper body of the stone giant as quickly as possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang!
 </p>
 <p>
  Blades protruded from both of the Magic Golem’s hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  I stepped forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  The golem crossed its arms, and dozens of blades were shot from all directions. I twisted my extended forelimb and swung my sword in a circle. The blades entangled like fish caught in a net.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sck!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang!
 </p>
 <p>
  As I swung forcefully, the blades broke simultaneously.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thuduk. I turned my left hand into a hook and inserted it into the golem’s joint gap.
 </p>

 <p>
  I knew the position.
 </p>
 <p>
  I ripped out the red wires.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the opposite side, are blue wires. Below the abdomen, a gear-shaped like a clock. I clenched my fist. The machine components hanging loosely fell off one by one.
 </p>
 <p>
  Zing.
 </p>
 <p>
  The golem came to a halt.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s dangerous, it’s charging!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I knocked over the golem that was standing tall.
 </p>
 <p>
  The machinery collapsed. The beam was about to be emitted from the front. The blue light grew stronger. I clenched Bifrost in my right hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s do it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [Weapon Awakening!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Bifrost gains a special power.]

  [Bifrost gains a special power.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A radiant dark glow began to swirl around the sword’s blade.
 </p>
 <p>
  I held the sword in front of me to shield my body. The stone giant’s mouth opened wide, and a massive blue beam shot out. I bent my knees, holding the hilt with both hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  The beam collided head-on with the sword’s edge.
 </p>
 <p>
  Everything flashed before my eyes. A heavy impact, as if colliding with a train head-on. Rrrrrrr. It was the sound of friction with the ground as my body was pushed back uncontrollably.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No matter how much of an oppa you are, that’s too reckless…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Keeiiik!
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned my heels to the side.
 </p>
 <p>
  My body, which had been pushed back, came to a stop.
 </p>
 <p>
  I swung the sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ttwak!
 </p>
 <p>
  The blue beam that had flown in the opposite direction slammed into the stone giant’s mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  An explosion followed the impact.
 </p>
 <p>
  I relaxed my stance and extended the sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was a hole pierced through the stone giant’s mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thick smoke billowed out of the hole.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where do you get that sword? I want one too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s only one. Can’t help you.”

  [Draste Seducio. Fire away!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The flames swirling around Eloka’s body soared into the air and were launched.
 </p>
 <p>
  The target was the crystal on the opposite side. When the flame turned into a spear, the crystal exploded and oxidized. It was a combination of telekinesis and flame magic.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka approached me and lowered her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You really are reckless. Even a hundred lives wouldn’t be enough for you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll talk later. Run.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Through that hole, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I kicked aside the remains of the collapsed golem and jumped.
 </p>
 <p>
  The palm behind us was moving towards us like a broom sweeping the floor.

 <p>
  Grrrrrrr!
 </p>
 <p>
  Thunk. Thunk.
 </p>
 <p>
  The shoulders swayed from side to side. It seemed like the creature was shaking its body.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kyrk, Kararalak! Block them!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A long tube rose near the neck.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Lizardman Warrior Lv. 28] X 5
 </p>
 <p>
  Clunk.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Krugh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as they appeared, one of them slipped and fell to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Leave those guys to me.”

 <p>
  “This isn’t fun at all.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa and Velkist jumped ahead.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka, who was running behind with her dress fluttering, took out a mana potion and drank it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna drew her bow while running. Ping! An arrow shot out and struck one lizardman in the nose.
 </p>
 <p>
  The chambers continued to rise.
 </p>
 <p>
  The surface of the chamber had a gear pattern drawn on it.
 </p>
 <p>
  The chamber’s door opened.
 </p>
 <p>
  [X Magic Golem Lv. 33]
 </p>
 <p>
  This golem was equipped with rapid-fire crossbows on both arms.
 </p>
 <p>
  The crossbow’s targeting mechanism turned towards us and began to rotate like a Gatling gun.
 </p>

 <p>
  Kwa-chik!
 </p>
 <p>
  Arrows fired from the longbow pierced through both arms in succession. Jenna, lightning-fast, drew her dagger.
 </p>
 <p>
  “On the shoulders, the sides, and inside the abdomen!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssugak, ssugak-ssugak!
 </p>
 <p>
  Dismantled wires and mechanical devices sprang out from the golem’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  The golem toppled sideways. Jenna looked at me and grinned.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehe, this is how it’s done, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stop showing off and run.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The stone giant’s hand, covering its shoulders, was getting closer, smashing everything in its path.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Krrak!”

  The last remaining lizardman was taken care of.
 </p>
 <p>
  Two of them stuck close together.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Sixth round!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Chiiiik!
 </p>
 <p>
  Steam billowed from various parts of the status’ body.
 </p>
 <p>
  The emission rate had increased significantly. Even a slight touch would turn you into smoked meat. We bypassed the rising steam as we ran.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How it’s going?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Resistance is quite intense! Naha, but we can’t stop it. We’re taking them all down!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are the escorts unharmed?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;You’re asking too much. Of course!&gt;

  “You’re about to reach a dead end. Get ready to escape. I’ve marked a way out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I cut off the communication.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m going in!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna jumped up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her small body was sucked into the stone giant’s neck hole. Next up was Eloka. Then it was Velkist and Neryssa.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked ahead.
 </p>
 <p>
  With one of its lenses broken and holes in its mouth, the stone giant’s face was staring at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I laughed and raised my middle finger towards it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then I jumped.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sliding down the corridor like a slide, into the darkness.

 <p>
  Suddenly, a floating sensation approached.
 </p>
 <p>
  I adjusted my posture and rotated my body.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud! I landed with a parachute landing technique.
 </p>
 <p>
  A circular room the size of a sports field.
 </p>
 <p>
  Both the walls and floor were made of black metal.
 </p>
 <p>
  Red fluorescent lights were blinking on the ceiling. Blinking.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s an interesting place.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna reached down to touch the floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Warning!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The stone giant’s ‘self-defense system’ is now in its final stage.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Wee-iiing! Wee-iiing! Wee-iiing!
 </p>
 <p>
  Sirens began to blare loudly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna yanked her hand back in surprise.
 </p>
 <p>
  “W-what’s going on? Did I touch something by mistake?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t panic. It’s not your fault.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I quickly surveyed the area.
 </p>
 <p>
  Beyond the railing on the floor, we stood on, a steam engine-like contraption moved up and down busily. Next to it, a large iron door was noticeable. The door was slightly ajar.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kark, kark. Foolish warriors, welcome to the Chamber of Trials!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A scratching sound came from the ceiling speaker.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hahaha, taste my masterpiece that I’ve spent my whole life creating!”

 </p>
 <p>
  From blade golems to crossbow golems and even axe golems.
 </p>
 <p>
  Three golems in total appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  They stood facing each other, eyeing each other warily.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s…”

  &lt;Clang! There are no weaknesses in my invention!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  [XYZ Ultimate Magic Golem Lv. 46]
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang.
 </p>
 <p>
  Size, about 5 meters.
 </p>
 <p>
  Four legs spread out in a square, with two arms.
 </p>
 <p>
  Weapons were attached all over its body. The seams that had been exposed were all filled with metal plates.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s its weakness?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m not sure.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Giririk.
 </p>
 <p>
  Its four feet moved slowly forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the same time, the exit began to close.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Hahaha! Kneel before my greatness!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  I detached the scabbard from my belt and kicked it towards the floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sliding across the floor, the scabbard blocked the gap in the door.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;What kind of trick is this? It’s amusing. Pathetic objects like that can be crushed in an instant… Huh?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Girik, thud.
 </p>
 <p>
  The door moved several times, trying to break the scabbard.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the scabbard didn’t have a single scratch.
 </p>
 <p>
  I ran towards the exit.
 </p>
 <p>
  I inserted my fingers into the gap and pushed to the side. Squeak!
 </p>
 <p>
  The door swung wide open.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Pass through.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thanks for the show!”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Hey, wait up! Hey!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna, Eloka, Velkist, and Neryssa exited through the corridor.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked back. The four-legged magic golem was stumbling towards me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll meet soon, so wash your neck and wait.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I retrieved the scabbard.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  The door closed, leaving the golem behind.
 </p>
 <p>
  I continued down the corridor. The red lights were blinking along with the sirens. The end of the mission was in sight.

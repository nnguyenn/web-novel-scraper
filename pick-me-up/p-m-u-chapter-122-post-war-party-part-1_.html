 <p>
  Two days later in the evening, a party was taking place on the second floor of the waiting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  They cleared a space in the corner of the square, and set up tables and chairs next to the fountain. On the tables, dishes prepared by the waiting room chefs showcased their culinary skills.

 <p>
  “Hahaha, there’s no place like this!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Raiman sat on the fountain edge, gulping down his beer.
 </p>
 <p>
  “When I first came, I thought it was some kind of hell, but now it’s not bad. It’s no different from being a mercenary. Don’t you think so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right. Whether there or here, people are dying all the same.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The fourth party sitting on the bench drank together.
 </p>
 <p>
  On one side of the square, a large keg was placed, a special import that Anytng had brought from the gift shop.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a disgusting, tsk tsk.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eolka raised her head from the corner, holding a chicken skewer in her hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you don’t indulge in feasting while alive, when will you? This is also a luxury.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “True words. It’s better than dying.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis raised her glass.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lilinia, standing nearby, shrank back.
 </p>
 <p>
  “A lot of people died….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s unfortunate, but if we stop, we can’t move forward. We survived. While we mourn the dead, we should also be happy for our survival. That’s the mercenary life.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “….Is that so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The second party was enjoying their meal at the left table of the square.
 </p>
 <p>
  “When will it end? I want to go back to the training camp.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist complained, leaning against the wall. Neryssa was beside him.

  “We prepared so much… Is it not to your taste?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Chloe, carrying plates with an apron tied around her, approached.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not that it doesn’t taste good. It’s just…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He’s embarrassed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you want to die?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The two of them started bickering as always.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sat in the corner and handed out drinks.
 </p>
 <p>
  Post-war party.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was an event that I didn’t overlook in Niflheimr. To recover from the fatigue of battle and recharge morale. The scale might not be as large as back then, but the effect would be sufficient.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He’s doing his part now too.’

  Beyond the glass ceiling, the sky was shining.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were still many shortcomings, but he had improved from before.
 </p>
 <p>
  “By the way, isn’t the star of this party you, hyng? What were you doing before coming here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve been farming.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hahaha! What an amusing joke!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I placed an empty cup on the table.
 </p>
 <p>
  About 30 people participated. Not only combatants but also others from the support team. The third party of the beastfolks said they would stay in their own areas, though.
 </p>
 <p>
  Laughter erupted from various places.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna, mixed with a group of women, was leading the conversation. My name seemed to be vaguely heard.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s awkward.’

 <p>
  I know it’s necessary.
 </p>
 <p>
  It just felt like wearing clothes that didn’t suit me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist and Neryssa were here too.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like I couldn’t escape.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Um, excuse me…”
 </p>
 <p>
  A girl who had slipped away from Jenna approached me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm?”
 </p>
 <p>
  A girl with a fresh impression bowed to me with her hands clasped.
 </p>
 <p>
  Far away, Jenna was laughing. I don’t know what kind of joke it was.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I came here about a month ago…”

  [This is a jackpot event!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kyaa!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle suddenly popped out.
 </p>
 <p>
  The girl half fell and quickly ran away.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Han! Han! Han!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s going on? Get a hold of yourself. Call my name only once.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [More importantly, I have something to say!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle grabbed the collar of my clothes urgently.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed quite urgent.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s the matter? Fairy? Are we going into battle again?”

  [Hmph, focus on your alcohol. You Addicts! If it weren’t for Han, you wouldn’t be fooling around… Uwaaah!]
 </p>
 <p>
  I smacked her.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle floated in the air and spun half a circle.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Be back in a moment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I grabbed Iselle’s wings and entered the training camp.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ayayaya, that’s a sensitive area! Be a bit gentle…]
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Noisy.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I closed the door.
 </p>
 <p>
  The lights in the training camp were off.

  I unfolded a folding metal chair in the training camp and sat down.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, what’s the matter? Why all the fuss?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hoho, you’ll be surprised if you see!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle chuckled and waved her index finger from side to side.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, in mid-air, she spun around once, swirling both hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Fairy power!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Ding.
 </p>
 <p>
  Along with a lively sound effect, a hologram appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a familiar inscription.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pick Me Up’s official cafe.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-12" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  Iselle, with a triumphant expression, pointed to the top of the cafe with a small stick.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Hot Topics&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;1. Walkthrough video of my hero on the 30th floor.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;2. Reflections on the game of luck and nonsense&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;3. Can’t you manage the server properly?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The end of the stick points to the number ‘1’ among the hot topics.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like she was waiting for me to say something.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, he uploaded a video.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right!”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Iselle poked the topic with the stick, the screen changed.
 </p>
 <p>

 <p>
  &lt;Walkthrough video of my hero on the 30th floor.&gt;

  [A user who posted a question before.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Last time, I received a lot of help. Thanks to that, I was able to get answers. I’m uploading a walkthrough video at the request of someone. The hero in the video, named Han, is a 1-star born from the tutorial…]
 </p>
 <p>
  A video is attached.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I touched the triangle button, an advertisement played, followed by the video starting.
 </p>
 <p>
  A somewhat unrealistic game graphic of a desert field.
 </p>
 <p>
  A hero with black hair was running through the desert.
 </p>
 <p>
  The hero progressed steadily through the walkthrough, leading his companions.

  Fighting monsters and struggling on the giant’s arm. Inside the statue, he led the mission to success with a splendid performance.

  “It’s been taken care of. There shouldn’t be a need for your help. Just wait for 10 minutes and then go back and get some sleep. Don’t wait for us.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;What are you talking about? What do you mean don’t wait for us?&gt;

 <p>
  I cut off communication.
 </p>
 <p>
  I pressed various buttons on the device panel.

 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s useless.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The only thing that seems to work is immediate departure and descending the stairs.
 </p>
 <p>
  I tied up the unconscious guy with a rope and dragged him. The guy lying below was the same. After going down the corridor, I moved him inside. I wiped away the bloodstains with a mop.

  They’re picking out the expensive stuff.

 <p>
  A little while later,
 </p>
 <p>
  Creak. Creak.

 <p>
  In the distance, the sound of wagon wheels could be heard.
 </p>
 <p>
  I hid behind the pillar on the deck. When I peered through the railing, the guys were returning, pulling a cart full of boxes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Another fruitful day.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “At this rate, we can get some booze and women!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehe, not a single mouse in sight. There’s no sucker like this sucker.”
 </p>
 <p>
  They walked up with faces flushed with excitement.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey bro, we… Huh? Where did he go?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He’s probably gone in and fallen asleep already, right? We asked him to watch it! Ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The stairs have already been descended.
 </p>
 <p>
  The guys put the cart in the lower storage area and came up to the deck. As if it were waiting, the airship started moving.

  “Today’s departure is a bit early, isn’t it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  One of them expressed doubt, but,
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s there to know? It’s good to go quickly!”
 </p>
 <p>
  It was naturally buried.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took a deep breath.
 </p>
 <p>
  The airship started heading towards the whirlpool of dimensions.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Danger!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The airship ‘Capitalism Ho’ has departed with the Master’s items!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The system message blinked red, but Anytng had already left the game. After reconnecting, he would be able to see the log.

 <p>
  A strong pressure enveloped my entire body, and the background changed instantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  A gray sky and desolate land. It was the exterior of the tower.
 </p>
 <p>
  The airship spread its wings and swiftly soared into the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  About ten minutes passed like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Dimensional Leap Initiated!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The mechanical voice echoed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The scenery changed once again. Below the ground, countless typhoons were raging.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dimension 3847 – Harlara]
 </p>
 <p>
  A few hundred meters ahead, the whirlpool of dimensions was spinning.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the destination of the airship.

 <p>
  I stuck my head out of the pillar.
 </p>
 <p>
  I checked the deck. One person was leaning against the railing.
 </p>
 <p>
  The other four were not visible inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This should be enough.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I stood up and moved forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  The man leaning on the railing muttered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “In the past, the Master wasn’t like this. The world has changed. Isn’t that so… huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  I kicked the man’s back.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait, just a moment, ugh!”

 <p>
  The man’s overturned body continued to fall endlessly.
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned around and walked to the door inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  I opened the door.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A guy covered in blood rushed out.
 </p>
 <p>
  blood was leaking from his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re so weak. How can you be so weak?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist muttered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did we really have to hide in the chest? I thought I was going to die of suffocation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s the situation?”

  “This guy is the last one.”

  Velkist pointed his sword at the man.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait, spare me. Spare me, please. If you kill me, there will be retaliation. I don’t want to die!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thwack!
 </p>
 <p>
  The sword pierced the man’s shoulder and stuck into the deck.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ughhh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The man’s eyes rolled back, and he trembled violently.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist spat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You filthy bug.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This side is also cleared.”

 <p>
  Jenna came out onto the deck.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her dagger was soaked in blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They were worse than I thought. They said they had done this countless times.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even though we were on high alert because they invaded, this is… disappointing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka and Neryssa as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  All members of Party 1 gathered on the deck.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oppa, are we doing the same to them? There are only five of us. Is it okay?”
 </p>
 <p>
  It deviated slightly from the original plan.
 </p>
 <p>
  The original plan was to suppress the airship from the inside and then counterattack with an elite team. However, because it was on automatic mode, there was no room to carry members from another party.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There must be at least dozens of people in the enemy territory. After interrogating them, they said they could make it return to the waiting room if they adjusted the airship properly. After going back and reorganizing…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, it won’t work. There’s no meaning in a surprise attack.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I shook my head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If we’re late coming back, they’ll notice us too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We go like this. And finish it in one go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A slight blow won’t stop a hunter.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead, it will only provoke them. It doesn’t matter if they are strong or weak. If such a guy sticks to you, he will even interfere with the mission. There’s only one way.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But there are only five of us…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s enough.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist interrupted and kicked the man at his feet.

  “These kinds of bugs can be finished off in batches.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They are indeed weak.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the man.
 </p>
 <p>
  The reason he’s weak compared to his level is simple. He didn’t train properly.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he had given up on climbing the tower, there was no need to become as strong as we did.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The decision?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I reached for my pouch.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ve come this far, are we going back empty-handed?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s the obvious answer.”
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s no turning back now.

 <p>
  “Plunder everything and set it all on fire. Dry up their resources.”
 </p>
 <p>
  There is one rule that I learned about hunters while running Niflheimr.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Chase them to the end. Until they fold.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The dimensional rift was swallowing the airship.

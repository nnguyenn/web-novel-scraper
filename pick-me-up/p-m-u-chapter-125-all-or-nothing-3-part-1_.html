  As I moved towards the waiting room, I explained the plan to the members.
 </p>
 <p>
  “In a surprise attack, time is life. If we hesitate, the enemy’s forces will surround us, and with our numbers, we’ll be wiped out.”

  “Eloka, you’re crucial here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it. I’ll show you my….”
 </p>
 <p>
  I interrupted her.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Move swiftly. Make sure no one is left behind.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We will be okay, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I drew my sword fully.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll have to let them know the cost of messing with us.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A bright light enveloped me.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the signal for dimensional teleportation.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Permission to view system logs has been revoked.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Within the radiant light, Bifrost glowed black.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm?”
 </p>
 <p>
  When I opened my eyes again, the sword had returned to its original state.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Access to the log, I see.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It means you can access the system from other waiting rooms too.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Airship ‘Capitalist Ship’ has returned.]

 </p>
 <p>
  I looked up. The sky was shining brightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I see you’re watching.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s a good situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This time it’s quite fast! Did you catch anything useful?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Two men were approaching the entrance of the airship.
 </p>
 <p>
  Click. Creak. The stairs descended.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a rare case. At this rate, even the Master…”

 <p>
  Two arrows flew from the gap in the railing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Argh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I swung my sword as I descended the stairs.
 </p>
 <p>
  The two men fell to the ground, bleeding.

 <p>
  I kicked the bodies of the two guys.
 </p>
 <p>
  Their bodies turned into light and disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There are only two here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked around.
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t see the others in the dimensional rift. It’s better if they’re scattered. I decided to clean them up one by one.

  With a loud siren, the sky began to turn red.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems like we’ve been discovered?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now it begins.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I quickly headed towards the exit.

  Turning right in the corridor, a large square appeared.

 <p>
  Sixteen men. They each drew their weapons.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Neryssa.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa threw the round container she was holding.
 </p>
 <p>
  Drip, drip. A viscous liquid spilled out of the open lid.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you’re drunk, you need some fun. Do you like fireworks?”

  Eloka ignited the fire with a puff of breath.
 </p>
 <p>
  I received the burning firewood. The liquid inside the container was the airship’s fuel, in other words, oil. I brought a few barrels from the ship’s warehouse.
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled and enjoyed the fireworks.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The flames spread rapidly.
 </p>

 <p>
  I ran forward and shouted,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kill them all.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna’s arrow shot out like lightning.
 </p>
 <p>
  An arrow struck the head of one of the guys who was rolling on the ground, still on fire. Velkist then drew his sword, and the two men’s necks floated in the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Neryssa, Eloka, follow me!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the flames spread, a noxious smoke filled the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  I ran forward, flames still clinging to my body. The target was the entrance to the dormitory. Beyond the closed door, there were busy footsteps and shouts.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘We need to act before they regain their focus.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I’m going to finish this.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang! I kicked the door open.
 </p>
 <p>
  The attention of the heroes who were busy preparing for battle turned to us all at once.
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa rolled the second fuel barrel.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Strike.”

  “Fire, it’s fire!”

  “It’s one of the two. Either we do it, or it’s done to us.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The guys inside the dormitory went into a frenzy, shouting and causing chaos.
 </p>
 <p>
  This couldn’t be called a battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  Messages indicating the state of panic, despair, and fear of the heroes kept popping up one after another.
 </p>
 <p>
  If they had given it their all, we would have had to prepare for sacrifices as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  But we won’t give them the chance to do that.
 </p>
 <p>
  When the opponent is careless, asleep, or hasn’t gathered yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘We seize the advantageous situation.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I kicked the dormitory entrance with my foot.
 </p>
 <p>
  A transparent barrier blocked the way. Even intruders couldn’t enter the dormitory. It was the only facility that protected the heroes’ safety.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It doesn’t matter.’
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s a lot to do.
 </p>
 <p>
  Without hesitation, I turned my back.
 </p>
 <p>
  The 13 enemies who were already in the square had all turned into corpses, scattered around. Flames and fire rose fiercely all over the square.
 </p>
 <p>
  “To the 1st floor.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I descended the stairs.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ten heroes were waiting.
 </p>
 <p>
  The black-haired woman at the front drew her sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  “These bastards! You won’t take a single step from here!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Similar (★★★★)’ is gathering reinforcements!]

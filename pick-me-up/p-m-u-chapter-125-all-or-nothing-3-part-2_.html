 <p>
  I descended the stairs.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ten heroes were waiting.

  The black-haired woman at the front drew her sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  “These bastards! You won’t take a single step from here!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Similar (★★★★)’ is gathering reinforcements!]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They’re quick to respond.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I thought they hadn’t gathered yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned around and stepped onto the stairs leading to the 2nd floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You bastards! Are you running away?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come to think of it, we didn’t start a fire in the warehouse.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What… what?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re going to set it on fire now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You lunatic!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I quickly climbed the stairs.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No need to fight.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As long as they keep chasing us around, that’s enough.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the torch in my left hand, I walked to the right side of the square.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I opened the door, the inside was filled with shelves. It was a warehouse.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A young girl rushed at me with a frying pan in her hand.

  As I brushed past her, she fell down.

  ‘Is she the warehouse manager?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Unfortunately, there’s no room for mercy.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Roll it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa rolled the fuel canister.

  I dropped the torch.

  Intense flames erupted inside the warehouse.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the goal was item looting, sabotaging would be a foolish move, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘My goal isn’t that.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I left the warehouse.
 </p>
 <p>
  The square was already engulfed in flames. Smoke and flames filled the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The fool hasn’t customized the facilities.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The warehouse was in its default location, just like the dormitory.

  “Yes.”

  Velkist chuckled.

 <p>
  His left cheek was stained with ashes and blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Cough! Cough, cough!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Coughing followed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The 2nd-floor square had already turned into a hell of flames. We could withstand it, having steadily acquired flame resistance, but it would be different for them.

 <p>
  I went down to the first floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some of them resisted passively, but the main power had already been wiped out.
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s no fight left.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oppa, isn’t this enough? It’s almost halfway destroyed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna wiped her cheek.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was blood and ash on her fingers.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There are some bad guys, but there are also innocent people.”

 <p>
  “But it’s not over yet.”

  “But…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry. We won’t kill anymore. We’ll just destroy the basic facilities.”
 </p>
 <p>
  There are four core facilities that are necessary for every waiting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  The dormitory, warehouse, workshop, and training ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll burn them all down.”
 </p>
 <p>
  To make sure they can’t be restored.
 </p>
 <p>
  I opened the door to the first-floor warehouse. I poured oil straight in and set it on fire.
 </p>
 <p>
  [A fire has broken out in the 1st-floor warehouse… ]
 </p>
 <p>
  Messages about fires and damage kept popping up.
 </p>
 <p>
  We split into two teams and set fire to various buildings and destroyed the facilities. The defense forces disappeared. They may have had more numbers than us, but in an unorganized situation, they were just scarecrows.

 <p>
  [Master, 74 unread channel chats have been detected.]

  [Do you want to check?]

 <p>
  A log appeared on the left side of my field of vision.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed that Iselle’s master authority hadn’t disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Go away.’

  The notification window closed.
 </p>

  I started calculating the damage he suffered this time.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Main forces casualties. Loss of items and equipment. The storage completely burned down. The warehouse completely burned down. The plaza completely burned down. The dormitory partially destroyed. Equipment workshop inoperable.”

 <p>
  This won’t do.
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s one left. I asked the others to take care of the aftermath and went up to the second-floor plaza. The fire had somehow been extinguished. But almost everything, including benches and fountains, had turned into ashes.
 </p>
 <p>
  I opened the door on the opposite side of the dimensional rift.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the training ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Eek!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As I looked in the corner, several people were huddled together, trembling.
 </p>
 <p>
  Faces full of fear. Some were even crying.
 </p>
 <p>
  I approached them slowly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stay where you are!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A young man stood up.

 <p>
  “Where’s the Mage?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He’s over there.”

 <p>
  The young man politely pointed to the left door.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I approached that door.
 </p>
 <p>
  It didn’t seem like he had escaped anywhere in particular. It was the door to the Magic Hall.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as I was about to grab the doorknob…
 </p>
 <p>
  [I absolutely refuse to allow that!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  Something appeared in front of me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Two pairs of transparent wings.
 </p>
 <p>
  Petite facial features and a petite body. It was Iselle.
 </p>
 <p>
  The only difference was that she wore a red leather outfit instead of a black dress and had a pirate hat and eyepatch.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Move aside.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [No, I won’t, even if I die!]
 </p>
 <p>
  I grabbed the fairy’s wings and tossed her aside.
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you take that guy away… how will I survive… my dream of becoming the king of pirates… ughhh!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The fairy sat down on the ground and burst into tears.
 </p>
 <p>
  I stopped walking. She glanced at me for a moment and started muttering.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Half a year of suffering under a lousy master. I barely made it here. But now, this is how it ends. Don’t you think I’m pitiful?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “… “
 </p>
 <p>
  I opened the door.
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the Magic Hall, there was a faint smell of chemicals.
 </p>
 <p>
  On a messy desk against the wall, a young boy in a white robe was sleeping soundly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Sleeping through all this chaos.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A Mage.
 </p>
 <p>
  An essential talent that should not be missed in airship operations.
 </p>
 <p>
  I approached the boy from behind and tapped his shoulder.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Umm, who woke me up from my nap…? I’ve been working three days and nights due to overtime… ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I covered the boy’s mouth and pulled out a rope.
 </p>
 <p>
  In an instant, I tied up his arms, legs, and torso, and gagged his mouth with a rope.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!”

  “Don’t be so whiny. I’m starting to want to kill you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist spoke irritably.

 <p>
  ‘This guy really has no remorse.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Anyway.
 </p>
 <p>
  The boy entered the control room, went to the instrument panel, and started muttering.
 </p>
 <p>
  I watched the scene from behind. Velkist was ready to draw his sword at any moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If he had been there, things might have been different.’
 </p>
 <p>
  They wouldn’t have been defeated so easily.
 </p>
 <p>
  The true power of a Mage was revealed in various auxiliary spells. Surely, among them, there was a magic that could extinguish flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  I remembered his mumbling.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had stayed up for three days and nights. It was the Master’s responsibility for not managing his condition.
 </p>
 <p>
  Giiing.
 </p>
 <p>
  A hologram appeared on the instrument panel.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Capitalism!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Access has been granted.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right. Good job.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now you’re going to free me, right? Let me go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you talking about? You’re coming with us.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What, what?”
 </p>

  I pushed the boy aside and stood in front of the instrument panel.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Tie him up again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, you… Ugh! Ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist tied up the boy again and took him away.
 </p>
 <p>
  I examined the hologram. It was full of strange symbols and unknown language, but I could recognize the words ‘start’ and ‘departure.’ Push.
 </p>
 <p>
  Giiing!
 </p>
 <p>
  Capitalism started vibrating lightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ignition was successful. I walked out onto the deck.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Everyone get on board!”
 </p>

 <p>
  “We’re all loaded up. We’ll be there soon!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna and Neryssa climbed up the stairs.
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as the two of them set foot on the deck, the stairs automatically folded and retracted.
 </p>
 <p>
  [They’re taking everything for real! Everything! You bastards!]
 </p>
 <p>
  On the airport floor, a fairy was sobbing and hitting the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  [We were just trying to say hello, seriously?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this how you greet people in your world?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Did you expect to get away with this? Do you even know who’s behind us?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who’s behind you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’d be surprised if you heard. It’s the famous Union Guild! Composed of 30 rankers, it’s an elite guild! This master maybe trash in terms of skill, but they have connections there!]

  ‘What’s that?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Nonsense, really.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anyway, she said the master is connected with rankers.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had made an airship out of nothing and operated the waiting room. It was quite lacking for that type.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud.
 </p>
 <p>
  Capitalism shook heavily and began to move slowly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The direction was forward. It was where the whirlpool of dimensions raged.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What time is it now? I feel like I’ve been up all night.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna on the deck muttered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you’re sleepy, go inside and rest. I’m fine on my own.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Can I?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna yawned and went inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist went inside while still tying up the boy, and the others did the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was left alone on the deck.
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the airport, the fairy was glaring in this direction.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Enjoy your victory for now. But when the time comes, remember that even if you beg, it’ll be in vain! I’m a fairy who knows no mercy in front of enemies.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “….”
 </p>
 <p>
  [If this is also part of the process to become a pirate king, I’ll accept it with a smile. Trials are often part of the epic of a great person. My name is Captain Iselle, don’t forget and remember it!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [What’s your name!]

  I was about to answer Han, but I stopped myself.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hmm. Some mischievousness came into play.
 </p>
 <p>
  “My name.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Remember it.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “My name is Loki.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Pft!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Captain Iselle snorted.
 </p>
 <p>
  [No way, that Niflheimr…”]
 </p>
 <p>
  The fairy’s face turned red, and she exploded in anger.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You little shit, are you making up nonsense! Do you want to be scolded, huh?]

  I didn’t respond.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, I didn’t think she would believe it.
 </p>
 <p>
  At this stage, it wouldn’t be possible to know.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Don’t forget, I’ll definitely get my revenge!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The fairy leaped wildly.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the whirlpool engulfed Capitalism.

  [Intermediate Souls… ]
 </p>
 <p>
  [300,000… ]
 </p>
 <p>
  A list of items was displayed.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was such a massive amount that it was hard to read them all.
 </p>
 <p>
  I did what I could. I destroyed his waiting room as much as I could.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Revenge, huh.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Such a troublesome word.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because of this, I got caught up in numerous conflicts.
 </p>
 <p>
  I just wanted to quietly conquer the tower.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ve gone this far because I didn’t want us to get caught up in such a mess.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, an unidentified channel chat (114 messages) has been detected.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Would you like to check it?]

  Anytng would be surprised if he saw this, but I don’t have any other options.
 </p>
 <p>
  All I can do is recommend reporting and blocking.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the scenery outside the railing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Capitalism was sailing through the stormy sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Master, are you enjoying yourself?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, a voice echoed in my head.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet Seed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Were you watching?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Forgive my rudeness. There were so many memorable scenes I couldn’t miss. My album of memories just gained another page. My name. My name is Loki…&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t. It’s embarrassing.”

 <p>
  I replied.
 </p>
 <p>
  “By the way, what do you know about the Union Guild?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;I’ve never heard of it before either. I’ll investigate.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet responded.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Just give me the order. After identifying the Union Guild’s base, I will annihilate it. It’s been a long time since the fleet set out, and everyone is itching to move.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “No need for that. Leave it alone. That if they don’t provoke us first.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;And if they provoke us…&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then leave it to your judgment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I heard a faint laugh.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;It’s exciting.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The communication was cut off.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’d rather not rely on Niflheimr if I can.”
 </p>
 <p>
  But if the situation worsens, I have no choice.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you want to rely on your backing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Feel free to do so.
 </p>
 <p>
  I leaned back in my chair.

  The next day.
 </p>
 <p>
  As usual, I cooked and ate ramen before heading to the training camp.

 <p>
  Jenna was waiting for me. We did some warm-up exercises together before starting our running routine. Jenna was running on the track as usual.
 </p>
 <p>
  After lightly sweating from the run, we were about to start the stamina training when Jenna unexpectedly spoke up with a determined expression on her face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Excuse me, Oppa!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m in your hands!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you eat something bad again?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You said you’d survive if I start training with you. So I want to do it even more intensely! From now on I’m going to be in your hands!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna bowed her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  She’s quite determined.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You said you lived alone up until now, didn’t you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you lying?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No! I, Jenna Shirai, swear that I’ve been living alone! I haven’t even held hands with a guy!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled and said, “Relax. Don’t strain your shoulders. I won’t try anything funny like that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “As long as you don’t think about useless things like now and just focus on your tasks, you won’t die. So don’t worry too much.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you for your kind words!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I said don’t strain your shoulders. It’s annoying. I’m not a master. If we establish such a hierarchical relationship, it’ll just bother you.”

  “Even if it bothers me, I’m okay with establishing a hierarchical relationship! Oppa, please consider me as your Number 1 subordinate!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Who said you’re Loki’s Number 1 subordinate!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Here it comes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle exclaimed with a childish expression on her face.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I’m the Number 1 subordinate! You’re out!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why are you here?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Why are you next to Loki? Like a sly fox. Do you know who this person is? He’s different from a lowly woman like you. Pick Me Up’s god, the Master of… Ugh! Ugh!]
 </p>
 <p>
  I covered Iselle’s mouth and dragged her outside the training camp.
 </p>
 <p>
  I let go of her hand at a corner of the square.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why are you like this? Don’t show off to that kind of woman!”

  “You’re mistaken. I’m not the master here. Don’t say things like I came from Earth or I’m Loki. Got it? If you don’t listen to me, I won’t talk to you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are we good? Or do you have some objections?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, okay.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When we returned to the training camp, Jenna was looking at Iselle with a stern gaze.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anyway, Loki… I mean, Han, I’m your Number 1 subordinate, remember!”
 </p>
 <p>
  After giving Jenna a reproachful look, Iselle disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I shouldn’t have said anything to her.”
 </p>
 <p>
  My head starts to ache.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s wrong with her?”
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

  “Just ignore her. She’s just a fool.”
 </p>
 <p>
  And strictly speaking, my Number 1 subordinate would be Seris.
 </p>
 <p>
  In Niflheimr, I have subordinates who can be considered close to me, up to Number 5. They are level 99 with various ultimate skills and possess the 5 Divine Artifacts I painstakingly created.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ll probably meet them as I climb the tower.
 </p>
 <p>
  We continued with our training routine.
 </p>
 <p>
  While doing push-ups, I checked my stats, which had been enhanced through synthesis.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hann Israt (★) Lv. 7 (Exp 13/50)]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Class: Novice]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Strength: 19/19]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Intelligence: 13/13]

 <p>
  [Stamina: 18/18]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Agility: 18/18]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Skills: Low-Level Swordsmanship (Lv.3), Pain Resistance (Lv.1), Composure (Lv.1)]
  <br/>
  (T/N: It says Swordsmanship, but I think it’s just a mistake, it should be Shield and Swordsmanship…)
 </p>
 <p>
  My strength increased by 2, stamina by 2, and agility by 2, resulting in a total stat increase of 6. However, my intelligence decreased by 1, so the overall growth value is 5. Considering that the base growth value for a 1-star is 4, this is a remarkable change. The efficiency of leveling up has increased by 20%.
 </p>
 <p>
  Furthermore, I obtained the composure skill that I desired.
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed, synthesis proved to be the most efficient method of growth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now it’s time to examine Jenna.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Jenna Shirai (★) Lv. 5 (Exp 22/40)]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Class: Novice]

 <p>
  [Skills: Low-Level Archery (Lv.4), Eye of the Hawk (Lv.1)]
 </p>
 <p>
  “A typical archer type.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In the previous synthesis, she even gained the Eye of the Hawk skill, which enhances eyesight.
 </p>
 <p>
  As her level and rank increase, she can transition from a thief to an archer, and eventually to a sniper.
 </p>
 <p>
  Stamina training is complete.
 </p>
 <p>
  As my level increased, the training gradually became easier. I discussed with Jenna that we would increase the intensity starting from tomorrow. We would wear sandbags and run or reduce the fingers used for push-ups. As the level of the training camp rises, more diverse methods will become available.
 </p>
 <p>
  After lunch, we regrouped at the training camp.

 <p>
  That’s when something unexpected happened.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a corner of the training camp, a young man with short hair stood with a determined expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was Aaron. He rarely even showed up in the square, let alone the training camp. Aaron came up to me energetically.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Excuse me!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is it? I’m busy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let me join you too!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Join us?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I want to fight too. I want to be of help to you. So, please teach me how to fight!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron bowed deeply.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m sorry. I… I was a fool. I was only causing trouble. But now, things will be different. Just once, please trust me!”
 </p>

  “How can I trust you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, if you want, I’ll even kneel. Please…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seems like you’ve come to your senses.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna jabbed me with her elbow.
 </p>
 <p>
  I smirked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Y-Yes?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Have you ever fought a monster?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron shook his head hesitantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Before coming here, I didn’t even know if such things existed, let alone fight them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a matter of determination. The determination to fight even if it means dying, no, the determination to fight and survive.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I swiftly threw a spear from the weapon pouch.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s this…?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a spear.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “S-spear…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m not an expert either, but I heard it’s the easiest weapon to master. Give it a try. Do you know the principle of balance?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s the principle of balance?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Close range, mid-range, long range.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna pondered for a moment and clapped her hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah! Close range, sword! Mid-range, spear! Long range, bow! These three make up the principle of balance, right?”

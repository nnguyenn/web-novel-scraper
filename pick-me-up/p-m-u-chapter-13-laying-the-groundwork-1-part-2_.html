  For 1-star individuals without any special skills, if they are sent out randomly, it usually ends in a simple brawl. Naturally, in such cases, the survival rate of heroes hits rock bottom.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s when the concept of party composition based on the principle of balance emerged.

 <p>
  First, the swordsman takes the lead and assumes the role of a tank with a shield and sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  The spearman assists the swordsman from mid-range, serving as a secondary tank and dealer.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the archer takes the main role in sniping and dealing damage from long range.
 </p>
 <p>
  If role distribution is carried out organically, not only combat power but also survival rates skyrocket. That is, if the roles are properly fulfilled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shall we see your skills?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I lifted my wooden shield and took hold of my wooden sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron stood there, holding a spear, looking uncertain.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you doing? Aren’t you prepared to fight?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Fi-fighting? Aren’t you going to teach me first?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You expect me to teach you when I’ve never even held a spear before?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well then…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I learned on my own too. You can learn on your own as well. Be grateful that there’s someone to spar with. When I first came here I fought against scarecrows alone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron adjusted his stance, but his frightened expression was evident.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hyah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron shouted with a strange vigor as he thrust his spear forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  His body was filled with tension, and he closed both his eyes. As I took a step to the side, the spear cut through the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t a fight of life and death.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he gets scared like this in a simple spar, how would he fare in an actual battle?

 <p>
  I swiftly pulled the spearhead toward me with my left hand, holding the shield.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron stumbled and fell to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh… ugh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Get up. Is this all you’ve got? If I were a monster, you’d already be defeated.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I-I’ll get up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s inevitable for his stance to be awkward.
 </p>
 <p>
  To a skilled individual, even I would appear hopelessly clumsy. The problem lies in his mindset. There’s no drive. No desire to win. No cool-headedness in seeking weaknesses.
 </p>
 <p>
  It only appears as if he’s forcing himself to do it because he doesn’t want to die.
 </p>
 <p>
  An hour passed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hah, hah, hah…”

 <p>
  Aaron lay sprawled on the floor of the training camp. His chest moved up and down without a moment’s rest. In contrast, I had only broken a sweat.
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s almost a double stat difference between me at level 7 and Aaron at level 1.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, no matter how much my body and skills may be superior, it’s somewhat disheartening that he can’t even touch me. It’s not like the difference is overwhelmingly vast.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Get up. Let’s go again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I-I can’t… anymore…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well then, don’t come tomorrow.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron turned his body over and slowly got up. His whole body was covered in sweat.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna said, “Shouldn’t we take a break?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m not planning to carry your baggage. If you can’t keep up, I’ll leave you behind.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh, ugh…”

  Aaron held the spear unsteadily.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you have any family?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “M-My… younger sister… is waiting.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re better off than me. I have no one.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I flicked my wooden sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you’re going to do it half-heartedly because you feel sorry, don’t do it at all. If you come out like that, you’ll die at the hands of a monster. It’ll be much more painful than dying through synthesis. Do you understand?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I… I want to… protect my sister…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Protect her? You need to go back alive first!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron’s gaze suddenly changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s more like it.”

 <p>
  “I’m coming!”
 </p>
 <p>
  After the training ended, Jenna took the completely exhausted Aaron to the dormitory.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although he still couldn’t land a hit on me, Aaron achieved the feat of making me use a shield. He even started attempting techniques like swinging rather than just thrusting. It was progress. If he polished his skills a bit more, I wouldn’t have to worry about him holding us back.
 </p>
 <p>
  The next morning, Aaron joined the training ranks.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was far behind us, huffing and puffing while carrying the sandbag, but he didn’t seem to have any intention of giving up. He perked up whenever his sister was mentioned.
 </p>
 <p>
  After lunch, we began the sparring session.
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, Aaron sparred with Jenna instead of me. Jenna needed a secondary weapon in case she dropped her arrows or couldn’t use her bow. Luckily, there was a decent wooden dagger available.
 </p>
 <p>
  Spear and dagger.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no comparison in reach or power between the weapons, and Jenna had never handled a dagger before either, but she consistently overwhelmed Aaron.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why is she a 1-star?”
 </p>

 <p>
  I felt that the ranking system was unreasonable.
 </p>
 <p>
  After that day’s training came to an end, Aaron returned to the dormitory with a self-deprecating expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I went easy on him.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t get cocky.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I flicked Jenna’s forehead.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It hurts. Why did you do that? I’m your first subordinate!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did I ever ask you to become my subordinate? Tsk, tsk.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I stuck out my tongue and walked out to the plaza. Jenna hurriedly followed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You know it was a joke! You’re such a bully.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anyway, come with me. I have something to do.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “What is it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ll find out if you come along.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I stood in front of the steel gate at the corner of the plaza. The plaque on the gate read ‘Storage.’
 </p>
 <p>
  “Iselle, open the storage.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Wait!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Creak…
 </p>
 <p>
  With an old sound, the gate opened.
 </p>
 <p>
  We entered the storage. Inside, there was a large metal rack with hundreds of compartments. Most of the compartments were empty, but there were scattered items in some of them. At the entrance of the storage, there was a wheeled cart.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So it’s like this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I pulled the cart at the entrance and pushed it towards Jenna.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-12" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  “Follow me with this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you planning to do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stop asking questions.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I dragged the complaining Jenna and walked towards a corner of the racks. In the top compartment, there was a package wrapped in brown paper, resembling a bundle. I took out the package and inspected its contents.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Iron Ore (C)]
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the package, there were iron ingots.
 </p>
 <p>
  I placed the paper-wrapped iron ore into the cart. Looking at other compartments, there were also leather and timber. I selected a few and placed them inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★)’ has exported 6 Iron Ore (C), 3 Leather (C), and 4 Cardboard (C) from the storage.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Before I knew it, the cart was full.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took Jenna and walked back to the plaza.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Open the armory.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The armory doors began to open.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What on earth are you planning?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We can’t keep using old iron swords forever, can we?”
 </p>
 <p>
  We had the materials, the blacksmithy was open, and autonomous actions were enabled.
 </p>
 <p>
  So naturally,
 </p>
 <p>
  we had to make weapons.

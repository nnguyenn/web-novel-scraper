 <p>
  Several days later in the afternoon.
 </p>
 <p>
  I stood with my arms crossed against the wall of the dimensional rift.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-1" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 </div>
 <p>
  In front of me, there was the disassembled appearance of the Capitalism ship. Beyond its iron framework, various devices and the blue-light emitting circular dimension core were visible.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clunk. Clunk clunk.
 </p>
 <p>
  Radi, in a yellow maintenance outfit, was repairing the interior.
 </p>
 <p>
  A belt with a spanner, hammer, and a small bag filled with screws was hanging around her waist.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How long will it take?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re too short on manpower. At least a week is needed. It could be more.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Radi pushed back her bangs and tightened a screw.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the deck, Katiio was busy infusing magic into the dimension core.
 </p>
 <p>
  Various forms of magic circles appeared and disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  It would be great if we could use the hijacked airship right away, but unfortunately, it’s not that simple.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to Katiio, he was in the process of substituting default values for dimensional position changes. It seems to mean that it takes time.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But why are you loitering around? You look like you have somewhere to go. Don’t tell me… you want to go back to Harla?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why not?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I wouldn’t recommend it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio stopped his hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  A shadow fell over his face.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hey, you villains, can you hear me!]
 </p>
 <p>
  A loud voice echoed through the dimensional rift.
 </p>

 <p>
  I turned around.
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you can hear me, answer. This is Captain Iselle, destined to be the King of Pirates!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The voice was coming from inside the airship.
 </p>
 <p>
  I changed direction, leaped onto the airship, and stepped onto the deck.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The communicator was working, huh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Magician brat, you, traitor! How could you repay the kindness of being fed and sheltered like this? When you come back, you’ll get five hundred spankings on the butt!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Whirring.
 </p>
 <p>
  A translucent hologram appeared from the dashboard.
 </p>
 <p>
  A slender figure. Dressed in red, wearing a triangular hat and an eyepatch, it was Harla’s Iselle.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Are you keeping clean? The manifestation of justice is not far away. If you repent while crying now, I might spare you.]

 <p>
  Iselle got into the rhythm and started doing some weird moves.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Though typhoons rage and fierce winds blow, The Pirate King, undaunted, she’ll show! Rising time and again with might, Leading her golden fleet through the night. Invincible on the endless sea, The ultimate ruler, forever she’ll be~♪]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just state your business.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s my theme song for my entrance. You should listen till the end…….]
 </p>
 <p>
  I reached out to the dashboard.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ah, okay! Don’t turn it off! I’ll talk.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The fairy adjusted the angle of her triangular hat and stood tall.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ahem, I have come to declare war.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Declaration of war?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’ll be surprised when you hear it. By my command, the golden fleet is assembling.]
 </p>

 <p>
  The fairy spun her body around and pointed behind her.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle. The hologram screen slightly shook, and then the scenery changed. The dimensional rift, a hangar. Several airships were stationary.
 </p>
 <p>
  [How about that? Just looking at it is impressive, right?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you come here to brag?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “She’ll continue to talk even if you don’t want to listen.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio muttered with a bored look.
 </p>
 <p>
  Regardless, the fairy continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I contacted you because I wanted to give you a chance.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “A chance.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes, a special opportunity to join the invincible fleet. The last lifeline. Your last chance! Soon, that place will turn into a sea of fire under our bombardment.]

 <p>
  The fairy coughed a couple of times.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your achievements were impressive to me too. Han Israt! The giant hunter of the sandstorm. That’s enough to share in my glory.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘She must have seen the MyTube videos.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Whirring.
 </p>
 <p>
  A device next to the dashboard made noise and something popped out of a hole.
 </p>
 <p>
  I picked it up.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Declaration of War&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;I, Captain Iselle, hereby declare a fair and square challenge to you….&gt;.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you going to do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”

  “It may seem like that, but it’s not easy. He has actually succeeded before.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seven airships were visible in the background.
 </p>
 <p>
  Combining the total power, he has about a hundred heroes in seven airships. There’s also a high possibility of having more, a plus alpha.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Preparations are already complete. I’ve received enough support. If you come here, I’ll personally propose to the Master to stop the invasion.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are the preparations all finished?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I can fight and win against anyone!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m coming now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Click.
 </p>
 <p>
  I pressed a button on the dashboard, and the hologram turned off.
 </p>
 <p>
  I said to Katiio, who was staring at me with a blank expression.
 </p>

  “Get this airship ready to leave immediately.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s still under maintenance… We’ve dismantled the outer panels, and in this condition, a single shot can turn it into a pile of scrap metal…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s okay. Just get me there.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The declaration of war meant that the battle preparations were complete.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no need to wait for more fish to gather.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……It’ll take 10 minutes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nuna!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We can do it. We just need to get it back to where it was originally.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I left the two arguing behind me and stepped out of the dimensional rift.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked up at the sky. Dark black. The Master is not connected.

 <p>
  &lt;I see you are going to use that.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “If not now, when?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Summoning weapons from Niflheimr.
 </p>
 <p>
  Only three chances. Difficult to use during missions, and preparation is cumbersome.
 </p>
 <p>
  But now, the conditions were met.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Preparations are complete. I can do it whenever you command.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  I went back to my room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nothing special. Put on armor, hang a dagger sheath, carry potions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Three things and it’s done.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where are you going?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I bumped into Edis while coming out of the corridor,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just for a walk.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I answered nonchalantly and passed by.
 </p>
 <p>
  Returning to the dimensional rift, two people were waiting.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We managed somehow. The location setting is also done.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Radi wiped her sweat and looked back at the airship.
 </p>
 <p>
  Its framework was still exposed. Katiio grumbled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a foolish act. Just one hit and it can crash.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you really going? Alone at that. Everyone must be waiting to strike. You’re not really betraying everyone… No, if that was the case, why did you persuade me…”
 </p>

  I lightly tapped Katiio’s head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll be back soon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Keep today’s events a secret. Don’t tell anyone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Leaving the two behind, I boarded the airship.
 </p>
 <p>
  As I entered the cockpit, a hologram appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Capitalism!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Access granted.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Auto-pilot mode’ is set.]
 </p>
 <p>
  I touched the start button at the bottom.
 </p>

 <p>
  With a light vibration, the airship began to move.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han(★★★)’ embarks on an expedition!]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This log should be erased.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I stepped out onto the deck.
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio was looking up at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What on earth…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio, who seemed about to say something to me, eventually turned his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do as you like. I don’t know anymore.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled silently.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, the airship pierced through the swirl of dimensions and emerged.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dimension 1935 – Townia]
 </p>
 <p>
  An unchanging desolate landscape.

 <p>
  Then, the airship pierced through the swirl of dimensions and emerged.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dimension 1935 – Townia]

 </div>
 <p>
  An unchanging desolate landscape.
 </p>
 <p>
  I entered the cockpit and pressed a button on the dashboard.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hey, why did you cut off the communication like that!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your Master, is he connected right now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Why are you asking that?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Answer my question.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Uh, no?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I opened my mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Tell everyone to prepare for death.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Click.
 </p>
 <p>
  I cut off the communication and stepped outside.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Initiating Dimensional Leap!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Once again, the landscape changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dimension 3847 – Harla]
 </p>
 <p>
  I took a deep breath.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the other side of the tower, the swirl of dimensions was spitting out one airship after another. On each airship, there were installed balistas, catapults, and magic cannons – all large and various weapons.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s of higher grades than this one.’

 <p>
  Both the scale and equipment were superior.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if the Union Guild is rich, they wouldn’t give such airships for free.
 </p>
 <p>
  They must be temporarily lent.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You arrogant bastard!]
 </p>
 <p>
  On a medium airship 50m away, the fairy stood with her cloak fluttering.
 </p>
 <p>
  Next to her, a line of small airships floated side by side.
 </p>
 <p>
  [I told you I’m a merciless fairy. There won’t be a second chance!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The fairy looked over this way and snorted.
 </p>
 <p>
  [What’s with the state of your airship? Can you even fight properly? Where are your subordinates?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”

 <p>
  [Anyway, you’re out! Even if you kneel and beg now, I won’t show mercy!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle!
 </p>
 <p>
  Blue magic energy began to gather at the cannon installed at the bow.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took off my left leather glove.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Master, anytime.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the ring on my left hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  A faint golden light swirled on its surface, and streamlined characters emerged.
 </p>
 <p>
  One turn to the left.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then two turns to the right.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Reception complete.&gt;
 </p>

 <p>
  The ring was bathed in golden light.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Summoning your chosen weapon.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Number 47.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Launching.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  I extended my right hand forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  Something solid touched my hand. Grasping it and pulling it out, a dazzlingly bright white sword appeared. I adjusted my grip on the hilt.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  A magic cannon charged with the power of lightning shot straight towards me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I lightly swung down the sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Fragarach (S+)’ absorbed the attack!]
 </p>

 <p>
  Suddenly, the space in front became blurry, and the magic cannon seemed to curve and was absorbed into the blade.
 </p>
 <p>
  [What, what?]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Fragarach.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Its grade is S+.
 </p>
 <p>
  It can reflect, absorb, or mitigate all physical and magical damage depending on its power.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Number 89.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Launching.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  I pulled a small orb from thin air.
 </p>
 <p>
  The orb, resembling an eyeball, flickered ominously in purple.
 </p>
 <p>
  Inserting it into my left eye, the orb vanished in light.
 </p>

 <p>
  [Special ability activated!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Eye of Argus (S)’ is now in effect.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Acquired Skill – ‘Thousand Eyes (Lv. Max)’]
 </p>
 <p>
  I closed and then opened my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the airship in front of me. Its exterior became transparent, revealing the interior.
 </p>
 <p>
  Numerous mechanical devices and components, and even the heroes moving inside the ship.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Thousand Eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the ultimate evolution skill for detecting weaknesses, which could only be activated with a special item.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The control room is below?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The dimension core was flashing red.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  [What, what’s going on? Why isn’t it working!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The flashes of light from the magic cannon were completely extinguished by Fragarach.
 </p>
 <p>
  The same went for the arrows from the ballista and the stones from the catapult. The power is so high that it cannot be reflected, but this is enough.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Number 11.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Launching.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  A golden spear appeared in my left hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gungnir.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack!
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, lightning struck from the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lightning gathered at the tip of the spear.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-12" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  &lt;You may release the sword now.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  I let go of Fragarach.
 </p>
 <p>
  The white sword floated in the air and began to move on its own.
 </p>
 <p>
  It had accumulated enough magic for automatic defense.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Eye of Argus and Gungnir, synchronization complete.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  I narrowed my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Besides the dimension core, two other places were flashing red. They were the weaknesses of that particular airship.
 </p>
 <p>
  Golden lightning rippled on the blade of the spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Holding the spear, I said,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ever heard of ‘pay to win’?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [P-, Pay to win?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll show you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s not really my style, though.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I threw the spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Wham!
 </p>
 <p>
  The spear, transformed into a bolt of lightning, covered tens of meters in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  The lightning pierced through the airship’s thick exterior and solid interior, penetrated the dimension core, then detonated the fuel line and pierced through the control room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Heroes caught in the path of the lightning turned to ash and vanished.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘One.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  The airship exploded, sending up smoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  I extended my hand. The spear flew back and twirled around it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I have no intention of leaving any behind.’
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s no use in taking them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if I take them, we can’t use them.
 </p>
 <p>
  We neither have the resources nor the ability to operate several airships.
 </p>
 <p>
  Six airships remained.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Destroy everything.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Lightning began to gather at the tip of the spear again.

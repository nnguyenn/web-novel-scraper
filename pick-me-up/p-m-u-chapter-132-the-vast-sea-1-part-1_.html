 <p>
  Several days later, one evening.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What on earth did you do?”
 </p>

 <p>
  Katiio came to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I replied, “What do you mean?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You said that guy came in with a fleet of airships, even declaring war. But then he just turned around with his half-destroyed fleet and returned as if nothing happened.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah after I convinced him.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Convinced him?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s just absurd…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I laughed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio, being the only one who was on the scene that day, found it hard to believe.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even so, I couldn’t tell him. Frustrated, Katiio left the room grinding his teeth.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is strange.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Since that day, Harla’s master, who used to send abusive chats to Anytng every day, became quiet.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Golden Fleet, which threatened to turn this place into a sea of fire, was nowhere to be seen. Naturally. They were all destroyed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Asking Yurnet, she said Harla’s Master had given up on the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  He simply can’t operate the waiting room without a fairy.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had once seen such a control window; it was a dismal environment just by looking at it.
 </p>
 <p>
  The screen would freeze every three seconds, and icons wouldn’t respond when clicked. The heroes of gathering and crafting, who were the foundation of the waiting room, had largely disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Did he say he sent a bug report?’
 </p>

 <p>
  Unable to find a sharp solution, he eventually quit the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  I wish I was there to see his face.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anyway, the annoying guy was gone.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was concerned his backing might cause trouble, but according to Yurnet’s report, there was no such sign.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then it was time to move on.
 </p>
 <p>
  The next evening.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Welcome to Pick Me Up!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Loading complete.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [T O U C H ! (Select)]
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng, having logged into the game, skipped the announcements and went straight to the hero tab.
 </p>

 <p>
  Then, he started reorganizing the party.
 </p>
 <p>
  He combined the 4th and 5th parties, which had lost members, and sent them to the third floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, promising rookies from the first floor were moved to the second floor and given training orders. Heroes with maxed levels were promoted. Gatherers were sent to daily dungeons. He was now quite adept at this.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Katiio is…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Seemed like he decided to hold off for now.
 </p>
 <p>
  Apart from orders for research and airship maintenance, he wasn’t sent to any particular party.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It looks like a month of rest.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Ping!
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna released her hand from the bowstring.
 </p>
 <p>
  The arrow hit the center of the target. The red part of the target was already filled with arrows.
 </p>

  “I don’t understand why this is taking so long. Do you know, senior?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hard to say.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With each swing of Velkist’s sword, deep marks were engraved on the iron dummy.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It looks like he’s thinking about party composition.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka, who had been rolling a fireball in her palm in a corner of the training ground, shuddered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist put down his sword and said, “It means he’s pondering who to remove from the first party.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you talking about? We’re perfect as we are. Such a foolish thought.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why are you so angry?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist smirked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you afraid…”
 </p>

 <p>
  Eloka rolled her eyes and entered the magic hall with angry steps.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is ridiculous.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t tease her. It’s impossible that the master would remove her. She’s so important to our party. Right, Oppa?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna said to me, still not releasing her hand from the bowstring.
 </p>
 <p>
  She hit the target again.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Party composition.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at Anytng’s control window.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng seemed to be pondering something with the hero box open.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Velkist might be right.”
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-6" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
  <script async="" crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4984013611805253">

 </div>
 <p>
  “What did I tell you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course, that’s only half the answer.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I laughed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Would he remove Eloka? Maybe someone else, but not her.”
 </p>
 <p>
  To utilize Eloka’s magic, we learned fire resistance and practiced related formations.
 </p>
 <p>
  But to remove her now would be against the party concept. If Amkena gave such an order, I would refuse.
 </p>
 <p>
  The same goes for other members.
 </p>
 <p>
  I wouldn’t be removed, and Jenna was crucial for mid-range firepower. Velkist and I were the attackers at the front, and without Neryssa, we’d face problems in information warfare.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The balance is right.’
 </p>
 <p>
  All five members had clear roles.
 </p>

 <p>
  If efficiency had fallen, we would have replaced members long ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  What Anytng was actually pondering was probably whether to put Katiio in a sub-party or not. If the abilities of party members don’t back up a support-type wizard, efficiency plummets.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eventually, Anytng closed the hero box without any action.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then, several days later, one evening.
 </p>
 <p>
  [First party, gather up!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle’s voice echoed in the training ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  It had been a while since the last call. We quickly got ready and headed to the first-floor plaza.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were still no changes to the party. Eloka said confidently, “See, I told you. Elemental magicians are the best. Let that wizard play with his airships. I’ll shine in the mission.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why are you suddenly feeling competitive? He doesn’t even care about you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anyway, let’s go.”
 </p>

 <p>
  Eloka coughed and walked ahead.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Poor sister. She’s probably fixed in the party anyway.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who said that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re more likely to be removed than Eloka,” Neryssa said with a smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That won’t happen.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you sure?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Insolent woman, looking for death…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Save the love quarrel for later.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I pushed Velkist’s back from behind.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist entered the space rift with a displeased expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, Jenna, Neryssa, and I entered, and the door closed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Climb the tower, save the world!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Main Dungeon: Current Floor – 30]
 </p>
 <p>
  The mirror in the middle of the space rift shone.
 </p>
 <p>
  The meaning was clear. Jenna gripped her bow tightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Finally. This time, I hope it’s somewhere comfortable, not like a maze or desert.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “For example?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A flower garden.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…That’s the worst.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Such fields usually have man-eating plants or underground monsters.

  The familiar system message appeared.

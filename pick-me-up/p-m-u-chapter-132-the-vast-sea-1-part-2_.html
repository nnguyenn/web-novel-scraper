 <p>
  We were ready.
 </p>
 <p>
  10 seconds later.
 </p>

 <p>
  The light from the mirror enveloped us.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the light faded, I slowly opened my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first thing I saw was the mission objective window in the top right corner of my vision.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Floor 31.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Mission Type – Exploration]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Objective – Search the designated area!]
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s good to see the objective from the start.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took a breath and looked around.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna let out a deflated sound.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Splash.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked up.
 </p>
 <p>
  A wide, blue sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked down.
 </p>
 <p>
  Waves rolling beyond, the horizon stretching to the end of my sight.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where, where is this?! Why is there so much water?”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Is this the rumored… sea?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist groaned.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna jumped around in panic.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But this place is…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t jump. It shakes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I examined the floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  The planks were crudely intertwined. It was about 10 meters wide, with a pillar and a small sail in the center. A carelessly placed oars were next to the pillar.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Huh.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “To summarize the situation,” Neryssa said in a calm voice.

 <p>
  “We’ve been summoned to a boat on the sea.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What, what? What is this? Why suddenly such a place?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t know either.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa finished speaking and looked at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the same time, three pairs of eyes turned to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They want me to sort it out.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I sighed and said, “Alright, alright.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What should we do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “First, check what’s on the boat. There should be useful items.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I muttered and started walking.
 </p>

 <p>
  There was a wooden barrel at the bow. I opened it. It contained simple food and water.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oppa, there’s something strange here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I took what Jenna handed to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  A circular object fitting in the palm, with a long needle visible inside the glass.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a compass.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Didn’t you find a map?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I put the compass in my pocket and asked.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist shook his head. Neryssa did the same. I also searched but found nothing.
 </p>
 <p>
  The only things on the boat were food, water, a compass, and oars.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka spoke with a ridiculous expression, “This is nonsense. Thrown into the sea and told to explore.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Should have asked to be sent to the desert.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There must be a reason we’re here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I took out the compass again and examined it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What should we do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We have to row around.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I lifted the oar with my foot and grabbed it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll go in the direction the compass points.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the mast.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sail fluttered in the wind.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The wind direction is roughly right.’

 <p>
  One peculiarity was the prepared food and water.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was likely a long-term mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  I put my hand on my forehead.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Annoying.’
 </p>
 <p>
  This was more bothersome than a maze.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Two oars and five people. We can row in pairs.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oar? You mean that wide wooden stick?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You row with it to move forward.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I had never done it myself.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had to find out how while doing it.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-7" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  The presence of oars meant that relying on wind alone would be slow.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have a question.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Everyone’s gaze focused on me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do any of you know how to swim?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Everyone became mute.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Damn it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  We’ll need swimming lessons when we return to the waiting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anyway, the mission was given.
 </p>
 <p>
  Like it or not, we had to do it.
 </p>
 <p>
  I assigned pairs.
 </p>

 <p>
  Me with Velkist, Jenna with Neryssa.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What about me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why? I can do it too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka protested.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The balance won’t be right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If the strength of two people rowing on each side isn’t similar, the direction might veer off.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t for no reason that I paired a warrior and a rogue together.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then what should I…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sit still. And.”
 </p>
 <p>
  This was the key point.
 </p>
 <p>
  I lowered my voice and said, “Never use fire magic. If you don’t want to become fish food.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka froze on the spot.
 </p>
 <p>
  She looked like she had been hit hard on the back of her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, no…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Think about it. This is the sea. The boat is wood. If it catches fire, we all die.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka’s flames don’t extinguish easily even when doused with water.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, as the casting involves igniting the caster’s body, it was dangerous in itself.
 </p>
 <p>
  The compatibility was the worst.
 </p>
 <p>
  If she had used wind magic, the situation would have been completely different.

 <p>
  There would have been no need to row with such effort.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Alright.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka lowered her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no choice. Elementalists are the most affected by the characteristics of the field.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If such fields continue after the 31st floor…’
 </p>
 <p>
  She’s out.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ll think about it after the mission is over.
 </p>
 <p>
  I grabbed the oar.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We always end up doing all sorts of things.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist muttered from the opposite side.
 </p>

  “If it’s hard, let me know. I’ll switch right away.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Go to sleep. It won’t be soon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It was nothing compared to our usual training intensity.
 </p>
 <p>
  I held the oar upside down and put it in the hole next to the boat.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then I let go and stood up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Ha.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bubbles were rising near the boat.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dark shadows emerged from the waves.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Carnivorous Shark Lv.18] X 9
 </p>
 <p>
  [Merman Lv.31] X 2
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, the boat rocked violently.
 </p>
 <p>
  The boat, almost flipping over, barely stabilized.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oppa!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I could handle ten or a hundred on solid ground, but this was above the sea.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t panic. Get ready to fight.”
 </p>
 <p>
  We all started preparing for battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sharks and mermen.
 </p>
 <p>
  A common combination in the sea.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If the boat flips, it’s over.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  The boat shook again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Black shadows moved chaotically under the water.
 </p>
 <p>
  The streamlined bodies briefly appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took off my gloves and drew a dagger.
 </p>
 <p>
  Without hesitation, I cut my palm. Blood oozed out with a sharp pain.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jenna, cover me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I took off the sword’s sheath and placed it against the mast.
 </p>
 <p>
  Splash!
 </p>
 <p>
  I dived into the sea.

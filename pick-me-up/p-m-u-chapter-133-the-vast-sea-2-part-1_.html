  “Really, you’re impossible to work with.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Slap!

 <p>
  Jenna smacked my back.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why hit me? It hurts.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You should have said something before leaving. You startled me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I did say something.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that what you call saying something? ‘Jenna, cover me.’ And then you just jump into a sea teeming with monsters. I thought my heart was going to stop.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna finished wrapping a bandage around my palm and sprayed some potion on it.
 </p>
 <p>
  A sharp pain shot through my wrist. I moved my left hand. The pain was bearable. There was no significant hindrance in movement.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Somehow, it worked out.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked around.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shark and merman corpses were floating on the sea.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ocean was stained red with their blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  The tactic was simple.
 </p>
 <p>
  Using sharks’ attraction to the smell of blood, I cut my palm and then lured them away from the ship. The sharks were dealt with using daggers and Jenna’s covering fire. The mermen were handled by the rest of the party.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was an improvisation, but it seemed to work well.
 </p>
 <p>
  I put on a glove on my left hand and stood up.
 </p>
 <p>
  After gauging the direction on the compass, I grabbed the oar.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s go. We don’t have time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can you row with that injured hand?”
 </p>

 <p>
  “It’s just a scratch. It’s nothing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka sighed quietly.
 </p>
 <p>
  She hadn’t been able to do anything in this battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  She had telekinesis, but it wasn’t strong enough to be her main force.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Sister.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna looked at Eloka with a bitter expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka hung her head and crouched in a corner of the boat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This isn’t a place I’d like to stay long.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist rowed from the right side.
 </p>
 <p>
  I synchronized his movements.
 </p>

 <p>
  Thus, the boat began to cut through the sea with the power of wind and oars.
 </p>
 <p>
  The waves were almost non-existent.
 </p>
 <p>
  The water surface was calm, and the wind direction matched our destination.
 </p>
 <p>
  After about two hours.
 </p>
 <p>
  A column of water shot up, and a dark figure appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Merman Lv. 32]
 </p>
 <p>
  About 2 meters tall.
 </p>
 <p>
  It had a bizarre appearance, like a mix of fish and human.
 </p>
 <p>
  Water dripped off its dark blue scales.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kyaaa!”
 </p>

 <p>
  The creature that climbed aboard the boat spat and roared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Buahh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  My oar, now half-crushed, collided with the creature’s face brutally.
 </p>
 <p>
  After finishing off the twitching merman with a dagger, I threw it back into the sea.
 </p>
 <p>
  “These guys have a habit of climbing onto boats, remember that. It’ll be a big help.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow, that was quick.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s switch now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa and Jenna took over the oars.
 </p>
 <p>
  The boat resumed its voyage, though at a slightly slower pace.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 </div>
 <p>
  There weren’t any major crises.
 </p>
 <p>
  Occasionally, sharks would circle under the water, and mermen would cause trouble.
 </p>
 <p>
  After all, it was just a sub-stage. As long as we stayed alert, the chance of failing was almost none.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The problem is when this mission ends.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The boat steadily followed the compass.
 </p>
 <p>
  I needed to know whether the next mission would have a similar environment or if there would be changes.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the 32nd floor progresses like this…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It can’t be helped.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at Eloka.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though she said she could row using telekinesis, it seemed difficult, and she ended up just being a burden.
 </p>

  “Why am I in this state…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He magician woman, why not try learning different magic?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You think it’s that easy? The fundamental concepts are completely different.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka pulled up her knees.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, after a whole day and night.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stage Clear!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han(★★★)’, ‘Jenna(★★★)’, Level Up!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Rewards – 150,000G, Tropical Fruit X 3, Mermaid Scale(Low-grade) X 5]
 </p>
 <p>
  [MVP – ‘Han(★★★)’]
 </p>
 <p>
  We cleared the mission on the ship at the sea.
 </p>

 <p>
  It’s confirmed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The 32nd floor will be also on the same field.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This mission is really annoying. It’s cramped, my arms hurt, and it’s boring.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna murmured as if fed up and stepped through the space-time rift.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist followed, and Neryssa glanced briefly at Eloka before heading to the plaza.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Hey.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  It was at that moment that Eloka spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng manipulated the operation window.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Forming a party.]
 </p>

 <p>
  [Drag and drop a hero!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Eloka(★★★)’ has been removed from ‘1st Party’!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Katiio(★★★★)’ has joined ‘1st Party’!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll try wind magic once we…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Surpriiise!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle appeared spinning a triple axel.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Eloka Revel Strassur! From today, you’re out of the 1st party. Take a good rest until Master calls you!]
 </p>
 <p>
  After finishing, Iselle winked slyly and disappeared along with the light.
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Looks like that’s the case.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Take a rest?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, it’s a holiday.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “For how long?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The field concept tends to remain the same every 5 or 10 floors.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sighed and said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “35th floor or maybe 40th.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s too long! If I rest that much, I’ll get rusty!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can’t help it. It’s the Master’s order. There’s no reason to object.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If there was even a slight reason, I could have intervened, but considering the events on the 31st floor, there was nothing I could do.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka’s eyes shook as if there was an earthquake.
 </p>

  “But…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry. I won’t abandon you. I’ll call you when the time is right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh, Ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka’s face turned red, and she shouted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master! To treat me as a hindrance! So I’m useless, right? I’ll learn other elements if I have to, just wait!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka stormed out through the space-time rift with angry steps.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Different elements, huh.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It won’t be easy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Elementalists usually only have talent in one element.

 <p>
  ‘I should ask Chloe to make something tasty for her.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was unfortunate, but Eloka was out of this mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled bitterly and exited.
 </p>
 <p>
  The next evening.
 </p>
 <p>
  [1st Party, gather!]
 </p>
 <p>
  As expected, Anytng called the 1st party for the 32nd-floor stage.
 </p>
 <p>
  But there was one difference.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re telling me to tag along with you? But the airship is still…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stop talking and come.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wai-, wait! Aaah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I dragged Katiio down to the first floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Afterwards, the door to the space-time rift closed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Eloka sister… isn’t here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna twirled her red hair with her fingers.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I told you. She’s not coming this time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm…”

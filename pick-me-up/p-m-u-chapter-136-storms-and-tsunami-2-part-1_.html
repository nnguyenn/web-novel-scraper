 <p>
  As the giant jaws closed, the flesh and blood of the Kraken poured out like a waterfall.
 </p>
 <p>
  The creature, having bitten into the writhing Kraken, shook its head from side to side before tossing it aside.

 <p>
  Splash!
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon, the Kraken’s corpse floated to the surface.
 </p>
 <p>
  Its flesh and innards were torn apart, leaving a gruesome sight.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t this the 33rd floor? Why all of a sudden…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna panicked as she drew her longbow.
 </p>
 <p>
  I inspected beneath the ship. The creature that had turned the Kraken into meat chunks in an instant had returned to the sea and was now swimming beneath us. A black shadow moved in an octagonal pattern on the water.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A boss appears on the 33rd floor?’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was an anomaly.
 </p>
 <p>
  I bit my lip in frustration.
 </p>
 <p>
  We were utterly unprepared for this encounter.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The mission type has been changed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Mission Type – Escape]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Objective – Flee from the danger zone!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Special Objective – Survive ‘Priasis Al Ragna’]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…How do we deal with that thing?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist muttered.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the mission window.
 </p>
 <p>
  The updated objective wasn’t to subjugate.

 <p>
  I felt somewhat relieved.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We don’t have to fight it. We run!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How are we going to run?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “With the ship….”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  The ship tilted sharply to the left.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Whoa…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sliding noises.
 </p>
 <p>
  All sorts of objects on the deck slid to one side.
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the sailors adjusting the sails lost his footing and fell overboard. He didn’t even have time to scream.

 <p>
  “Damn!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I clung to the railing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crash!
 </p>
 <p>
  The ship that had tilted to the left found its balance again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  An explosion of water shot up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly it appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Tens of meters in length, the creature had a body shaped like an eel.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gleaming with blue scales the Water Dragon roared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kuooooo!”

  “This doesn’t look good.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist muttered again.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, we’re screwed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  But.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can’t die here.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I drew my sword and shouted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This isn’t a fight. We don’t need to fight!”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Hehehehe…&gt;

 <p>
  With an eerie laugh, the Water Dragon dove back into the sea.
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned to Priasis, who was whining beside me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We need to get out of here as quickly as possible. Take the helm.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that possible? The wind is not favorable!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked up at the mast.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh! The sail was flapping wildly.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the wind direction was erratic. The situation was not suitable for sailing.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Damn…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  The deck shook violently, possibly hit by the Water Dragon.

 <p>
  Seawater poured onto the deck.
 </p>
 <p>
  If this continued, the ship would sink.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oppa, how do we counterattack? It seems to be attacking from underwater!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Don’t think about counterattacking.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Diving into the sea in an attempt to fight back would quickly turn us into shark bait.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, what?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We have to run.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It was an absurdly unfair mission, but there must be a way to overcome it.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at Priasis.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is there any special device on this ship?”
 </p>

 <p>
  “That…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis furrowed her brow.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There is. I’ve searched the ship.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio approached the helm and fiddled with a pillar.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems like an old airship that was converted into a sailing ship. It’s possible for a short time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is possible?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “High-speed sailing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio pressed a red button above the helm.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Nautilus’ high-speed sailing device is activated!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Vroom!

 <p>
  A strange sense of buoyancy was felt, and the ship started to move forward quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll take the helm. The escort target is…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, you prepare to summon the airship.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We won’t last long.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kuoooooo!
 </p>
 <p>
  A second roar from the Water Dragon followed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Water Dragon Ktaart’ roars.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The weather changes dramatically!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Monster Wave!]

 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Water Dragon Ktaart’ casts ‘Storm Surge’!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The whole ship began to shake.
 </p>
 <p>
  Waves several meters high surged like a tsunami.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kwaaaaa!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Water Dragon chased the ship, streaming columns of water.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;You cannot escape me!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Take the helm!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Remembering that the helmsman had fallen into the sea, I shouted to Priasis.
 </p>

 <p>
  Priasis nodded and took the helm.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  A tail emerged in front of the bow.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ship turned to the right. The rain mixed with the strong wind slapped my face.
 </p>
 <p>
  The attack came entirely from underwater.
 </p>
 <p>
  With no effective countermeasure ready, the system had designated survival as the mission objective.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Human! Humaaan! Kyaaaa! Kill…”
 </p>
 <p>
  An arrow pierced the forehead of a Mermaid climbing over the railing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Finally, there’s something for me to do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist swept back his wet bangs and drew his sword.

  He ran towards the railing. Behind him, Jenna loaded her bow and said,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Be careful not to fall off.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Easy for you to say.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The head of the Mermaid was cleanly sliced off.
 </p>
 <p>
  “To think I’m learning to steer the ship here… Ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I caught Priasis as she staggered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Th-thank you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s going to be hard to shake him off.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Water Dragon was faster than the sailing ship.
 </p>
 <p>
  A sailor ran up to Priasis.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s a hole in the bottom of the ship. Water is…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How long can we last?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh, maybe 10 minutes…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Han! What should we do…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Was this a trap mission from the start?’

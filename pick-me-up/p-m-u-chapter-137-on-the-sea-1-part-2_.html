  ‘Mermaid’s Tears.’
 </p>
 <p>
  An item that allows underwater breathing.

 <p>
  However, the daily dungeon where the materials to make it could be acquired wasn’t open yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mermaid’s Tears? You mean we can breathe underwater?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Swimming is a separate matter. Therefore, while the airship is moving, we will practice underwater combat.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you saw that anchovy, you’d know that it’s not easy to attack on the water. If it won’t come out of the water. We have to go in and deal with it ourselves.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Into the sea? That’s a bit…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Weapons don’t move well in water.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “For that, we have to learn a skill.”
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s a skill for underwater combat.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was absolutely necessary for the strategy.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry. There’s no need to set yourself on fire this time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I went through the briefing, checking other matters.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were a total of four points of interest marked on the map. You could assume one of them was Mermaid’s Tears, but the other three were unknown. We’d have to go and see for ourselves.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘And the key is…’
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no information yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether it was inside the water dragon’s body, somewhere outside the sea, or in the depths of the ocean.
 </p>
 <p>
  After conveying the mission-related content to the party members,
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked out the window.
 </p>

 <p>
  It was already late at night.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng had disconnected.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There are four facilities.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Lodgings, a training ground, an armory, and a waiting area.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having a waiting area means…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s possible to replenish and replace heroes.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Earlier, Anytng tried to call another party, but a message appeared saying the conditions weren’t met.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Iselle.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Loki, did you call?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle climbed onto my shoulder.
 </p>

  After folding her wings, she looked at me intently.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I want to communicate with the heroes in the waiting room. Can it be done?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The flow of time is different. It might be a bit difficult…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “If it can’t be done, then it can’t be helped.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [No, I’ll try!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle rolled up her sleeves.
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled and called the hero I wanted to communicate with.
 </p>
 <p>
  After a while.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Huh?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis’s voice resonated in my ear.

 <p>
  &lt;Han? Why didn’t you come out yet, what is happening inside?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just a bit of camping. Anyway, I called because I have something to tell you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Okay, tell me.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  I conveyed the necessary information.
 </p>
 <p>
  The current field, the characteristics of the boss, and what needed to be done.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;So, you’re saying we need to learn underwater combat?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not exactly underwater combat, but just get used to fighting on the water. The master will soon make a swimming pool. Pass it on to the other party.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Got it. I’ll pass it on. Don’t die.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The communication ended.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Phew!]

  Iselle slumped down, sweating profusely.
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled at Iselle.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s one more person left.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s not over yet?!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “If it can’t be done, it’s okay.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [No, no! This is a piece of cake! Haaa!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle waved her arms dramatically.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Fairy power!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Call Eloka.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The flame mage? Got it!]

  Sparks twinkled from her wings.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;You? Where are you speaking from?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Inside the mission.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;You’re still in the middle of a mission? It’s been three days already…&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  If the stage’s time is three times that of the waiting room, it fits roughly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is the training going well?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Of, of course. In a week, I’ll be able to crush that brat with a grand magic…&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Her voice faded.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seems it’s not going well.

  &lt;…Anyway, what’s up?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Drop the wind magic training.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;…What?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Use the flame magic you used on the 20th floor. The one that explodes inside the enemy. Make it usable within 30 seconds. Or increase the firepower. Ah, and learn how to swim too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Why so suddenly…&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “There might be a spot opening up in the first party.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Currently, there are five members, but the number of participants will increase for the main strategy.
 </p>
 <p>
  A minor disadvantage of a wizard is that they can’t simultaneously manage the airship and use support magic.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Katiio drives the airship he becomes useless in combat. Then, there’s no need to include him as a magician in the first party.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Katiio doesn’t seem to care about his position, either.’

  &lt;Are you joking? A spot opening up?&gt;

 <p>
  “I don’t joke about these things.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;But I’m useless in the sea…&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then forget it…”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Who said so!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, my head rang.
 </p>
 <p>
  She surprised me.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Just wait! I’ll master it perfectly and come back!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Alright.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;You’re not lying, right? This isn’t a joke?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “I said it’s not.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Okay, got it.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  A moment of silence followed.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;…Thank you.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stop, it’s giving me goosebumps. I told you because I need you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I ended the communication.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ugh!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle collapsed on the desk.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s over. Good job.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Haah… I thought I was going to die. But why make that decision? That woman doesn’t need to be called.]

  “If you take out Katiio due to airship operation, there will be one sport left, right?”

 <p>
  [But the mechanic can do that too…]
 </p>
 <p>
  I coughed loudly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle’s eyes widened in surprise.

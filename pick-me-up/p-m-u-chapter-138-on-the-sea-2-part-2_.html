 <p>
  After almost pulling an all-nighter, I learned the underwater combat skill.
 </p>
 <p>
  My movements in the water definitely improved. The resistance of moving underwater felt significantly reduced. I could now somewhat counter enemy attacks underwater.

 <p>
  However, since it was still level 1, my movements were not as fast as on land. More training was needed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We seem to have arrived at the first base.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I emerged from the water.
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio was standing at the entrance of the training area.
 </p>
 <p>
  Stepping onto the deck, Katiio pointed to the left.
 </p>
 <p>
  “See that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  At the tip of Katiio’s finger was an island, about 30 meters in size.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a rock island.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Capitalism’ has arrived at the first base.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Obtain the first item!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Atop the rock island, a small box was placed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aside from the box, it was completely empty.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What shall we do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What about the water dragon?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s roaming nearby.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…I see.’
 </p>
 <p>
  After two days of observation.
 </p>
 <p>
  The water dragon, indicated by the red circle, was patrolling the area in a certain pattern.

  If it didn’t move from the center, it would be easy.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If it’s too dangerous, we could wait for it to move away…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, we don’t have time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s one base in each cardinal direction.
 </p>
 <p>
  We don’t have the luxury of time to just wait for him to get further away.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Should I call the other members?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m enough alone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio began the chant.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon, light wrapped around my body. It was the water-walking magic. I stepped over the railing onto the water’s surface.

 <p>
  “Start the airship. And be ready to flee at any moment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio entered the cockpit.
 </p>
 <p>
  I approached the island with my hand on the hilt of my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  With each step, ripples spread from my toes.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No monsters.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The water’s surface was calm.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not even a fish, let alone a monster, was in sight.
 </p>
 <p>
  I climbed onto the rock and approached the box.

 <p>
  ‘Hmm…’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was an obvious choice.
 </p>
 <p>
  To risk danger for an item, or to avoid danger by forsaking the item.
 </p>
 <p>
  The answer was clear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  I kicked open the lid of the box.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★★★)’ has obtained ‘Mermaid’s Tears (Lowest Grade) X 5’!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Trigger activated!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the box were glass bottles filled with a transparent liquid.
 </p>
 <p>
  I swiftly packed the potions into a prepared leather pouch and then quickly left the rock island.

  ‘I knew it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The sky darkened to a navy hue.
 </p>
 <p>
  Wind and rain began to lash out.
 </p>
 <p>
  I ran across the churning water’s surface.
 </p>
 <p>
  I jumped over the railing into the cockpit. The red circle of the domain was rapidly approaching.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Han!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s go.”

  I went to the deck.
 </p>
 <p>
  The partially submerged airship was moving.
 </p>
 <p>
  And behind the ship, something huge was breaking through the water, approaching.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s faster than before.’
 </p>
 <p>
  We had easily fled the water dragon during our first escape, but this time, the distance wasn’t widening as easily.
 </p>
 <p>
  Woooooong!
 </p>
 <p>
  The airship’s siren began to blare.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon after, members of Party 1 rushed to the deck in a hurry.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s already here?”

 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  The water dragon leaped from the water, spraying a water column, and soared into the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  Opening its mouth in the air, it began gathering a blue light.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ktaart casts ‘Hydro Cannon’!]

  I flung open the door to the cockpit.

  “We’re not getting any distance!”

 <p>
  [A magical potion that allows heroes to breathe underwater. However, there is a time limit.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This won’t do.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I closed the pouch.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though I had learned underwater combat, the skill was only at level 1.
 </p>
 <p>
  At this level, it wasn’t effective enough.

 <p>
  Waves surged, and an unexpected deluge of water flooded the deck.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…There’s nothing we can do.”

  The water cannon grazed the corner of the deck.
 </p>
 <p>
  The iron plating was shaved off like tofu. I regained my balance and shouted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s okay, do it!”

 </p>
 <p>
  It was an image of the airship racing across the sea. Behind it, the water dragon pursued.
 </p>
 <p>
  And above the screen, two buttons and a gauge bar appeared.
 </p>

 <p>
  [Ktaart casts ‘Hydro Cannon’!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  A fierce wind noise followed, and the airship tilted sharply to the right.

  The water cannon brushed past it.

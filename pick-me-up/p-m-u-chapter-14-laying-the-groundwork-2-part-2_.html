 <p>
  The sky was gloomy ash gray.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether it’s morning or evening, it’s the same shade of gray, but the landscape changes slightly depending on the time. For example, a bright gray in the early morning. A dark gray at late night.

 <p>
  Therefore it was already night.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Back to potatoes…” Jenna sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you tired of eating potatoes already?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course! Three meals a day, potatoes, potatoes, potatoes! I’ll throw up just looking at potatoes now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Jenna(★)’ expresses dissatisfaction with the lodging!]
 </p>
 <p>
  I’m starting to feel limited by my ramen-focused diet as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  Should I consider changing the lodging?
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  Well, then.
 </p>
 <p>
  The message I just received will be presented in a report format when the Master logs in. He could ignore it though, and if he does, we’ll just have to endure. Is there any other way?
 </p>
 <p>
  After parting with Jenna and returning to my room, I read the strategy guide I wrote.
 </p>
 <p>
  I checked for any mistakes and determined the direction I should take. Things were going well.
 </p>
 <p>
  The next afternoon, Aaron finally learned low-grade spear techniques.
 </p>
 <p>
  He’s still somewhat clumsy, but he has reached a level where he’s not completely helpless. I was able to move beyond fighting against scarecrows and practice against humans for a more diverse training experience.
 </p>
 <p>
  After throwing Aaron off guard I stood tall before him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mama!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoop!

 <p>
  And the next day.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Welcome to Pick Me Up!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The sky sparkles in white.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even without reading the message, I could tell. I closed the notebook with my goals written on it and stood up from the chair. As I stepped out into the square, I saw Aaron with a tense face and Jenna with a nonchalant expression waiting for me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Relax.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I patted Aaron’s shoulder with a smile.
 </p>

 <p>
  In the Master’s perception, Aaron might be at the edge of a cliff, but if we stick to the practice, we can avoid the worst-case scenario. As long as he shows minimal performance, he won’t be disposed of. The current ‘1 Party’ hadn’t even filled up the required number of members after all.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come to think of it, I don’t see any windows, the master isn’t…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Open, Rift of the time and space!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Han, Jenna, Aaron!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m going even if you don’t call my name.” Jenna was eager to enter.
 </p>
 <p>
  Does this mean he’ll proceed with the strategy of just using the three of us?
 </p>
 <p>
  That was also one way to do it, but this is not it. It’s true that the difficulty level of the tower’s floors wasn’t high at this point, but just adding a level 1, 1-star hero to an experienced party would only be a hindrance.
 </p>
 <p>
  But we can’t do anything about it.
 </p>
 <p>
  I entered the armory, picked up a sword and shield, and then threw the spear to Aaron.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s this…”

 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, Hyung-nim!”
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  Just looking at his face, he looks older than me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hyung-nim, I’ll do my best!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, that’s enough.”

 <p>
  Jenna then smiled and said, “Let’s all do our best together.”
 </p>
 <p>
  We entered the rift of time and space. The mirror on the left side shimmered, and the location changed. The wind blew through the dense trees, carrying a sense of anticipation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s a forest.

 <p>
  Upper body of a woman, lower body of a bird. Just as expected, they look disgusting.
 </p>
 <p>
  The troublesome thing about harpies is that they fly in the sky and primarily attack from hard-to-reach heights.
 </p>
 <p>
  I said to Jenna, “You take care of those harpies.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I had a feeling you’d say that. I wanted to try using the bow you gave me properly, and now I can.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You protect Jenna. The harpies will be specifically targeting her.”
 </p>
 <p>
  My sword cannot reach where the harpies are.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron, with his long spear, was perfect for dealing with them.
 </p>
 <p>
  I swiftly swung my iron sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  The grip feels good, and the weight is just right. The blade gleamed a pale blue, almost as if it were glowing. Truly a weapon I created. It can’t even be compared to an old iron sword. The shield made of solid iron also exuded a smooth shine.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are no long-range attackers. The goblins armed with swords and shields approached us while leaving the harpies in the air. For this battle, we decided to wait until the goblins approached. Going out to fight would be fine, but once I leave, the formation will break.

 <p>
  One of the fundamental principles of combat.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swordsmen must fight enemies within the reach of their allies’ spears.
 </p>
 <p>
  An arrow was shot from Jenna’s bow.
 </p>
 <p>
  The arrow pierced the wing of a harpy on the left.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kiiii!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The harpy with the arrow in its wing charged at Jenna.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aaron!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uwaaaaah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron swung his spear wildly.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Aaron(★)’ feels fear! All stats decreased by 30%.]

 <p>
  “This guy…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Fortunately, I took a step forward. The spear’s shaft swept past where I was standing.
 </p>
 <p>
  That guy, he got too excited. He didn’t swing his spear around wildly like that in the training ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was about to say something
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly-
 </p>
 <p>
  “Pull yourself together!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna slapped Aaron’s cheek hard.
 </p>
 <p>
  A single stream of blood trickled down from Aaron’s nose.
 </p>
 <p>
  This battle was Aaron’s first real combat experience. Until now, he had only been a spectator from the sidelines. I understand. Both Jenna and I experienced fear during our first real battle as well. However, Aaron didn’t have a second chance.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you fail again this time, you die! Is that okay with you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t be disheartened.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I-I will do my best!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron’s spear started to find its target. The fear didn’t dissipate, but at least he managed to keep the harpy charging at Jenna away.
 </p>
 <p>
  After that, it was smooth sailing. Aaron and I took defensive positions to protect Jenna, while Jenna shot down the harpies and goblins one by one without any hindrance.

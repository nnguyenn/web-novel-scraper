 <p>
  The base capture process was over.
 </p>
 <p>
  We had gathered all the items needed for the subjection, and the party to kick off the mission was decided.

 <p>
  Han, Jenna, Velkist, Katiio, and Eloka.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, until the time for hunting came, all we had to do was sharpen and polish our swords.
 </p>
 <p>
  The next day, I gathered all members except Katiio at the training grounds.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Hehe.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka was smiling for some reason, looking quite pleased.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ignoring her, I continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Once the mission starts, we’ll lead the airship and find the statue of the goddess as quickly as possible.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “And then activate the goddess’s blessing, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right. With our current manpower, we won’t last long. The more we delay, the more disadvantageous it becomes for us.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Reviewing the logs of Anytng, we could see that there were 25 heroes available for the boss battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the same setup as the 30th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We have five bottles of Mermaid’s Tears. That means five of us will fight at the forefront. The rest will defend near the statue of the goddess.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I scanned the room as I spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The attacking team will be me, Jenna, Velkist, Neryssa, and Eloka. That’s how we’ll split up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is it possible to fight underwater? It won’t be easy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at Eloka.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Eloka, can you use level 4 flame magic underwater?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve gotten used to it on land. I can barely manage for 30 seconds. Underwater is… well…”

 <p>
  “Speak clearly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I, I can do it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Her response seemed uncertain, but as long as she could use it, that was enough.
 </p>
 <p>
  I explained the positions of the first party members.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist, Neryssa, and I would take the direct aggro of the boss in the front.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna would handle the minions likely to be near the boss and interfere only when possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally…
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re on the attack.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Me?”

  “Our damage is weak underwater.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even with equipment modifications and training, it was inevitable that our combat power would be reduced compared to on land.
 </p>
 <p>
  Magic, as long as the environment was right, could unleash its full power anywhere.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll create an opening, and then you use your magic. Can you do it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka hesitated for a moment, then nodded firmly with a serious expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not like there’s no room. Just maximize the specs within that time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I directed the training.
 </p>
 <p>
  We skipped all training regimes other than underwater training, allowing only the minimum necessary rest.
 </p>
 <p>
  The training duration was about 20 hours a day. If it were in the waiting room, we could adjust the time, but we were in the middle of a mission. There was no time to rest.

  “Let’s start right away.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I stood up, gripping my sheath.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The most important thing is…’
 </p>
 <p>
  With Katiio excluded, the key to this battle was Eloka.
 </p>
 <p>
  She would be responsible for the primary attack of the first party.
 </p>
 <p>
  The training began.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka seemed to have learned basic swimming in the waiting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  She moved through the water easily, splashing around. But…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Magic is not that easy, okay?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “First of all, spells don’t work underwater. You have to keep your mouth shut. If you don’t chant spells it becomes very difficult to control elemental magic.”
 </p>

 <p>
  Eloka hurriedly added as I remained silent.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not that I can’t do it! I just need time, until I can perform silent chants.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I pulled up Eloka’s status window.
 </p>
 <p>
  She had mastered multiple chanting and rapid chanting.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her magic casting on land had noticeably sped up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve mastered the theory. I just need practice.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can do it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka confidently tapped her chest and entered the water.
 </p>
 <p>
  She practiced magic on wooden dummies underwater. But for now, bubbles were just bubbling around the dummies.

 <p>
  ‘For now, all I can do is watch.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I need to be able to play my part first.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clearing my mind, I dived into the pool.
 </p>
 <p>
  The red circle in the sea was gradually covering the entire field.
 </p>
 <p>
  The airship slowly retreated to the outskirts, and we dedicated ourselves to training day by day.
 </p>
 <p>
  Two days later, Jenna and I were able to rise to level 4 in underwater combat.
 </p>
 <p>
  After our skill level increased, we immediately measured our 100m time, and it barely broke the 40-second mark.
 </p>
 <p>
  World-record level. In a way, it was expected. As we approached level 30, we easily surpassed the limits of human physical ability. Diving with a handful of breaths became possible for up to 10 minutes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Late into the evening, after underwater practice, we dedicated ourselves to weapon skills training outside of the water.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”

 <p>
  I took a breath.
 </p>
 <p>
  Filling my lungs halfway, I gripped the hilt of my sword firmly and put strength into my toes. I swung the sword horizontally.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  A V-shaped column of water exploded upwards.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swinging the sword had created a storm-like air pressure.
 </p>
 <p>
  As my level increased, my physical abilities surpassed human limits, continuing to improve steadily.
 </p>
 <p>
  The same was true for skills. Various passive skills, including swordsmanship, had noticeably improved since my visit to Niflheimr.
 </p>
 <p>
  But…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is problematic.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I opened my status window.

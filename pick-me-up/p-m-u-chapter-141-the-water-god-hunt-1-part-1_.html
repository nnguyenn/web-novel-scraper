  Bubbling.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bubbles were dancing and twirling on the water.

 <p>
  Inside the swimming pool, Eloka was looking at her target with tense eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her hand moved.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack!
 </p>
 <p>
  Flames burst from the chest of the wooden doll, turning it into ashes in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  The blue flame, not satisfied with just burning the doll, flickered in the water for a few seconds before disappearing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Phew!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka emerged to the surface.
 </p>
 <p>
  She had a face full of pride.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How about that! It’s perfect even underwater.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The firepower seems a bit weak?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I deliberately controlled it. The target is small, after all. It’ll be different in actual combat.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What about the magic efficiency?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can manage up to three times. After that, I’ll need to drink a potion.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing that I didn’t respond, Eloka looked at me anxiously with a changed expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s weaker than expected.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The flame magic I saw on the 20th floor wasn’t like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even in a near-death state, it swallowed a black dragon of several meters in size in one gulp.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, still, if it’s at this level, it’s passable.

 <p>
  It seemed like it could land an effective hit on the water dragon.
 </p>
 <p>
  She also confidently assured that she would increase the firepower in actual combat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So… we’re going together, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “When have I ever said we weren’t?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ve tricked me a couple of times.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even if you don’t like it, I’ll take you, so stop worrying.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka gave a playful laugh and then got out of the pool.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked around.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist was slashing the straw doll in the water.
 </p>
 <p>
  Somehow, that guy had also grown to be able to do his part.

  ‘The preparations are almost complete.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The red circle was already covering the entire sea area.
 </p>
 <p>
  By tomorrow evening at the latest, the hunt would begin.
 </p>
 <p>
  That evening, I called Edis with Iselle’s power.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How’s it going?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;The second party is pretty much ready. But the third party is the problem.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The third party was a group of beastmen.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was Kishasha’s party.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;They seem to suffer severely from seasickness. They haven’t learned to swim either. It’s said to be a race trait.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Race trait.”
 </p>

 <p>
  Indeed.
 </p>
 <p>
  They have superior physical abilities compared to ordinary humans on land but receive penalties in other aspects.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t too far-fetched considering the rules of Pick Me Up.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;No matter how much we teach them, they just can’t learn it. Kishasha has barely managed to learn the dog paddle, but it’s going to be tough in actual combat.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then stop teaching them how to swim. It’d be better to help them get rid of seasickness.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;We’re already making rafts to help with that.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  I nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like Edis was doing a good job.
 </p>
 <p>
  If we had more parties, excluding the third party would be the answer, but we don’t have the force to do that right now.
 </p>
 <p>
  We had to bring them no matter what. After all, we could fight even on the ship. I continued the conversation.

  “The call will come soon. Be ready and join immediately. This field is….”
 </p>
 <p>
  I shared the characteristics of the field I had deduced with her.
 </p>
 <p>
  The target of the subjugation was the giant water dragon. Edis was surprised to hear that it wasn’t affected by attacks above water, but she calmed down as the explanation continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;It’s similar to the 20th floor. We’re preventing the enemy’s intrusion. Right? And you’re attacking.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Probably.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;This time… it won’t be like the 20th floor. We’ve trained a lot.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “That was just an accident.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Responding to Edis’s determined words, I laughed and replied.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s end the call here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Got it.&gt;

  After I gestured, Iselle withdrew her hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle wiped the sweat from her forehead.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Phew!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good work.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s nothing. Loki, you can finish this mission in one go, right?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you talking about? If I can’t finish it in one go, I’ll die.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s true.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle coughed a couple of times and then looked at the door.
 </p>
 <p>
  [It seems like someone is outside.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Knock knock.

  Someone knocked on the door.
 </p>
 <p>
  After Iselle disappeared into the light, someone opened the door and came in.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was Priasis.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you busy?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was just about to go to bed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sorry if I woke you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I grabbed Priasis’s wrist as she was about to leave.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good timing. I had something to ask.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis hesitated for a moment and then looked at her wrist.
 </p>
 <p>
  I belatedly withdrew my hand. Priasis sat down on the bed.

  “…Ask away.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The ultimate goal of this mission isn’t to subdue the water dragon.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s to find the key. The water dragon is just an obstacle to that search.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems you’ll have to stay inside the ship this time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve heard that story about a hundred times.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll find the key. Just tell us its approximate location and what it looks like.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After a moment of hesitation, Priasis meticulously informed me about the key.
 </p>
 <p>
  I engraved the location and image of the key in my mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the next day.
 </p>

 <p>
  The weather was clear without a single cloud.

  All members of the first party were gathered on the deck.

  “Are you all ready?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ve done as much as we can, right, sis?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course. I won’t have any regrets. ……Maybe.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka trailed off as she looked at Katiio.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you’re not confident, mage, you can drop out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shut up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist gave a sneaky laugh and continued to polish his sword with a cloth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll distribute the potions. Drink them when I signal.”
 </p>
 <p>
  One bottle per person.

  I handed out the Tears of a Mermaid to the members.
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa’s share was to be kept by me. After reminding everyone of their positions and roles underwater, I looked to my right. Anytng was finalizing preparations for the sortie.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘1st Assault Team’ (Small) is being formed.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Party Composition – ‘2nd Party’, ‘3rd Party’, ‘4th Party’, ‘5th Party’]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Total Heroes – 20]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Leader of the Expedition – ‘Edis(★★★)’]
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis was the leader of this mission’s expedition.
 </p>
 <p>
  Being underwater, it would be difficult for me to oversee the overall combat situation. I wouldn’t have the luxury to command either.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a sensible choice.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng continued with the operation.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ‘Start Hunting’ button at the bottom of the screen was flashing white.

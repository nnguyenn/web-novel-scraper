 <p>
  Holding the statue of the goddess, I surveyed the opposite side where the airship and the water dragon were engaged in a chase over the swirling waves.
 </p>
 <p>
  “First, we need to regroup.”

 <p>
  I crossed to the other side of the waves and dashed across the water’s surface, ignoring the monsters that gathered. There was no time to look back.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a loud crash, I slid down as if sliding on ice, narrowly avoiding a water cannon shot over my head, powerful enough to sting my entire face. Had it hit directly, my head would have been obliterated.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Over there!” I pointed towards the outskirts of the field, a place where the water was still gently rippling. After hitting the water dragon with several ballista bolts, the airship moved towards the designated location. I increased my speed as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  A merman lunged at me from beneath the water with a spear, but I caught it with my left hand and yanked it, pulling the merman out of the water. Both the merman and the spear were sliced in half.
 </p>
 <p>
  With two leaps, I landed on the deck of the airship, which began to move again.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you secure the item?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Here it is.” I placed the statue of the goddess down.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Quite the sight to behold,” Velkist remarked with a click of his tongue.
 </p>
 <p>
  After securing the goddess statue to the railing with a rope, I surveyed the nearby waters. Since it was a deployable object, positioning was crucial, especially for a defensive battle. I also examined the control window of Anytng.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A rectangular field, huh?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, the best strategy would be to place it near a corner rather than the center to avoid having to defend from all sides.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, ‘1st Party’s leader, ‘Han(★★★),’ suggests to cancel the manual driving. Do you accept?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng hesitated for a moment but then made a decision.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes(Select) / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Katiio, you take the helm now. Drive this airship to the farthest corner of the field. We’ll install the goddess statue there.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio obediently entered the cockpit, and the airship started moving at a slightly slower pace. I grabbed the left ballista and diligently fired arrows at the pursuing water dragon.

  Although I couldn’t inflict damage, it was possible to slow down its pursuit. I spared no effort in firing the ballista.
 </p>
 <p>
  After about a minute,
 </p>
 <p>
  Thump!
 </p>
 <p>
  The prow of the ship hit something. It was a signal indicating to us that there was no further passage; it was a transparent wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned to look at Eloka, who stepped forward with a stern expression as the water dragon approached, coiling around in front of us.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I can do this.”

  Eloka muttered and then,
 </p>
 <p>
  【Inflare! Merge!】
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka’s dress fluttered as a flame, akin to the sun, erupted right in front of the water dragon.

  I opened the door to the waiting room, where heroes from the 2nd Party were being summoned one by one on the red magic circle.

 <p>
  “…Han.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis approached me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I nodded and then spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We don’t have much time. Listen carefully.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I had explained the basic details yesterday.

 <p>
  I informed them of the current situation and what the reinforcements needed to do.

  “That’s right. Take Priasis with you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll do my best!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A new member of the 2nd Party shouted enthusiastically.
 </p>
 <p>
  I said, “Head straight to the deck. A ship will be summoned.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I had already handed over the model ship to Jenna.
 </p>
 <p>

  Their expressions were grim.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha sighed and then approached me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I heard about the situation from the human woman. I’ll head out immediately.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m counting on you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This battle, I’ll leave it to you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The beastmen left the waiting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Summoning messages continued for the 4th and 5th Parties.
 </p>
 <p>
  I noticed some unfamiliar faces, likely new recruits.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sorry for being late.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa was the last to come out.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s there to be sorry about? Hurry up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa and I left the waiting room together and ran back to the deck.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘As expected.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Next to the airship, a wooden ship large enough to easily exceed 10 meters was rocking.
 </p>
 <p>
  A small bridge had been set up between the two ships, and heroes from different affiliations, including Priasis, were transferring under Edis’s command.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Farmer sir, let’s give it our all again!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lyman showed me a fist bump and disappeared into the ship.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The boarding is complete!”

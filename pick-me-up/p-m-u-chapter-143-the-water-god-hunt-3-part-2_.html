  &lt;…Alright.&gt;

 <p>
  Edis answered reluctantly.

 <p>
  I cut off the communication.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you’re going to mourn your fate, save it for later.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I pulled Eloka by the back of her neck.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our faces came closer.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I decided to put you on this mission. I’ll take the responsibility.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I forced you into this!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No one can force me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka’s eyes wavered.
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled slyly and then released my hold on Eloka.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka slumped over the water as if drained of strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Take it somewhere else.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna muttered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “W-What are you talking about.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka backed away, flustered.
 </p>
 <p>
  I laughed and then said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You seem to have spare energy.”

 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  “Look at the mission window.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked to the right of my vision.
 </p>
 <p>
  The mission’s objective window was displayed.

  Plunder or capture.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not extermination.
 </p>
 <p>
  It meant we didn’t necessarily have to beat the water dragon.
 </p>
 <p>
  Probably the water dragon is just a mid-boss.
 </p>
 <p>
  A guardian of the place where the key is located, something like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Just ignore it, steal the key, and hand it over to Priasis.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The standard would be to hunt the water dragon and then enter the key storage, but now that was no longer an option.

 <p>
  Survivors on the airship escaped the area.
 </p>
 <p>
  Monsters were swarming around the statue of the goddess. Recapturing it was difficult. To retake a territory once lost, in principle, several times the force was needed. Moreover, monsters were also swarming towards the airship.
 </p>

  [Mermaid’s Tears]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Oxygen Concentration – 100%]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A time limit, huh.’
 </p>
 <p>
  We had to drive into the water within a set time, steal the key, and return.
 </p>
 <p>
  I explained my plan to them. I knew the approximate location of the key. I had heard about it several times from Priasis.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can we do it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We have no choice.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s true.”

 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna rolled up her sleeves.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka also hardened her expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  Both seemed to have made up their minds.
 </p>
 <p>
  I nodded and then took a deep breath.
 </p>
 <p>
  And dove deep into the water.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The boss was injured.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Although we lost the statue of the goddess, we still had a chance to win.
 </p>
 <p>
  I moved my arms and legs, gliding through the blue waves.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna and Eloka followed behind me.

 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Oxygen is being consumed quickly.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A huge shadow appeared in the water.
 </p>
 <p>
  The water dragon. It had shown up as expected. The wound on its chest that had been ragged was halfway healed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna immediately drew her bow.
 </p>
 <p>
  The streamlined arrowhead lodged into its scales.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kuuooooo!

  The water dragon roared and approached us.

  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I gestured to the two of them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ignore it, that was the message.
 </p>
 <p>
  They nodded and briskly moved their feet.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘We can shake it off.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t as fast as before.
 </p>
 <p>
  Its tail and fins were torn.
 </p>
 <p>
  I put strength into my arms and legs and moved forward.

  The blue light twinkled.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was clearly visible even from a distance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bubble bubble.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna grabbed my collar and pointed behind us.
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned my head.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Mermaid Lv.38] X 32
 </p>
 <p>
  A group of mermaids was approaching.
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned my body sideways. A harpoon whizzed past.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Ignore them.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The two nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  We dodged the harpoons skillfully and moved towards the bottom of the sea.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Oxygen Concentration – 43%]
 </p>
 <p>
  A huge temple submerged in water revealed itself.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Of all places, here.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The depth was nearly five hundred meters.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not a place to dive carelessly.
 </p>
 <p>
  I landed on the roof of the temple.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Entrance is…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Not visible.

 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka immediately began casting.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘We need to protect her until it’s done.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Mermaids fell one after another to Jenna’s shots.
 </p>
 <p>
  I deflected incoming harpoons in front of Jenna.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Oxygen Concentration – 35%]
 </p>
 <p>
  The more violently we moved, the faster the oxygen was consumed.
 </p>
 <p>
  I relaxed my body, minimizing my movements.

 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  One side of the temple’s roof shattered.
 </p>
 <p>
  I signaled, and starting with Eloka, we began entering the temple through the hole in the roof one by one.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka first, then me, and Jenna last.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Jenna(★★★)’ has been afflicted with a bleeding status. Health decreases over time.]
 </p>
 <p>
  We landed inside the temple with the flow of water.
 </p>
 <p>
  【Move!】
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as we touched the ground, Eloka immediately gestured with her hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  Stones from the floor rose and blocked the hole through which water was pouring.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka gasped for breath.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We can buy some time. It won’t last long, though.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked around.
 </p>
 <p>
  The place we landed was a huge cavity the size of a sports field, and the inside of the temple seemed not to be submerged.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Oxygen Concentration – 28%]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Can we make it back with this?’
 </p>
 <p>
  We had consumed more oxygen than expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  Regardless, we had to think about that later.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked back.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna was hesitating on her feet.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How badly are you hurt?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not much.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Be honest before you get scolded.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A little…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna smiled awkwardly.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t the first time I’d seen that expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  When this kid feels guilty about something, she makes that face.
 </p>
 <p>
  I strode behind Jenna.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her left calf was deeply gashed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Sigh.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Hit by a harpoon?
 </p>
 <p>
  It hadn’t stuck in, but it seemed to have scooped out a chunk of flesh as it passed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “A potion will heal it quickly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It will heal, sure. If you stay still and don’t move.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can still fight, you know.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  The cavity shook violently.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;How dare you enter uninvited!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the water dragon’s voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ouch!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I sat Jenna down, then took out a potion and bandages.
 </p>
 <p>
  I opened the potion and poured it over the wound, then wrapped it with bandages.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can fight too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stop talking nonsense.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re being unusually kind.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I finished wrapping the bandage and took out a white potion.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mermaid’s Tears. I placed it beside Jenna.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why are you giving this to me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “For emergency use.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Eloka, you too…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m not staying! Stay here? I wouldn’t have come if that were the case!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah!!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka placed her hand on her chest.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If I did something, I will take responsibility. That’s the duty of a noble. You too! Since you called me! Behave like a gentleman and escort me to the end!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka brushed her hair back and laughed merrily.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her hands were trembling, though.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is…’
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled wryly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then let’s go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What about me?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll come back for you soon. Wait patiently.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Attention!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [This dungeon is designed for a 5-person party.]
 </p>
 <p>
  I brushed aside the message that appeared in my vision and moved forward.

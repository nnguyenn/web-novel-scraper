  As I wiped my sword blade with a rag, it quickly turned into a useless cloth. I threw it away.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘She needs healing.’

 <p>
  I approached Eloka, who was leaning against the wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took out the last potion I had. I uncapped it and brought it to Eloka’s lips.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Drink.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m fine.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I forced Eloka’s mouth open and poured the potion in.
 </p>
 <p>
  More than half of the potion overflowed, spilling onto the collar of her clothes.
 </p>
 <p>
  I lifted the hem of Eloka’s clothes and rummaged through her pockets.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was a stamina potion. I uncapped it and poured it into her mouth. This too spilled over.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What a waste.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t regret it. I chose to go with you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is that so.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I slumped to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Was I helpful?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Half of the corpses were charred nicely.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had asked for simple magic, but high-powered spells were cast several times instead.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s a relief.”

 <p>
  Eloka smiled weakly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her splendid dress was soaked in blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s a lot I want to say… but somehow, I can’t find the words.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Any last words?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka’s eyes dimmed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Last… words?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Speak. I’ll remember them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka’s voice faded away.
 </p>
 <p>
  Tears welled up. Blood leaked from her blue-stiffened lips.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”

  “If it’s hard, stay quiet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I continued speaking.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m sorry for always scolding you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Idiot.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Eloka(★★★)’ has returned to the bosom of the goddess. Her fighting spirit will be remembered forever.]
 </p>
 <p>
  I closed Eloka’s eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her body which was leaning against the wall, sank.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Idiot.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I admit it, I am an idiot.
 </p>
 <p>
  I underestimated this world.

 <p>
  I had never failed before, and every attempt led to success.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because I knew everything. I thought it would be okay to stray a little.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’m an idiot.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t Eloka’s fault.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was mine.
 </p>
 <p>
  For choosing Eloka instead of Katiio.
 </p>
 <p>
  For letting the water dragon breathe fire. For the ship catching fire.
 </p>
 <p>
  For everything leading up to this situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I staggered to my feet.

 <p>
  It wasn’t over yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  The door to the next corridor was open.
 </p>
 <p>
  I dragged my feet forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Should I use the weapon summoning?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Impossible.
 </p>
 <p>
  To summon a weapon during a mission requires three chances, but I’ve already used one, making summoning impossible.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had to solve the current situation on my own.
 </p>
 <p>
  Several chances to turn things around flashed before my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  I erased that sight. Looking back now would mean Eloka died for nothing.
 </p>
 <p>
  A purple light flickered in front of me.

  Anytng was waving a light stick.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course. That’s all you can do now.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  The ceiling shook once more.
 </p>
 <p>
  I moved through the corridor. Same structure as before. No difference.
 </p>
 <p>
  Except that someone next to me was gone.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did she call it breaking the limit?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The situation when I acquired Frenzy.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, this is what it’s come to.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as Jenna said.

 <p>
  That sensation.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I thought everything would be fine no matter what happened.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I had no thoughts other than eradicating the enemy in front of me.
 </p>
 <p>
  A cold fire was burning in my heart.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Skill Awakening!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han(★★★)’s ‘Frenzy’ has been upgraded by two levels! Lv.10 reached!]
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  I moved forward. Once again, the space expanded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boringly lacking in personality. The same type of holes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Grr, grrr, grrrr…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Corrupted Merman Lv.41] X 5
 </p>
 <p>
  Mermen appeared from behind a pillar.
 </p>
 <p>
  Their eyes flashed as they screamed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The exit closed again, and I recalled the appearance of the temple I saw from outside the water.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There are more few holes.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, it’s still too early for Frenzy…
 </p>
 <p>
  “No.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It doesn’t matter.
 </p>
 <p>
  I decided not to make such calculations.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whatever lies ahead, however many enemies remain.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Screaaa!”
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no hesitation.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han(★★★)’ has entered a Frenzy state!]
 </p>
 <p>
  A cold fire spread throughout my body.
 </p>
 <p>
  I gripped my sword tightly, spinning the blade.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>

 <p>
  Three mermen were sliced up at once.
 </p>
 <p>
  The blade, not losing its strength after cutting through flesh, sliced the entire pillar in front of me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Next.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Corrupted Mermen Lv.42] X 5
 </p>
 <p>
  Crash!
 </p>
 <p>
  My blade plunged from above.
 </p>
 <p>
  The mermen tried to block it with its weapon, but it turned into crushed meat as if hit by a hummer.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Corrupted Mermen Lv.42] X 13
 </p>
 <p>
  The cold fire that was coursing through me began to expand its territory.
 </p>
 <p>
  From under the skin to the muscles. From the muscles to the blood vessels. Fiercely raging throughout my body.

  This is not enough.
 </p>

  If it evolves like this, it will just become a simple higher-level skill.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Give me more.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s not enough.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han(★★★)’s ‘Composure’ has met the evolution conditions!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Like fruits thrown into a blender, bits of their flesh scattered everywhere.
 </p>
 <p>
  My body moved beyond its physical limit. Every bone in me screamed with pain, but I didn’t care.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Still not enough.’
 </p>
 <p>
  After all, I’m alone.
 </p>
 <p>
  If I don’t take this kind of gamble.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Squeal, squeeeek!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Mermen corpses and pillars were sliced and mixed together.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether they wield weapons, hide behind pillars, or flee.
 </p>
 <p>
  One strike per enemy was all that it took.
 </p>
 <p>
  Click.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bifrost reacted.
 </p>
 <p>
  The blade extended. Larger and wider. Heavier and more powerful.
 </p>
 <p>
  The weight doesn’t matter. The heavier, the better. It allows me to put more strength into it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  Just by setting it down, the sword stuck into the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hundreds of kilograms. Impossible to lift.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Then.’
 </p>
 <p>
  My muscles twitched.
 </p>
 <p>
  The structure of my skeleton distorted.
 </p>
 <p>
  My body began to transform.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, ‘Han(★★★)’s soul is in turmoil!]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Finally.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled bitterly.

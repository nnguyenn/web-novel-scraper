 <p>
  I clenched my fist.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hundreds of kilograms of iron were lifted into the air.

 <p>
  “Kieeeek!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A merman screamed and charged at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I stepped forward and swung my sword. The air split in half and the creature’s body was cleaved apart. The mermen behind him were thrown away and tumbled due to the sword pressure.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kyak! Kiaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaak!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shut up!!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  Five mermen were smashed into pieces along with a pillar nearby.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crunch. A sound of something twisting was heard. It wasn’t from outside. It was coming from inside my body.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Han(★★★) has been afflicted with a bleeding status. Health decreases over time.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The wound on my stomach widened.
 </p>
 <p>
  But there was no time to feel it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Such pain was trivial.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crunch. Squelch.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bones misplaced. Muscles twisted mercilessly.
 </p>
 <p>
  A pain as if being torn to shreds burned through my whole body.
 </p>
 <p>
  My body was splitting from the inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Corrupted Merman Lv.43] x 11
 </p>
 <p>
  They kept jumping out.

 <p>
  Good. I couldn’t handle it if I weren’t busy killing them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Come out more. If I leave my body like this, it will break down faster.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack!
 </p>
 <p>
  I moved the sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  One at a time. No. Two. Three.
 </p>
 <p>
  Scattered flesh and entrails, blood dyed the pit. The bodies of mermen rolled around like trash.
 </p>
 <p>
  The great sword shattered the floor, pierced through pillars, and carved deep marks into the walls.
 </p>
 <p>
  …Breaking the limit.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was already using several times more strength than my original ability.
 </p>
 <p>
  Every movement exploded with pain. A cold fire gradually heated, covering my whole body.

 <p>
  I couldn’t stop.
 </p>
 <p>
  If I stopped here, the path would close.
 </p>
 <p>
  I screamed silently and swung my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  And after an immeasurable amount of time.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Creak, creak…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I kicked the head of a merman that was groaning.
 </p>
 <p>
  The head shattered, spewing blood and brain matter. This was the last one. I looked around. Numerous bodies of mermen filled the cavity. None maintained their original shape.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Cough!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I knelt on one knee.
 </p>
 <p>
  My vision went dark briefly before returning.

 <p>
  I staggered to my feet.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t a rampage.
 </p>
 <p>
  I placed my hand over my heart. A violent thumping. It was beating wildly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…A skill that puts a strain on the body.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Temporarily grants explosive power to the body.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the risk is entirely paid by the body itself.
 </p>
 <p>
  Extremely fierce.
 </p>
 <p>
  I moved forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  My left leg started to numb, so I used the sword as a cane.

  I moved my foot towards the door of the opened passage.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Gurk!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A merman jumped down from the ceiling.
 </p>
 <p>
  I moved my left hand. A fist extended like lightning, smashing the creature’s head and shoulder in an instant. The one that lost its upper body collapsed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I staggered.
 </p>
 <p>
  A stream of blood flowed from my mouth. Adrenaline surged through my veins. I could no longer feel pain.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Not yet.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t over.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang. I banged my forehead against the wall.

 </p>
 <p>
  I started to feel my senses again.
 </p>
 <p>
  I moved forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon, the third cavity appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Creak.
 </p>
 <p>
  A pillar moved on its own and took the shape of a person.
 </p>
 <p>
  But it was only similar in shape. It was 4 meters tall.

  [Guardian Golem Lv.43 X 3]
 </p>
 <p>
  The golems approached me with shining eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  I silently turned my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Han(★★★) has fallen into an exhausted state. All stats decrease by 90%.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Again.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Skill, ‘Invincible’ activated!]
 </p>
 <p>
  A fist like a cudgel flew at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I firmly planted my feet. The great sword described an arc.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a loud explosion, the golem’s arm shattered.
 </p>
 <p>
  I inserted my fingers into the golem’s torso with my left hand. The leather glove tore, and my fingernails peeled off, bleeding. I ripped out the magic stone inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  Two more golems attacked from both sides.
 </p>
 <p>
  I clenched my fist. There was no escape.
 </p>
 <p>
  No, I didn’t want to escape.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘More strength.’
 </p>
 <p>
  My vision turned red.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Skill Awakening!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hero ‘Han(★★★)’s ‘Rage’ and ‘Calm’ have merged to create a new skill!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han(★★★)’ has acquired ‘Ascend(Lv.1)’!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  The upper bodies of the two golems were instantly shattered.

  Only their legs remained, staggering before collapsing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I barely managed to stand, planting the sword into the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  The consumption of stamina was more severe than expected. I rummaged through my belt, but no potion was to be found.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Not yet.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s not enough.
 </p>
 <p>
  I bit my tongue until it bled.

 <p>
  I limped through the passage.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not much left until the end.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Damn it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Every second, my whole body was breaking down.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t a consumption of mental strength. It was using my body to increase my abilities.
 </p>
 <p>
  The skill was too powerful for my current state to handle.
 </p>
 <p>
  But still,
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t over.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks to Combat Wrath and Invincible. Even if my body became a half-dead corpse, I could continue the fight.
 </p>
 <p>
  You pay the risk of using these skills after everything is over.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Roooar! Do you think I’ll just let it be!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The roar of the water dragon echoed through the temple.
 </p>
 <p>
  My ears were acting weird, or the creature’s voice sounded distant.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sense of reality felt remote, like dreaming.
 </p>
 <p>
  It can’t end here.
 </p>
 <p>
  If I can’t handle even this…
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I lifted my head.
 </p>
 <p>
  I entered the cavity. Blue crystals protruded here and there.
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the cavity, on the altar, something was emitting a blue light.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Warning! Warning! Warning!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack!
 </p>
 <p>
  The crystals covering the wall shattered, merging into one in the center of the cavity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eventually, a giant figure took form around the crystal.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Danger!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ancient Guardian Lv.61]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The second boss, huh.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I planted the sword and leaned my body on it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Just once.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The limit of my body.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Inom!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  One side of the cavity was breached, revealing the head of a water dragon.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seawater began to fill the cavity.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;I’ll kill you!&gt;

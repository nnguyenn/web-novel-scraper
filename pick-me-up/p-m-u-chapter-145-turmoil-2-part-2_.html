 <p>
  One side of the cavity was breached, revealing the head of a water dragon.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seawater began to fill the cavity.

 <p>
  &lt;I’ll kill you!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The water dragon’s massive mouth approached as if to swallow me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Simultaneously, a crystal golem rushed towards me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I lifted my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Just once.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I stepped forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ground caved in and then cracked like a spiderweb.
 </p>
 <p>
  I gripped the sword with both hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  My grip was so tight that my hands bled.
 </p>
 <p>
  Durability was unnecessary.
 </p>
 <p>
  Stamina was unnecessary.
 </p>
 <p>
  All I need is a single moment of explosion.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kraaaaaaaah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The water dragon opened its mouth wide.
 </p>
 <p>
  I moved my hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Every organ in my body rallied its strength to its limits for a single devastating strike.
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t think about what would come next. 100%, 200%, 300%. Even beyond.
 </p>
 <p>
  I put my soul into this ultimate strike.

 </p>
 <p>
  Crack.
 </p>
 <p>
  Every bone in my body shattered.
 </p>
 <p>
  All the veins in my body burst.
 </p>
 <p>
  My vision turned as red as blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Skill Awakening!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hero ‘Han(★★★)’s ‘Heavenly Sword Spirit’ and ‘Power Strike’ have combined to create a new skill!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han(★★★)’ has acquired ‘Soulblade Fusion(Lv.1)’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  I swung my sword sideways.
 </p>
 <p>
  Following the trajectory of my sword, my blood slowly scattered, and the blade collided with the creature’s teeth.

 </p>
 <p>
  The great sword pierced through the teeth, scales, outer skin, entrails, and shattered the brain.
 </p>
 <p>
  The body of the water dragon, tens of meters long, was split in half with a single strike. Then the golem behind it was hit. As the sword hit the golem’s transparent surface, blue flames sparked.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack!
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘High-Intensity Force Field Shield’ ignored!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The guardian’s divided upper and lower bodies scattered to the sides.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom! A column of water belatedly shot up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  Blood poured out from the water dragon’s corpse like a waterfall.

 <p>
  The shattered crystal golem’s body didn’t move an inch.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s over.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I exhaled.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then I collapsed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon examining my body, it was damaged beyond description.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t a technique of sacrificing flesh for bones, but a technique of sacrificing flesh to take the enemy’s flesh as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘……How absurd.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Utterly ridiculous, indeed.
 </p>
 <p>
  I crawled on the ground. Using only my arms, I climbed the stairs to the altar and snatched the glowing blue gem at the center.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was the end.

 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Han, what happened? Are you okay?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis’s voice was heard.
 </p>
 <p>
  I closed my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Water began to fill the cavity.
 </p>
 <p>
  “O…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oppa!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I opened my eyes.

  Someone was shouting in front of me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please come to your senses! What are you doing here?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What happened to you? What are these wounds? What happened that Sis Eloka is……!”
 </p>
 <p>
  She must have seen Eloka’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna couldn’t continue her words.
 </p>
 <p>
  I lifted my immovable arm with difficulty and handed the gem to Jenna.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Take this to the surface and hand it over to Priasis. The mission will be over then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “And you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I…… don’t think I can come.”

 <p>
  There’s only one mermaid’s tear.
 </p>
 <p>
  I don’t think I can swim.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even speaking was difficult.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can you stop saying this!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna snapped.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m sorry.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now’s not the time for apologies!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna took out a potion, uncapped it, and tried to pour it into my mouth, but more than half spilled out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna bit her lip hard then filled her mouth with the potion and pressed her lips to mine.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This.’

 <p>
  I hadn’t thought of this method.
 </p>
 <p>
  The potion flowed down my mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really, really, really!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I really won’t forgive you if you die. I’ll go to hell myself to bring you back. What are you doing, saying I should be careful and then doing something like this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna took out a red cloth and began to tie me to her back.
 </p>
 <p>
  I squinted my eyes. The red cloth was a piece of Eloka’s dress.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Living people should live, you shouldn’t have such bad thoughts.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna took out a white potion.
 </p>
 <p>
  The mermaid’s tear. This time, she uncapped it and was about to fill her mouth with it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……Hey.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just give it to me. I’ll drink it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…You should have said so from the start.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna placed the potion into my mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  I coughed but managed to swallow it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you think dying with style will make anyone happy? Hell No! Sis Eloka…..”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll talk about that later.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The water rose just below the altar.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Living people…… must live.”

 <p>
  Jenna wiped the corners of her eyes and then tightened the cloth that tied her back and me once more.
 </p>
 <p>
  After emptying her portion of the potion, Jenna took a deep breath and dived into the water with me. I weakly watched Jenna’s back.
 </p>
 <p>
  ……Boom.
 </p>
 <p>
  The entire temple began to collapse.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna, carrying me, swam through the water, dodging the rocks and debris being swept away.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Oxygen Level – 39%]
 </p>
 <p>
  I moved my hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  I loosened the cloth tying Jenna and me so I could fall away easily if she reached her limit.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka’s sinking body appeared among the bubbles.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pushed out of the temple, she was being sucked into the deep sea along with the water dragon’s corpse.

 <p>
  ‘Is she going to rotten there.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In the deep sea where no one would come.
 </p>
 <p>
  Slowly disappearing.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘……’
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t want to leave her there.
 </p>
 <p>
  The taste of blood was bitter.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna struggled upwards.
 </p>
 <p>
  She couldn’t gain speed. Her legs hadn’t fully healed, and she was carrying a large burden on her back. Nevertheless, Jenna bit down and continued to swim.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka’s body disappeared into the abyss.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna didn’t look back. And just as I was about to completely untie the cloth, a vague shape swam down from above.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were moving their arms and legs swiftly, coming towards us.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They’ve come out… to meet us.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Light began to enter my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Foolish. How really foolish.
 </p>
 <p>
  I closed my eyes.

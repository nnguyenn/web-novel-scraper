 <p>
  The entire square began to tremble.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a phenomenon that occurred when the facility was being constructed. Arms crossed, I waited for its completion.

 <p>
  Shortly after,
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Tactical Base has been completed! The ‘Tactics’ tab will now be available.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, from now on you can use tactics!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tips/Tactics can be used in a limited manner within missions.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [※Notice!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [About Tactics]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Activate tactics by touching the ‘Tactics’ button at the bottom of the screen. You can give specific signals to your heroes.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You can use it freely at the beginning of a mission, but once you fully dive into the mission, penalties will be added. Use your limited opportunities carefully. As you level up the Tactical Base, more diverse functions will be added.]
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked to the right of my field of vision.
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the waiting room, a new facility had been established.
 </p>
 <p>
  A small room with a miniature table and a map. It was the Tactical Base.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng was checking the help guide.
 </p>
 <p>
  It would be hard to understand it all at once. It was quite complicated.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’m not sure how this will go.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Tactics can become a godsend, deciding the success of a mission if used correctly and at the right moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  But that’s only when used well. Across all of Pick Me Up players, there are few masters who can properly utilize tactics.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It depends on whether you can grasp the flow of battle or not.’
 </p>
 <p>
  How the mission flows, what’s dangerous, and what’s needed.
 </p>

 <p>
  If you don’t know these things, it’s no more of a pearl necklace on a pig. It would be fortunate if you didn’t just throw your party into disarray.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, most masters are so used to blankly staring at the screen that they fail to grasp the essence of the mission. The trend these days was to leave the Tactical Base unused and entrust the strategy to the heroes.
 </p>
 <p>
  I recalled the situation on the 35th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  One party fought the boss underwater, while another party was repelling a monster wave on the boat. Then, an accident happened.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that time, Edis couldn’t command properly. A hero’s vision is limited compared to a master’s, likely too preoccupied with blocking the monsters in front.
 </p>
 <p>
  If there had been a Tactical Base then, and if I had been the master at the time, the situation would have changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once the mission starts in earnest, tactics are greatly limited.
 </p>
 <p>
  At best, you might be able to display an arrow or a gathering indication.
 </p>
 <p>
  But even just giving a retreat signal could have greatly reduced the sacrifices.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…If only I had realized it sooner.’

 <p>
  Something might have changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  We might not have lost.
 </p>
 <p>
  I tried to take on everything in the mission by myself.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘We could have quickly retrieved the non-combatants.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, Eloka…
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I shook my head.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was already over.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tactical Base, huh. What a useless thing to make! Are you trying to cause trouble?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle was grumbling while looking at the screen.
 </p>

  She didn’t seem to like Anytng’s actions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why so? You said you’d do it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The master just watches from above. What would you know about the field?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I used to think the same.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s different with Loki. Tactics should only be used by Loki. A sparrow trying to follow a phoenix will only tear its groin. Just leave it to Loki to figure it out…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sorry, but I’ve changed my mind a bit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […Huh?]
 </p>
 <p>
  I stood up from my chair.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ignoring Iselle, who was looking at me with blank eyes, I left the personal training room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang! Clang clang!

 <p>
  In the sparring area, Velkist and Neryssa were fervently crossing swords.
 </p>
 <p>
  Both were bleeding but didn’t care. The fight was intense enough to be called a real battle. I glanced over briefly before stepping out into the square.
 </p>
 <p>
  The door to the Tactical Base was installed on the left side of the rift of space.
 </p>
 <p>
  I walked down the stairs and entered the facility. A circular table with a white map was placed inside. I sat down in the chair in front of the table.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s test your skill level.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I flicked my finger.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, ‘Han(★★★)’ proposes a mock battle. Would you like to accept?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  Mock battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  A kind of mini-game that becomes available after installing the Tactical Base.
 </p>

 <p>
  There are two players. Each plays as heroes and monsters, respectively. The mission and flow are similar, and through mock battles, you can check and train your tactical skills.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes(Selected)/ No]
 </p>
 <p>
  After a moment of contemplation, Anytng touched ‘Yes’.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ba-dum!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Starting the mock battle!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Type – 1 VS 1: Battle against artificial intelligence]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Artificial intelligence, huh.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I smirked wryly and prepared for the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Now Loading…….]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Configuring the map.]
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-7" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  The map on the table changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  A square model field was created, with black and white pieces appearing on both sides.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Black pieces are monsters, white pieces are heroes.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The rules are simple.
 </p>
 <p>
  The monster side aims to destroy the stronghold, and the hero side defends it.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, monsters and heroes are basically moved by AI. The player can only make a few signals before and after starting the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Field configuration complete!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, you are ‘Heroes’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The mock battle will start shortly. Get ready!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [60 seconds to game start!]

 </div>
 <p>
  The map on the table was completed.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like I was the one playing from here.
 </p>
 <p>
  Next to the map were a red pen and a blue pen, tools for tactics.
 </p>
 <p>
  I examined the map.
 </p>
 <p>
  The stronghold was in the center. There’s an object on the left side.
 </p>
 <p>
  The monster formation seems to start from the bottom of the field.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike when I was a master, it was analog, but still a familiar method.
 </p>
 <p>
  For the first game, I decided to use basic tactics.
 </p>
 <p>
  Easy to counter. Dividing the forces in half and deploying them to the object and the stronghold. I divided the black pieces on the map, then circled them and drew arrows to indicate the direction of the troops.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This mini-game could get deep if you delve more into it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The type of field is random.
 </p>
 <p>
  The effect of the object is also random.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each troop is divided into three professions, each with different abilities.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are numerous variables, and since professions, formations, and strategies bite each other, among the masters of Pick Me Up, there are quite a few who delve solely into mock battles.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Consider it an honor.’
 </p>
 <p>
  You’re the only one receiving a 1-on-1 lesson from the champion of the International Mock Battle League.
 </p>
 <p>
  I started placing the pieces with a smirk.
 </p>
 <p>
  [10 seconds until the game starts.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Get ready!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The placement was finished.

 <p>
  [Game start!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud.
 </p>
 <p>
  The black pieces on the map wobbled and then started moving on their own.
 </p>
 <p>
  The monster-shaped pieces advanced as I had directed.
 </p>
 <p>
  And 10 minutes later,
 </p>
 <p>
  The first game ended.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm.’
 </p>
 <p>
  This is quite, surprising.
 </p>
 <p>
  I set up for the next game.
 </p>

 <p>
  This time, I decided to change the strategy.
 </p>
 <p>
  All-in.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ignoring the object and cramming all forces into the stronghold.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s a gamble, but if you’re clever, it’s easy to catch your opponent off guard.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Another 10 minutes passed.
 </p>
 <p>
  I set up for the next game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Again, I decided to change the strategy.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Game over!]
 </p>
 <p>
  And the result was in.

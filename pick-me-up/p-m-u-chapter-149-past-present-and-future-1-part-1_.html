 <p>
  Several days passed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng, who had received my advice, did not send a response.

 <p>
  However, it was clear that his attitude had changed. According to Iselle, there were signs that he had repeatedly watched the mission videos on his phone’s records. He had started to study on his own.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He has the desire to improve.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He didn’t seem to be playing mindlessly.
 </p>
 <p>
  This meant he had met the basic requirements to become a ranker. There were many masters who questioned why studying was necessary for gaming.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although immediate effects were unlikely for Anytng, it would improve over time.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was satisfied with this and devoted myself to training.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the daytime training center.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do we really have to go this far?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna looked troubled.
 </p>
 <p>
  She was holding a whip with thorns on it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s too harsh. I think it’s okay to ease up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t want to waste time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even so…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna’s complexion darkened.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the training center’s sparring ground, I was catching my breath, my upper body undressed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Next to me was a bathtub filled with a red liquid. It was filled with dozens of bottles of healing potions.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I need to build endurance.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a decision made to properly use Ascend and the Soulblade Fusion.
 </p>

 <p>
  The previous methods were not enough. A drastic measure was necessary. Thus, this was the method I had chosen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Repeating physical damage and recovery in the sparring ground where healing was ineffective.
 </p>
 <p>
  For this, I had raided the storage for a large quantity of healing potions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “To make me do this to my Oppa…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s no one else but you. You’re used to shooting arrows at vital points, but now you fuss over a few whip lashes?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is the best way. I don’t want to repeat the experience of level 35.”
 </p>
 <p>
  There were weaker methods.
 </p>
 <p>
  But they took longer and were less efficient. I had no intention of choosing my methods anymore.
 </p>
 <p>
  Reluctantly, Jenna nodded.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Hit with full strength. I’ll know if you hold back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned my back to Jenna and bit down on a gag.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The pain was real.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I recalled the appearance of the whip.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was made from animal tendons, with thorns on the end designed to tear flesh and muscle. It was closer to a torture tool than a weapon.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s okay.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The pain was unbearable.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, I did not want to taste the emotion from before ever again.
 </p>
 <p>
  I reminded myself once more.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  “Here I go!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The whip tore through the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack!
 </p>
 <p>
  Stars burst in front of my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Damn it…’
 </p>
 <p>
  The whip tore through the skin and muscles on my back, digging deep inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  I bit down on the gag.
 </p>
 <p>
  I could still endure it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Covered in blood with just one hit…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Effective indeed.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  I caught my breath.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hesitant at first, Jenna moved her hand again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ssssh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The second strike.
 </p>
 <p>
  My entire back felt as if it were on fire.
 </p>
 <p>
  It felt as though my skin had been completely peeled off.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It hurts more than I thought.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Sweat blurred my vision.
 </p>
 <p>
  I then gestured with my eyes. A signal to continue.
 </p>
 <p>
  The whipping continued. Three, five, nine times.
 </p>

 <p>
  I gathered my fading consciousness.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was just a preparation process.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nine! One more!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s enough.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why go this far…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked back.
 </p>
 <p>
  Beyond the metal wall, my bloodied back was visible.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Looks like it even reached the bones.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I immediately entered the adjacent bathtub.
 </p>
 <p>
  The potion began to seep into the wounds.
 </p>

 <p>
  “UUUUUGHHH!”
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, I couldn’t endure it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Spitting out the gag, blood flowed from my mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you okay?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Of course.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Just one set.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had to go through at least thirteen sets a day.
 </p>
 <p>
  If done correctly, I would possess great endurance and recovery ability.
 </p>
 <p>
  The time for mere sandbags had passed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, training intensity suitable for a superhuman physique was needed.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-12" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 </div>
 <p>
  Next.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  A log hung from steel ropes was swinging back and forth.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was being shaken by a mechanical device.
 </p>
 <p>
  “One. Two.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I timed it, then squeezed between the logs.
 </p>
 <p>
  A giant log, meters in length, approached head-on. I lowered my body and swung my wooden sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  It felt like hitting a truck.
 </p>
 <p>
  The actual impact was probably no less.
 </p>
 <p>
  I endured.
 </p>
 <p>
  I added strength to my hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  Trying to maintain balance, my feet slipped.
 </p>
 <p>
  The log that pushed me started swinging back and forth again.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What kind of training is that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist, who had been watching, spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked down at my grip. Blood flowed from a torn spot.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s to build resistance. Training to block the logs with a wooden sword rather than breaking them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “To my eyes, it seems nothing short of madness.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It might seem that way now.”
 </p>

 <p>
  I had to let a shockwave of several tons pass through my body.
 </p>
 <p>
  I could smash it head-on and destroy it, like annihilating a ballista. But that would defeat the purpose of the training. It was all about sensing and skill.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Either way, it takes a long time.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The phase of immediately recruiting heroes was over.
 </p>
 <p>
  Recovering the power lost at level 35 would take time. Whether through paid or free draws. I had to simultaneously refine missions while raising levels and skills to the appropriate level.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is it time to move on to the next phase?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng must be feeling it by now.
 </p>
 <p>
  The need for a more systematic structure had arisen.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was time to flesh out the operations.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, that too would ultimately require time.
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  I planned to continue my personal training until Anytng made a decision. Reforming the attack party, and creating a new system, it would all be futile without the master’s will.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Don’t make me wait too long.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I gripped the wooden sword tightly and leaped in front of the log.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some time later.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Skill Awakening!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han(★★★)’ has acquired ‘Regeneration(Lv.1)’!]
 </p>
 <p>
  After repeatedly enduring torture, I finally acquired the desired skill.
 </p>
 <p>
  Regeneration. As the name implies, it was a skill that enhanced the body’s natural healing abilities. However, since it had little correlation with physical endurance, I did not stop.
 </p>
 <p>
  Every evening, I served as a sparring partner for Anytng.
 </p>
 <p>
  Several days passed, and Anytng’s skills had improved to beginner level. Although not exceptionally talented, his enthusiasm was evident. He seemed to be studying hard.

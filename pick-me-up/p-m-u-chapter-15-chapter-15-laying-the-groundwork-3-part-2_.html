  “Can we finally say goodbye to days of baked potatoes?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If there’s a dining hall, things might improve a little.”

 <p>
  It won’t change drastically, but it will be better than now.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna jumped up and down in excitement. Aaron also seemed to be in a decent mood.
 </p>
 <p>
  What just happened could be considered as a reward for their victory. They will likely benefit greatly from the tips.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If we fight harder, can we eat expensive dishes too?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “As long as it doesn’t seem useless to the Master.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll settle for the finest steak!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m satisfied with turkey, Hyung-nim!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Both of their faces lit up.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the other hand, I remained cool and composed. Seeing me expressionless, they started to subtly observe my reactions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron spoke up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you have any bad news?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just remember that if any seemed useless to the master, it gets discarded. Got it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  They nodded their heads.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t forget that. That’s all.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll keep that in mind, Hyung-nim!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll work harder too!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Looks like 3-star heroes will start appearing soon.”

  Maybe even 4-star, or perhaps even 5-star.
 </p>
 <p>
  Currently, we are in charge of the main strategy party in this waiting room, but that’s only because there aren’t enough people, and it can change at any time depending on circumstances.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the summoning portal.
 </p>
 <p>
  The door of the summoning portal was always ready to open.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even now.
 </p>
 <p>
  And sure enough.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, initiating a 10-consecutive summon. Exciting to see which heroes will appear!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna, who noticed the open summoning portal, raised her voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, the portal opened, Oppa?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems we’re done being the leaders; now it’s time to welcome the guests.”

 <p>
  It’s not a paid summon yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a common summon using gold.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tak-kak, doodoo-doo.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tada!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Common!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master ‘Anytng’…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Common!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master ‘Anytng’…”
 </p>
 <p>
  After a while, ten men and women walked out into the plaza.
 </p>
 <p>
  By now, after seeing this phenomenon happening more than twice, it didn’t seem odd anymore.
 </p>

  They noticed us as they wandered around the corner of the plaza. A man with a shaved head approached us.
 </p>
 <p>
  “W-Who are you? Did you bring us here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  An anxious expression. His voice was trembling.
 </p>
 <p>
  The reactions are all the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna said in a bitter voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not us. The person called the Master summoned you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Master? Who is that person? A magician?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Something like that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “And who are you? Why did we come here? Send us back immediately…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please calm down.”
 </p>

 <p>
  I rubbed my temples.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ve heard the same thing so many times; it’s giving me a headache.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, you why are acting like we’re bothering you? Tell us who brought us here!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have no intention of explaining it to you right now. You wouldn’t believe it anyway. Figure things out on your own. When you come back to your senses later, you can find me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “W-What are you talking about! Who are you…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I said, be quiet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I slightly unsheathed the blade from its scabbard. The man’s face stiffened upon seeing it.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were unarmed, while we were armed with swords, shields, bows, and spears. The man couldn’t utter a word and turned away.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’m not some kind of compassionate figure like Jesus or Buddha, and I don’t have the energy to explain things one by one.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hyung-nim…”
 </p>

 <p>
  Aaron seemed a bit troubled looking at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why don’t you go and try to persuade them? Tell them they have to fight monsters to survive? Do you think they’ll believe you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  They’ll have to experience it firsthand.
 </p>
 <p>
  By rolling their bodies, they’ll inevitably come to realize it, even if they dislike it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Welcome to the tower, chickens!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle appeared and stretched out her chest. It seemed like she was trying to impose a sense of intimidation.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was amusing to me, but not to them.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who are you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Be quiet and listen carefully. If you keep wandering off and murmuring, you’ll regret it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The crowd fell silent.
 </p>

 <p>
  Iselle looked satisfied, then raised her head and spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Any of you were carpenters?”
 </p>
 <p>
  A young man with an ordinary appearance raised his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You, go over there.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The young man silently moved to the left.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Next, anyone who was a blacksmith?”
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, no one raised their hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle lightly licked her lips and spoke for the last time.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anyone who was a cook?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I-I can cook!”
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-12" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  The middle-aged man who spoke to us raised his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then you go as well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The man rolled his eyes and walked towards where the carpenter was.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you doing?” Jenna wondered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re dividing roles. A dining hall needs a cook and a blacksmith needs a blacksmith, if a facility is created, it requires the appropriate personnel.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t help but recall the middle-aged man, Ryle, who was summoned during the first initial 10-consecutive summon. He was said to be the head of the carpentry workshop. If he had been summoned this time, he could have been assigned to the carpentry workshop.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the current situation, it’s like deciding your military occupation before enlisting.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you have talent in cooking, you become a cook. If you have talent in driving, you become a driver. Similarly, Iselle, who received the Master’s orders due to the newly established facilities, is assigning job classifications.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Haha, what a lucky bastard.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the young man who was silently surveying his surroundings and spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the carpenter and the cook Jobs gone, there were a total of eight remaining individuals.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Forming a party.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Drag and drop your heroes!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “‘Zeeth(★)’ joins ‘Party 2’!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “‘Hanson(★)’ joins ‘Party 2’…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “‘John(★)’ joins ‘Party 2’…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Open up, the rift of time and spacccce!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle said excitedly.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you don’t have any special talents,
 </p>
 <p>
  you’ll have to roll your body.

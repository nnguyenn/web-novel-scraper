  The next evening.

 <p>
  [Welcome to Pick Me Up!]

 </p>
 <p>
  The sky brightened.
 </p>
 <p>
  As always, Anytng logged in.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, there was an unfamiliar message below.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ding!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, you have 1 unidentified mail. Would you like to check?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng touched ‘Yes’.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Title – Additional Training Notification]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Sender – Loki (Niflheimr)]
 </p>
 <p>
  [We are contacting the masters of every top student of each training batch about our additional service. In this course, we plan to supplement the unfinished training, and your hero, ‘Han Islat’, has been specially selected due to his excellent performance.]
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a dispatch request sent by Yurnet.
 </p>
 <p>
  I don’t talk in such a stiff tone.
 </p>
 <p>
  I watched the situation with a smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The author requests the dispatch of the hero ‘Han(★★★)’. Do you accept?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng did not press accept.
 </p>

 <p>
  The additional training service for top performers.
 </p>
 <p>
  He must have had many concerns.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s obviously a lie.’
 </p>
 <p>
  What’s the point of doing something that doesn’t benefit me?
 </p>
 <p>
  Anyway, Anytng froze for several minutes with the mail displayed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unable to watch anymore, I stepped in.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, the hero ‘Han(★★★)’ requests to accept the dispatch.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng’s deliberation lasted for an hour.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do you accept the dispatch?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes (Select) / No]
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  Eventually, Anytng accepted the dispatch.
 </p>
 <p>
  For him, Loki was no different from a benefactor who sent valuable strategy documents and numerous pieces of advice. It would not be easy to refuse. There’s no need to refuse when they say they’ll nurture you.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He might wonder why.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He wouldn’t know until he finished the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as the decision was made, I gathered the members and announced the news. That I would be away from the waiting room for a while because of the dispatch. Jenna spoke first.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How long will it take?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It won’t take long. I’ll be back in a week.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t plan for a long battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna’s face brightened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re often away. Who am I going to fight when the senior is gone? Also, what’s good about that place?”
 </p>

 <p>
  “It’s a wonderful place. There’s a lot to learn.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna continued with a regretful tone.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I wanted to go to the additional training too…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s nothing special. Behave yourself while I’m gone. It’ll get busy again when I return.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m already busy. I’ll become stronger too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I finished exchanging words with each member and then informed Edis as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t meet Kishasha. I only saw the empty scenery of the forest that once served as the lodging for the third party.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll have to think about what to do with that girl.’
 </p>
 <p>
  That would be after I return.
 </p>
 <p>
  I packed my things. It was just bringing casual clothes, leather armor, and a sidearm.
 </p>

 <p>
  I probably won’t need to use any weapons.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Master, are you ready?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Early the next morning, Yurnet contacted me again.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s done. There’s nothing much to prepare.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;I’m looking forward to it. Just wait until tomorrow.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Ha.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She called because she needed me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t think of it as anything but a forced invitation for a good excuse.
 </p>
 <p>
  After receiving the report on the Union Guild’s power, my suspicions only grew bigger.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;It’s to minimize damage, Master. There are no other intentions.&gt;
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-6" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  “Alright, I get it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Have a peaceful night.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet’s communication was cut off.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked down at the desk. Papers where I had transcribed Yurnet’s reported contents were placed. Detailed powers of the Union Guild were meticulously written down, from the number of hidden factories to the class of ships, the number of elite heroes, noteworthy aces, and the main tactics used.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There’s one strange thing.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I pointed to the very bottom of the paper with a pen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the heroes affiliated with the Union Guild, there’s one exceptionally outstanding one. The sub-master of the Union Guild’s leader. The top commander on the heroes’ side.
 </p>
 <p>
  This hero infiltrated the core of the Bartz Alliance alone and wiped out its leadership.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mocking the escort forces of dozens, in essence, the Bartz Alliance, which once opposed the Union Guild, was annihilated by a single hero.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘According to survivors… a candidate for 7 stars?’
 </p>

 <p>
  Well, it was a common story.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even with the same grade and level, there can be a world of difference in a hero’s specs depending on their training.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seris was also under suspicion of being a 7-star.
 </p>
 <p>
  I briefly memorized the information and organized the documents.
 </p>
 <p>
  The details will be checked on-site. And then, I’ll decide how to respond.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anyway.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘We will win.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As always.
 </p>
 <p>
  The next afternoon.
 </p>
 <p>
  While I was reviewing the report once more, a message popped up with a sound effect.

 </p>
 <p>
  Due to yesterday’s dispatch acceptance, the rift in dimensions was automatically opened.
 </p>
 <p>
  Landgrid07.
 </p>
 <p>
  The model that transported me to Niflheimr the first time.
 </p>
 <p>
  I finished preparing and left the dormitory. After greeting the members who came to see me off, I went down to the second floor, where the rift in dimensions was located.
 </p>
 <p>
  [LOKIIII!]
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned back.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle was rushing towards me breathlessly.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Are, are you really going?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I forgot to tell you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [To Niflheimr? Are you not coming back? Are you leaving me and going…?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t make a fuss. I’ll be back soon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [But… .]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle looked sad.
 </p>
 <p>
  I placed my hand on her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll be back. Take care.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I entered the rift in dimensions.

  On one side of the airfield, a flying ship was waiting for me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Click, click. The stairs came down. I climbed the stairs and set foot on the deck.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, long time no see!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A girl in a black uniform saluted me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her name is Lydel. She was the same exclusive sorceress of the flying ship that had transported me before.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m sorry for not recognizing you last time, master!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lydel apologized in a lispy voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Yurnet must have revealed my identity to her.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, it doesn’t matter.
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled wryly.

  “Shall we depart?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll do as you wish. “Yes!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Vroom.
 </p>
 <p>
  Landgrid07 gently lifted into the air and began to approach the whirlwind of dimensions.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, the dispatch begins!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dispatched Hero – ‘Han(★★★)’]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Region – Niflheim (101.***.***.***)]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Duration – Undefined]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ding!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Landgrid07’ from ‘Niflheimr’ sets sail.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A message announcing the departure appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  I entered the ship and found a suitable room. I thought of taking a short break.
 </p>
 <p>
  I hadn’t slept much the previous day, analyzing the report.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ll arrive by dawn today.’
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Dimensional leap, initiate!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Ignoring Lydel’s guidance, I closed my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  How many hours had I slept?
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  I opened my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  With a loud noise, the hammock shook violently.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘……?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked out the window.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sky had darkened. It seemed like night had fallen.
 </p>
 <p>
  But… what’s this vibration?

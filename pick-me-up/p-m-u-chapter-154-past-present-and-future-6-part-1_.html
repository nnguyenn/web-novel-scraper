 <p>
  Uruka looked down at Siha’s corpse with a flustered expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, even after a few seconds, there was no movement—only blood soaking the ground.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Hey! Is this, is this some kind of joke?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Nihaku’s lightning is laden with various penetrations and curses.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a necessary measure to deal with monsters living above the 80th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  “She’s dead.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled lazily.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nonsense! Siha could come back to life even if torn into hundreds of pieces!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master, you don’t need to speak to him.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet stepped forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  A murderous gaze shifted toward the corpse.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How dare you wag your tail at our master.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a gesture from Yurnet, Siha’s legs disintegrated into particles and vanished.
 </p>
 <p>
  Complete annihilation. Uruka stared at us with a dazed expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet smiled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, when will the Union Guild show its real power?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Uruka bit his lip, then shouted as if in defiance.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This wench was just a figurehead for the Union Guild. I’ll show you my real power!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A book flew out from Uruka’s heart.
 </p>
 <p>
  The cover of the thick book was made of human skin. A sickening smell of blood emanated from the book.

 <p>
  ‘Hmm.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A grimoire, it seems.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had a rough guess of what was his profession.
 </p>
 <p>
  A necromancer, no doubt.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Rise!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Purple magic power emanated from Uruka.
 </p>
 <p>
  Simultaneously, corpses scattered across the bridge began to rise.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehehe… I’ll add you to my collection. Combining four of your corpses will be just perfect. Go, my immortal army! Feast upon them to your heart’s…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Disappear.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet swiped her hand.

 <p>
  The corpses filling the bridge shattered as if they never existed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Eh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Uruka staggered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Rise! Rise, I said! What, what the… Damn, what is this sorcery!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not really anything special.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, go to hell!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Black light emanated from Uruka’s fingertips.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before the magic could be fired, a flash of light sliced, and his right arm fell to the ground along with spurts of blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Gah, ah, ack!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Uruka writhed on the ground, clutching his severed arm.

 <p>
  Such a miserable end compared to his initial showdown.
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned my gaze away.
 </p>
 <p>
  Behind the blood-covered duo, a young man observed us without any change in expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Nord Lv.?]
 </p>
 <p>
  A question mark next to the name tag.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were two possibilities.
 </p>
 <p>
  Either he possessed a skill to hide his level, or perhaps…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is he the candidate for the 7 stars?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Surely, it’s him.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sub-master of the Union Guild and the sole infiltrator of the Bartz Alliance’s leadership, who massacred hundreds of heroes. According to eyewitness accounts, he overcame the resistance of high-ranking heroes, as easily as taking a candy from a baby.

 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, you! If it’s you…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Soaked in blood Uruka approached the young man.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, he grabbed his clothes in desperation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kill them all. The power of the Union Guild…”
 </p>
 <p>
  A smirk appeared on the young man’s face.
 </p>
 <p>
  His pale hand grabbed Uruka’s collar, and then a dark shadow rose behind him, swallowing his whole.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crunch, crunch.
 </p>
 <p>
  Spit.
 </p>
 <p>
  A few bones flew out from the shadow.

  “…It’s clear now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet smiled faintly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That hero is not an ordinary 6-star. You might not have seen it before, Master, but a 7-star can perform synthesis on its own.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you saying the thing he just did was synthesis?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridgion stepped forward, continuing the conversation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stand back. This might get a bit intense.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed.
 </p>
 <p>
  He didn’t seem like an ordinary hero.
 </p>
 <p>
  7-stars.
 </p>
 <p>
  The hero grade I so desperately wanted to have while playing Pick Me Up!

  I needed a specific item called the Reversed Heaven Scroll. I scoured every information site and searched every sector like hunting a mouse, but in the end, I never got it.
 </p>
 <p>
  That was one of the reasons I came here.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was related to the ultra-grade dungeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  But this guy, he felt different from the 7-stars I knew.
 </p>
 <p>
  I shook my head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Doesn’t seem like a 7-star.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It appears to be incomplete.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet replied.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked to the right.
 </p>
 <p>
  The One-inch TV broadcast had long been turned off. In the channel chat, all the masters except for the Union Guild’s leader had left.

 <p>
  Kaiser32.
 </p>
 <p>
  The nickname of the leader.
 </p>
 <p>
  I moved my hand to bring up the virtual keyboard and typed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Loki&gt; Where did this hero come from?
 </p>
 <p>
  Kaiser32&gt; None of your business.
 </p>
 <p>
  Loki&gt; If you don’t tell me, you die.
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as I finished typing, Nord’s eyebrows twitched.
 </p>
 <p>
  His blue lips parted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kuk, you’ll kill me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  His voice was like scraping metal.
 </p>
 <p>
  The emotionless young man’s expression became vibrant.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Fools, you’ll kill me? Merely data, and you think you can kill me? Ahahaha!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t you get it? I, who have obtained infinite power, cannot be killed by the likes of you!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Contempt and cynicism settled on the young man’s face.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, he stomped his foot. A dark red aura erupted from his entire body.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Danger!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Nord Lv.143]
 </p>
 <p>
  Nord’s right arm wriggled, transforming into a demonic mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  A maniacal laughter erupted from him.
 </p>

  “I’ll devour you!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  Just the act of stomping his foot shook the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  The next moment, his figure reached Ridgion. The demon’s mouth opened wide.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let me take a bite…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Slash.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nord’s right arm was severed.
 </p>
 <p>
  He continued his sinister laughter. And then the regenerated demonic right arm chased after Ridgion.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow, is this guy like a cockroach trio or what?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Nihaku loaded a golden arrow onto her bow.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Cockroach extermination requires DDT, ya know.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I blocked Nihaku.
 </p>
 <p>
  A necromancer witch or something. An old necromancer who deals with corpses. And a demonic young man.
 </p>
 <p>
  A notably peculiar combination indeed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s watch a bit longer. We might get some information.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I agree.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Eh? But it’s boring…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Nihaku reluctantly dismissed the arrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Heh, haha! What leisure do you have! Soon, you’ll all be digested in my stomach!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even as his body was sliced and chopped, Nord continued to laugh maniacally.
 </p>
 <p>
  His body was a cycle of severing and regeneration.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Go ahead, cut more! Kill more! The more I am killed, the more complete I become!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master, I’ve brought warm tea and cookies. Coffee? Tea?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Coffee.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “As you wish.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A small table and chairs appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sat down and drank the coffee Yurnet had poured for me.

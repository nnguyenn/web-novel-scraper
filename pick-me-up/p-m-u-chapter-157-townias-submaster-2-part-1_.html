 <p>
  I could understand Velkist’s feelings.
 </p>
 <p>
  We are considered pawns on a chessboard. It was not merely an incorrect statement.

 <p>
  But it’s not a clear answer either.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, this was a different issue.
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as I tried to intervene between the two, Jenna raised her hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “May I speak?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist spoke disinterestedly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna lowered her voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t think the Master considers us disposable. Think about it. Whenever we wanted something, it was granted. The food is delicious, the beds are soft… And he even mourned the death of our comrade, didn’t he?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If the Master thought of us as nothing, he wouldn’t have treated us this way, remember what happened last time. When we rebelled. We all could have died, right? But we survived. It’s different.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist clicked his tongue.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna continued with a smile on her face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Maybe there’s a different reason why we are here. Saying it’s all because of the Master might be a bit off. Above all…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Like it or not, we have no choice but to help.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I spoke up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “As the two of you mentioned, the reason we’re here is related to the Master. But we can’t just ignore it. Remember what Iselle said, if we want to return, break through the 100th floor.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s also my opinion. If we help the Master, the benefits will directly come back to us. It will increase the success rate of our missions.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It doesn’t have to be so forced…”
 </p>

 <p>
  Jenna scratched her head, looking troubled.
 </p>
 <p>
  That girl had timely intervened, reminding us by mentioning the deeds of Anytng, making us think of a hero.
 </p>
 <p>
  That girl intervened at the right time. She spoke as if she were thinking of a hero, mentioning the things that Anytng had done to us.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That’s why welfare is important.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Caring for the welfare of heroes results in high morale and loyalty in return.
 </p>
 <p>
  Apart from the missions, ensuring each individual’s rights and freedoms was one of the things I concentrated on while managing Niflheimr.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m just saying that’s what happens if we help the Master. I didn’t say that I didn’t like it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis grimaced.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your words keep changing. Aren’t you ashamed?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Though we were kidnapped, we’re treated well. The synthesis was a thing of the past. If we want to go back, we need to break through up to the 100th floor. And the key to that lies with the Master. So, even if reluctant…”

 </div>
 <p>
  Edis looked at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a sign of implicit agreement.
 </p>
 <p>
  All that was left was Velkist.
 </p>
 <p>
  Everyone’s gaze turned to Velkist.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you all looking at. It’s bothersome.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Damn.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist spoke as if spitting out.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Fine, have it your way. Feels like I’m being pricked to death.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Any objections?”
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  No one answered my question.
 </p>
 <p>
  Only Velkist turned his head sharply.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That settles it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Somehow, we’ve crossed the threshold.
 </p>
 <p>
  If Anytng had indulged in synthesis and neglected welfare like other masters, the outcome would have been entirely different.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Cooperation it is.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Joint operation of the Master and heroes.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the banner I had raised in Niflheimr.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the other hand, we have the methods of the top-ranked master…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That method can only be digested by no one else.’

 <p>
  I spread out a crumpled paper.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, Han, what should we do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis asked.
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  The next morning.
 </p>
 <p>
  I went down to the training center on the first floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s been a while, Hyung-nim!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A familiar young man bowed to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dika. A member who was briefly part of the first party.
 </p>
 <p>
  He is now an active training instructor.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-6" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  “Have you been well?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. This role seems to suit my aptitude well. I am finding it fulfilling.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s good then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dika guided me to a seat.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sat down and looked around the training center.
 </p>
 <p>
  Several heroes were practicing weapon skills in the yard.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The heroes I trained…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I’m sorry.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not your fault, Hyung. It was my inadequacy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dika smiled bitterly.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-7" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
  <script async="" crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4984013611805253">

 <p>
  Then, Dika’s expression returned to normal as he spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hyung, what brings you here today?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Remember what I told you last time? To train up candidates for instructors.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, a few months ago…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, it was a few months ago.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, Hyung. As per your instructions, I ensured that each one could develop a specialty.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  The groundwork seems to have been completed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The training center has changed a lot.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The first training center was just a large rectangular room with training equipment scattered around.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-12" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
  <script async="" crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4984013611805253">

 <p>
  But now, buildings soared high beyond the yard.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed Anytng had built it while I was away.
 </p>
 <p>
  Good. Anytng understands what we need too. If that building hadn’t been there, I would have sent a mail asking to build one. That building will now serve as a school.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shall I call the candidates?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please wait a moment!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Shortly after, ten individuals lined up in front of me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Six men and four women. Dika cleared his throat and then said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Say hello. This is the person I told you about.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nice to meet you!”
 </p>
 <p>
  All ten bowed in unison.
 </p>

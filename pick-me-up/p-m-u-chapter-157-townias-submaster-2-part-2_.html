 <p>
  “Nice to meet you!”
 </p>
 <p>
  All ten bowed in unison.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Oh, we’ve heard a lot about you. We’ve also seen you fight!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Stone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, Master showed it to us.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Surprising.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was Anytng’s doing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Quite meticulous. Thanks to that, I’m skipping tedious processes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hyung, starting from the left, I’ll introduce them. This guy is Jess, he was a hunter before coming here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dika started introducing them one by one.
 </p>
 <p>
  The heroes gathered here were talented individuals in specific fields.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Swordsmanship, archery, spearmanship.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Basic weapon skill instructors, two for each category.
 </p>
 <p>
  Following them, four instructors to teach survival, hunting, infiltration, and other composite missions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They should be able to pull their weight in combat.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You paid attention to the recruitment criteria, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, only those with the talent to teach were called.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good job.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I examined each one’s status.
 </p>
 <p>
  Their levels were not high, but they excelled in skills in one area.

  ‘If these guys join the raid team.’
 </p>
 <p>
  We could recover our strength in less than a week.
 </p>
 <p>
  But that’s not an option. They are the cornerstone for the future of the training center.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Dika included. Eleven instructors.’
 </p>
 <p>
  One more person is added here.
 </p>
 <p>
  I called someone waiting outside.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shortly after, a middle-aged man with a bitter expression entered.
 </p>
 <p>
  A large build contrasting his wrinkled face, wearing worn leather armor, he was Roderick, the spearsman from the 2nd party.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I’m sorry.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No need to apologize. It’s something I asked for.”
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  I placed Roderick in front.
 </p>
 <p>
  “From now on, this person will be in charge of the training center.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Oh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s been a while.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Roderick’s appointment as head of the training center was strongly recommended by Edis.
 </p>
 <p>
  She said Roderick mourned unusually long whenever a comrade died. It was unbearable to watch. Additionally, he had an exceptional talent for teaching. Thus, after Edis persuaded him all night, it was finally settled.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This gentleman is retiring too.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He had been the frontline of the 2nd party for so long, never backing down.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having experienced real combat for a long time, he would perfectly compensate for the lack of experience among the other instructors.
 </p>
 <p>
  After organizing everything, I immediately entered the training center building.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  The building was three stories high.
 </p>
 <p>
  You climb up from the first floor of the waiting room to the third floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  The structure was all too familiar.
 </p>
 <p>
  It resembled the initial training center of Niflheimr.
 </p>
 <p>
  This part seemed to mimic the strategy document.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Pre-built.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A systematic system is necessary.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng must have thought similarly to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though the strategy document might have said so.
 </p>
 <p>
  With this, the conditions were met.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  The first condition for Townia to move to the next stage.
 </p>
 <p>
  Namely, specialized education.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even a naturally 1-star could grow like a 5-star, but that’s when the environment supports it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Top-tier talents might end up tilling fields or baking potatoes in a weekly dungeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  To not miss talented individuals, a solid educational curriculum was necessary.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since I’ve taught the basics, under Roderick’s leadership, the instructors will complete the Townia educational system. Naturally, its efficiency cannot be compared to when the heroes were training on their own.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The second is…’
 </p>
 <p>
  I went up to the second-floor square.
 </p>
 <p>
  The square, which should have been quiet in the morning, was filled with people.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oppa, over here!”
 </p>

 <p>
  A familiar voice called out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna was waving her hand next to the fountain.
 </p>
 <p>
  I approached Jenna.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I gathered them just as you said, Oppa.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There are too many.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Um. Is that so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, it’s fine.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I walked to the center of the fountain.
 </p>
 <p>
  About 20-30 heroes had gathered in the square.
 </p>
 <p>
  I cleared my throat and then spoke.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-7" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  “You are former public servants from Townia, correct?”
 </p>
 <p>
  They murmured among themselves, but no one objected.
 </p>
 <p>
  What I asked Jenna to do was to gather people who worked in administrative positions before coming to the waiting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  I received a paper.
 </p>
 <p>
  The origins of the people gathered here were recorded on the paper.
 </p>
 <p>
  From clerks to warehouse keepers, and librarians, a variety of professions were gathered. They were currently working in crafting or gathering jobs in the waiting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  “From now on, you will be doing something else.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just like in Townia. It will be a cushy job.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A middle-aged man stepped forward.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  Apparently, this man seemed to represent the heroes gathered here.
 </p>
 <p>
  I spoke while looking at the man.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Record everything in this waiting room accurately.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you mean?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The number of people and their levels, current jobs, and floors. The types and quantities of items in the warehouse. The current state of facilities. The daily yield of weekly dungeon materials. The daily production rate of the equipment factory, etc. Organize and write down everything that happens in the waiting room, without missing anything. When you’re done, report to me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What? Why should we do such a thing…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Heh, that’s because Han is the Master’s representative!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle appeared, spinning around.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fear appeared on the heroes’ faces.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, they had seen Iselle execute syntheses several times.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even now, lower-tier guys are occasionally synthesized.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Listen well. Just one word from Han to the Master, and you all could be gone.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle threatened, clenching her tiny fist.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t my style, but as long as the job gets done, it doesn’t matter.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you trying to do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna whispered in my ear.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Creating a fourth job in the waiting room.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The first was combat.
 </p>
 <p>
  Next, crafting.
 </p>
 <p>
  The third, gathering.
 </p>

 <p>
  The last, administration.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s too chaotic here. Needs organization.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Basic details could be checked through the Master’s control panel.
 </p>
 <p>
  But that wasn’t enough.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The basics of management are accurate information.’
 </p>
 <p>
  How much material comes in a day, how much money is made, how much equipment is produced, how much material is used. Addition and subtraction must be clear to estimate management costs.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Master decides policies based on this and directs the path forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  Delivering commands throughout the waiting room and ensuring their execution was also the job of administration.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were like public servants performing government tasks. Iselle has been handling administrative work until now, but it will gradually change.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The sub-master is the representative of the administration.’
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  I divided the people in the square, assigning each a section to investigate. I did not forget to bluff that they would be synthesized immediately if the investigation was inaccurate. They glanced at Iselle’s expression and left the square.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ahem, my power is this much. Even crying kids stop and run away.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re not entirely unhelpful.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s right, am am!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle nodded several times.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oppa, is it over with this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If only it were. This is just the beginning.”
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s an endless amount of work to do.
 </p>
 <p>
  Probably won’t be able to sleep until dawn today.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Ha.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I sighed and looked at the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dark and cloudy. The Master is not connected.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Lucky guy.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It took me a year in real time to get to this stage of Pick Me Up without any guidelines. I had to start over several times.
 </p>
 <p>
  Such orders were also given from the Master’s position.
 </p>
 <p>
  Naturally, the transmission is much less effective than direct communication.
 </p>
 <p>
  I went through dozens of trials and errors.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But you…’
 </p>
 <p>
  My stomach hurts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Your heroes do everything for you.
 </p>
 <p>
  I walked away, smiling.

 <p>
  After several days, the basic tasks were completed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The overhaul of the training system, the creation of administrative positions, and the clarification of rules.
 </p>

 <p>
  It was not yet perfect, but it was a section that needed to be refined over time. Well, anyway, the operating system would slightly differ from that of Niflheimr.
 </p>
 <p>
  But then.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  I was in my personal room at the lodging, arms crossed.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was late evening. Anytng had disconnected. It was the time when everyone would be asleep.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There’s one troublesome issue.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A report lay on the desk.
 </p>
 <p>
  The report detailed the exclusive lodging for the third party.
 </p>
 <p>
  Originally, five beastfolks were supposed to stay in that forest, but now only one lives there. The four others had all died.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It seems like Anytng tried to fill it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  This summoning that brought the twin mages, its original purpose must have been to replenish the third party’s ranks.
 </p>
 <p>
  But it did not turn out that way.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was, in a way, expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  The chance of summoning a non-human species was extremely rare.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, what this lone survivor does now is.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nothing.
 </p>
 <p>
  The last time I saw Kishasha was exactly there.
 </p>
 <p>
  Standing dumbfounded in front of the columbarium that contained the relics of the fallen four.

 </div>
 <p>
  Since then, I never saw her again.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you look at Anytng’s operation window, it’s clear that it’s stuck in the exclusive forest most of the time. He rarely looks at others.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Sigh.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A sigh came out involuntarily.
 </p>
 <p>
  I understand the situation, but.
 </p>
 <p>
  After pondering for a moment, I got up from my seat.
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t just leave it. Kishasha was the only natural 4-star in the waiting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having fought her in person, I knew of her potential. If I leave her alone, the fate of losing her was clear to see.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if Anytng is reasonable, they wouldn’t leave a useless hero unattended.
 </p>
 <p>
  Silent protests don’t last long.

 <p>
  I put on the sheathed sword and armor hanging on one wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  After drinking my cold tea, I left the room. I swiftly exited the darkened mansion and went down to the plaza on the third floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I see you quite often these days.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I ran into Velkist on the stairs.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s the matter? At this hour.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I came to deal with a newcomer who seems promising. What brings you out here at dawn, senior?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m going to see Kishasha.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist stroked his chin.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If she’s sitting there, she’s nothing special, right? Just leave her. What you do with strength if your spirit is too weak.”

 <p>
  “Kishasha ended up like this partly because of me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You seem different from before, senior.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ve become kinder.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kinder?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll leave you to your babysitting. Take care.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist chuckled and passed me to go up the stairs.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t think so.
 </p>
 <p>
  The annihilation of the third party was indeed my responsibility.
 </p>

 <p>
  It was my decision to include Eolka in the mission. I was the one who dragged the third party, which only led to their demise. It was my mistake that needed to be repaid.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, if Kishasha had been a worthless hero, I wouldn’t bother doing this.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Kinder.’
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s just a hasty assumption.
 </p>
 <p>
  I smirked bitterly as I stepped out into the third-floor plaza.
 </p>
 <p>
  Passing through the darkened plaza, I headed towards the lodging. If you walk for a while down the hall from the entrance of the lodging and turn right…
 </p>
 <p>
  Crunch.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sound of dirt and leaves being stepped on.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first time I came here, a noisy little one was hanging on my right hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now dead.
 </p>

 <p>
  I continued down the hallway.
 </p>
 <p>
  The metallic floor changed to dirt and grass.
 </p>
 <p>
  But there was no sign of life. It was hard to distinguish anything in the hallway, and only the chill could be felt from the once-fresh forest breeze.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It seems like it hasn’t been managed for a long time.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, there was no need.
 </p>
 <p>
  I moved forward, crushing the dry leaves underfoot.
 </p>
 <p>
  It didn’t take long to arrive at the exclusive lodging for the third party.
 </p>
 <p>
  The village in the forest.
 </p>
 <p>
  This place, decorated by Anytng for the beastfolks, now had no use.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once Kishasha’s treatment is decided, it will be demolished.

 <p>
  ‘It’s quiet.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A clear outline emerged from the darkness.
 </p>
 <p>
  The effect of the Night Vision skill. I walked down the forest path that stretched out from the center of the lodging.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kishasha.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I murmured softly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Beastfolks have exceptionally keen hearing.
 </p>
 <p>
  She must have heard me clearly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve come to pick you up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I know you’re there.”
 </p>

 <p>
  I stopped in the clearing of the forest.
 </p>
 <p>
  The branches and leaves rustled annoyingly in the wind.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Have you made up your mind? Come back. We need you for the mission strategy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……Mission.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned my gaze to the left.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the upper part of a large tree, within the dense leaves, a shadow flickered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s the point? All of my folks are dead.”
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no emotion in the voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How does helping you humans benefit me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You can revive them if you reach the 100th floor. You know that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is there a guarantee your words are true?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “None. But I think it’s a trustable word.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Huhuhu.
 </p>
 <p>
  A cold laugh echoed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I thought it would be okay at first. I am a worthy warrior of the Storm Tribe who went through the coming-of-age ceremony. I am the successor recognized by the Beast King.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right, you’re a warrior. So…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But no.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Go back.”
 </p>

 <p>
  As expected, this was the response.
 </p>
 <p>
  I closed my eyes for a moment and then opened them.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t blame you. It’s all my fault. My mistake led my folks to death. What pride is left for me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you know what will happen if you continue like this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I know. Yes, I know well. I’ll die. Just die. Maybe… that’s not such a bad end.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Pathetic.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I shook my head.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that time, that girl was shining.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the Kishasha here is just… a remnant?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Am going to be consumed by you? What an honor.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Really? And what are you going to do about it? Are you going to just sit there?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  No answer came back.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Yeah.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I had been expecting it in a corner of my mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s not the first time I’ve seen this. There have been several similar cases in Niflheimr.
 </p>
 <p>
  When heroes lose all their comrades in a party, they often end up like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, I tried not to end up like this from the beginning.
 </p>
 <p>
  To not be swayed by anything. To avoid giving affection as much as possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  But in the end…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is something.’
 </p>
 <p>
  People’s affection is sometimes strange.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even I can’t fully understand my own heart.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I understand, Kishasha.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Go back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t want to.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Click.
 </p>
 <p>
  I drew my sword from its sheath.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the darkness, the blade gleamed coldly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You cowardly b$tch.”
 </p>

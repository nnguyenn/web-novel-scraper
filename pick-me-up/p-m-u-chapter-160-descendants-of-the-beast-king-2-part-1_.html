 <p>
  I caught my breath.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha’s eyes were bloodshot, her eyebrows bristled, and her sharp claws peaked out.

 <p>
  Her vertically slit eyes gleamed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I could die with one wrong move.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A tingling sensation spread across my skin.
 </p>
 <p>
  I wiped the blood from the corner of my mouth and gripped the hilt of my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha’s nails shone chillingly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you sure you want to provoke me this much?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Bring it on.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “As you wish!”
 </p>
 <p>
  In an instant, Kishasha’s entire body seemed to press against the floor, and then she was rushing towards me in no time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her nails swiped at my heart. A graze would lead to near death, a direct hit would be instant death. Feeling the adrenaline rush through my body, I twirled my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  I forced my body, which was trying to back away, to hold its ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha continued with her next attack as if she had anticipated it. Her movements were still unpredictable as if she was leaping in every direction. However.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang! Clang Clang!
 </p>
 <p>
  Sparks flew. The blade of Bifrost repelled her nails without fail.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kicks, knees, elbows, I blocked and repelled them all. They were too fast to see properly, but I was familiar with this kind of movement. I’ve fought countless times against people faster than her.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Minimize movements.’
 </p>
 <p>
  By observing the start of a movement, I could predict the point of impact.

 <p>
  This was the ‘domain’ that Ridigion had taught me.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Move lightly. With the minimum necessary motion.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The sword trembled.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Absorb the impact.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Clatter Clatter Clang!
 </p>
 <p>
  A relentless barrage of ten consecutive strikes didn’t leave a single mark on me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha leaped to the other side to continue her assault, dazzling me with sudden stops and accelerations, all the while scattering her blade-like claws.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I drew my dagger with my left hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  I wasn’t used to fighting against dual blades, but it wasn’t impossible.

 <p>
  I deflected the claws targeting my heart and neck with the dagger, swinging my sword with my right hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha hastily retreated, but the blade grazed her white forearm, leaving a cut from which red blood flowed. A strike targeting the flow of her movements.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha bit down on her claws and shook her hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Were you hiding your strength?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I never hid it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmph!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha kicked off a tree stump and lunged at me from the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  I planted my feet firmly on the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘At this point.’

 <p>
  I couldn’t afford to miss it.
 </p>
 <p>
  This battle revealed that Kishasha’s initial power level was among the top of the four-star category. Moreover, her combat strength hasn’t faded at all since reaching mid-stage.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Her talent is also top-tier.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s regrettable.
 </p>
 <p>
  If both of us had grown normally, I would have been at a disadvantage.
 </p>
 <p>
  But I can be a bit underhanded.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Master, the most important thing in a duel is.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridigion’s voice echoed in my head.
 </p>
 <p>
  I know.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Observe the opponent.’

 <p>
  Kishasha’s form blurred, aiming her claws at my ankles.
 </p>
 <p>
  I stepped back and swung my sword. Kishasha rotated in the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  I swung again. And again.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Left. Left. Right. Up. Up. Center.’
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s no need to observe the entire movement.
 </p>
 <p>
  If I can just scan the core movements, I can handle any speed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Therefore.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Urgh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Kishasha (★★★★)’ has entered a bleeding state. Her health will decrease over time.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha staggered back.

 <p>
  I flicked my sword, scattering droplets of blood into the darkness.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ve become much stronger since then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve been through a lot.”
 </p>
 <p>
  My mindset has also changed a bit.
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled and threw my dagger away.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha deflected it as if it was nothing.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I guess the dagger has served its purpose.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, I won’t need it anymore.
 </p>
 <p>
  I let my sword hang at my side.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Transform.’

 <p>
  Click.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a mechanical sound, the blade of Bifrost extended.
 </p>
 <p>
  It transformed into a greatsword. It’s hefty weight. I gripped the sword handle shorter.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You are…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Before Kishasha could finish, I charged in.
 </p>
 <p>
  The greatsword moved diagonally upwards.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  The air screamed as if being torn apart.
 </p>
 <p>
  I pulled the sword back and then turned around, connecting a second horizontal slash.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!

 <p>
  Kishasha’s body flew far away, crashing into a thicket.
 </p>
 <p>
  She managed to block somehow, but it seemed she couldn’t handle the impact.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s a loss.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Killing Kishasha would be a waste.
 </p>
 <p>
  She’s the only one from the waiting room worth playing with.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna and Velkist are following, but they’re not there yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  I aimed my sword at the thicket.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not over yet, is it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Rustle.
 </p>
 <p>
  The thicket stirred.
 </p>
 <p>
  The shadow writhed.
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  “Kraaang!”

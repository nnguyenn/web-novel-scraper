 <p>
  Then she looked at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You know, it would be more beneficial for me to step down than Velkist. My role isn’t something only I can do. If it’s just reconnaissance, Jenna is there, and this beastwoman can do it too. So please remove me.”
 </p>

 <p>
  I sighed and then spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you step down on your own, you can never come back. Do you understand what you’re saying?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, I’m prepared.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There won’t be a place for you in other parties either.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I know.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Neryssa!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ignoring Velkist completely, Neryssa continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I know the waiting room work is busy. If you entrust it to me, I think I can handle it smoothly. Someone has to do it anyway.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Neryssa said.
 </p>
 <p>
  For me to focus on tower assault, someone needed to take over the sub-master duties. But this wasn’t the way I wanted it to happen.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Han, can I step down now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha stretched in the arena.
 </p>
 <p>
  Standing tall, I slowly nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is unbelievable.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Kishasha passed by, Velkist spat out.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You tell us to prepare for a selection match, and this is how it ends?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t let your emotions control your judgment. Efficiency comes first. It’s better for me to step down here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa spoke coldly.
 </p>

 <p>
  Then, with softened eyes, she looked at Jenna.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jenna can take over my role.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you teach me those weird things just for this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna looked dumbfounded.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sat down, crossed my arms, and plunged into thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  The worst possible way to form a party is to forcibly take along members who don’t want to be there.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’d like to talk to you alone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa spoke demurely.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That woman seems out of her mind. It’s not even worth listening to.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Clear the room.”
 </p>

 <p>
  I spoke in a low voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha was the first to leave, followed by Jenna, who had been contemplating the entire time. Velkist, who had been glaring at Neryssa until the last moment, left the training ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now it’s just the two of us.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa chuckled bitterly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you thinking? Suddenly saying you’re leaving.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not sudden. I’ve been thinking about it for a while.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You gave a whole speech about survival when you joined. What’s changed? I’ll say it again, it’s not over just because you lose to her. There are always opportunities. I’ll help you guys too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite that, Neryssa shook her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  She seemed to have made up her mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why?”
 </p>

 <p>
  “When I first arrived here, I couldn’t trust anyone. Everyone felt like an enemy except for myself.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa looked down.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just, my thoughts have changed a bit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t really get it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just as I said.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa took a few steps away from me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her deep blue hair swayed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If it were you, I thought… it would be okay to entrust the princess to you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa turned her back to me.
 </p>

 <p>
  Her collar slowly slipped down, revealing the curve of her shoulder and gradually the contours of her body.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That is…’
 </p>
 <p>
  On the curve of her waist.
 </p>
 <p>
  A strange pattern was engraved.
 </p>
 <p>
  It looked like a rose and emitted an ominous light.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is called the ‘Twilight Mark,’ a special technique of the Halkion family. It’s a magical pattern that compels absolute obedience to its master.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Besides, it has several other functions: physical enhancement, brain function improvement, shortening lifespan while maintaining youth, and… memory enhancement.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  “For some reason, the pattern remained even after coming here.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “I see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She had mentioned she was from Halkion.
 </p>
 <p>
  She didn’t speak highly of them.
 </p>
 <p>
  I said,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you still have memories from your lifetime?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Most of them came back to me as I leveled up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa redressed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The afterimage of the pattern lingered before my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa began to explain.
 </p>
 <p>
  She was originally a noble, but during a power struggle, her family declined, and she was sold into slavery. Then, she received a special curse from the Halkion
  <br/>
  family and was sent as a gift to the second princess of the empire.

  “Princess Priasis Al Ragna. She was my master. She didn’t treat me as a slave. She seems not to remember me though.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This world was created for the restoration of Townia, wasn’t it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Having her memories back.
 </p>
 <p>
  Denying it wasn’t an option now.
 </p>
 <p>
  I nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I thought you knew already. Although I had my suspicions.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa smiled slightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “When will the others learn the truth?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “After the 40th floor.”

 <p>
  Level 40.
 </p>
 <p>
  The restriction for 4-star promotion is lifted.
 </p>
 <p>
  I recalled my time as a Master.
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s a clear difference between 3-star and 4-star.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s not about game performance. Their attitude towards missions was different.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘4-stars know.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The common point between Kishasha and Shay.
 </p>
 <p>
  They knew the purpose of the mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike the current 3-stars, who are somewhat reluctantly carrying it out, they act with knowledge.
 </p>
 <p>
  The subtle difference is even felt as a master.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Time to explain will come.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It won’t be long.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just proving that what I saw directly is true will suffice.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was curious too.
 </p>
 <p>
  During the promotions to 2-star and 3-star, you only see sorry sights.
 </p>
 <p>
  They probably couldn’t understand what was being said.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the 4-star promotion will be different. There will surely be a clear hint.
 </p>
 <p>
  Wait a moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But what does that memory have to do with you leaving the party?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Cough.”
 </p>

 <p>
  Neryssa cleared her throat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If there’s a need to fight, you should try harder.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I am trying harder. I was originally responsible for miscellaneous tasks back home.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That sounds suspicious.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “To be frank, I want to conduct a personal investigation. If I remain in the first party, I won’t have any free time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Investigation?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There are several things that differ from what I know. Especially…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa furrowed her brows.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s nothing. I’ll tell you when I’m certain.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…?”
 </p>

  “Anyway, I hope you’ll allow it. Velkist is more useful than I am right now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you really think so, I can’t stop you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s a relief.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa smiled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t it pitiable? If that fool was kicked out after rolling around in the training ground all day.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He’s bound to lose.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Murmuring as if talking to herself, Neryssa left the training ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was left alone, flicking my foot.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The memories of a hero.’
 </p>
 <p>
  At this stage, it’s unknown.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not asking Neryssa for detailed contents of the memories she had is also due to the uncertainty.
 </p>
 <p>
  As I climb the tower, I will find out.
 </p>
 <p>
  ’40th floor.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon promotion to 4-star, the attitude of heroes changes slightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  4-star heroes can utilize the hero’s third ability, the engraving.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Anyway.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ve found a hero to take over the sub-master duties.
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa should do well.
 </p>
 <p>
  She belongs to the diligent type and meticulously handles the tasks she’s given.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s time to resume tower raids.’
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, more quickly.
 </p>

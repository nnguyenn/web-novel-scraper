 <p>
  Three days later.
 </p>
 <p>
  We were sitting on the waiting seats in the plaza on the first floor.
 </p>

 <p>
  It was early evening. Lights were on in the sky, and on the game screen to the right, Anytng was familiarly manipulating the waiting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Climbing, it has been a while.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna breathed nervously.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s not let anyone die this time. I’ll only trust you, Oppa.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t trust me. It’s burdensome.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll trust you too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I told you not to trust. If you get hurt, It’s not my fault.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I brushed aside Jenna and Kishasha’s words and looked to the side.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the corner of the bench, Velkist sat with a sullen expression, his legs crossed.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had been like that since Neryssa left. Well, he didn’t cause any trouble.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is the airship maintenance finished?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s perfectly done. Ready to deploy anytime.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  And so, we waited for deployment amidst a bit of silence.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Neryssa must be busy.’
 </p>
 <p>
  She wouldn’t have time to rest.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite having several secretaries, the workload was beyond imagination.
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as the foundation was established, Anytng summoned dozens of heroes at once. To submit each hero’s report to the master on time, she wouldn’t have a moment to spare. I wanted to help, but she made it clear not to touch anything and focus on the mission.
 </p>

 <p>
  Therefore.
 </p>
 <p>
  With some free time, I slightly reorganized the first party’s formation and matched our pace in the lower dungeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  One thing I could feel was Kishasha’s excellence. Not only is she outstanding one-on-one battles, but she’s unparalleled in a melee. It was worth the hassle to bring her along.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Personal training also paid off.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Following Ascend, I could now use the SoulBlade Fusion at least once.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was when output was at its minimum, but unlike before, I wasn’t hindered right after using it. I could maintain about 50% of my combat power. Of course, if used at full power, I’d be instantly knocked out.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I hope we get a normal mission this time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng’s work was also nearing completion.
 </p>
 <p>
  “On the 30th floor, it was a desert, the 35th section is the ocean. I have no clue what will come out on the 40th floor.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Whatever comes out, just do what we have to do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I tightly fastened the sheath of my dagger to my belt.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Get ready.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng brought up the deployment window.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Open, the Rift of space and time!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle appeared in the air and pointed at the door.
 </p>
 <p>
  The rift opened left and right.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Han, this time it’s the 36th floor. Good luck with the conquest!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thanks.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I passed by Iselle and entered the rift.
 </p>

 <p>
  One by one, the members of the first party followed me.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Climb the tower, save the world!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Main Dungeon: Current Floor – 35]
 </p>
 <p>
  ’36th floor.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A sub-stage for the 40th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  I waited for entry while making idle talk with Jenna.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s not something we’re experiencing for the first or second time.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The familiar sense is gone.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Two members.
 </p>
 <p>
  Suppressing the strange feeling, I accepted the light enveloping me.
 </p>

 <p>
  The sensation of floating wrapped around me, and then,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s a plain.’
 </p>
 <p>
  We were summoned to an unfamiliar plain.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are we, alright?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna’s eyes widened.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t a desert, ocean, or labyrinth. It was a normal field for a change.
 </p>
 <p>
  A plain in broad daylight. A cool breeze came down from the hill above.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s a bit hard to breathe, but not too bad.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, it’s a minor difference.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked to the left.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-6" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 </p>
 <p>
  [Mission Type – Raid]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Objective – Steal the designated goods!]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Huh?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  A different type of mission appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Raid? What’s this about?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just as it says.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked around.
 </p>
 <p>
  The plain was spread out wide, with grass and rocks here and there.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-7" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  However, due to the many hills, the horizon wasn’t visible.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed we were below a hill.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oppa, shall I scout ahead?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No need. We can see everything once we go up the hill.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I began to climb the slope.
 </p>
 <p>
  One by one, the members followed me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Han, I hear something strange.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha’s ears perked up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, she sniffed around.
 </p>
 <p>
  “And a strange smell.”
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-12" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
  <script async="" crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4984013611805253">

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  “What smell?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Iron and blood!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha did a somersault and started to sprint up the hill at a fast pace.
 </p>
 <p>
  Can’t stop her now. I followed her slowly. Kishasha was looking at the other side from the top of the hill.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…This is.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha’s eyes sparkled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There are a ton of humans. Too many to count.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, a lot.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I narrowed my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the foot of the hill in the vast plain, countless humans were gathered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Easily thousands by rough count. Numerous flags fluttered in the wind. The faint sounds of shouts and sword clashes hit my ears.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a war.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist spoke softly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The battlefield on the vast plain was hundreds of meters away. That made it even more visible.
 </p>
 <p>
  The two sides of the army clashed, grinding each other down.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soldiers armed with armor and swords wielded their weapons against the enemy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Cavalry trampled the infantry in front, and arrows from archers stuck in the horses’ heads. From above, the magic of flame and ice raged, coloring the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sounds of shouts and screams from the battlefield faintly echoed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where is this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t know. Does anyone?”
 </p>

 <p>
  I looked back, but there was no one who would know.
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa might have given some answers with her extensive knowledge.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the army that was gaining the upper hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  They had a silver background with a winged cross emblem on their military flag. They were overwhelmingly pushing the opponent with their superior numbers.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They have a lot more men.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I knew what the emblem meant.
 </p>
 <p>
  I saw it during the mission to rescue Priasis on the 15th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Was it the Goddess Cult?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The group that frantically tried to kill Pria, calling her a witch and whatnot.
 </p>
 <p>
  After escaping the city, they also placed a huge bounty on Pria’s head. Speaking of which…
 </p>

 <p>
  ‘Did she escape safely?’
 </p>
 <p>
  In the middle of the sea.
 </p>
 <p>
  There wouldn’t have been a boat to go to the mainland.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, she must have escaped safely.
 </p>
 <p>
  I shifted my focus.
 </p>
 <p>
  More importantly, what’s before me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The path seems blocked.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio withdrew his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  He seemed to have scanned below the hill with magical waves.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If the way is blocked… is it that invisible wall from before?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, a no-pass zone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Katiio and I talked, the war continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were already retreating. The right formation tried to pull back, but the left formation of the Cult army surrounded them like spreading wings, devouring them in the process.
 </p>
 <p>
  Tens of people died every moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  If they were a bit closer, it would be a spectacle of blood and entrails.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Horrible.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna remarked briefly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha’s eyes narrowed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nothing here to do. Let’s go back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned my gaze.
 </p>
 <p>
  We didn’t come here to watch.
 </p>
 <p>
  Let’s see, what else is there.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Bingo.’

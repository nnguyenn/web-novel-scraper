  <br/>
  I turned my gaze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We didn’t come here to watch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Let’s see, what else is there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘Bingo.’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A side road leading to the back of the battlefield.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A group of soldiers was walking down the road, leading several carriages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Cult Army Soldier Lv.21] X 87
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Cult Army Knight Lv.23] X 5
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Cult Army Mage Lv.25]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their name tags floated above.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tag color was red. A clear indication of being enemies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The other members seemed to have noticed the carriages too.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Looks like…”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I started to speak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Our target this time seems to involve this war.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “That means?”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Winning, isn’t it?”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There are many, though.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Velkist crossed his arms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Not them. I mean the battlefield over there.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I know. Thousands.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The battlefield was just a background for now.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But as we ascend the floors, it will change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So, are you scared?”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Nonsense. I like it. We’ve been doing trivial subjugation missions so far.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Good. Follow me. We need to move fast.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I descended the hill.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Human soldiers and knights were crossing the plain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hey, you know what we’re going to do, right?”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Kill them.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Good job, Kishasha.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s eerie, though.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jenna sighed but also strung her bow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Well, there’s no fool here who would hesitate just because they’re humans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We’ll ambush them. Don’t hesitate. Before they form up, take them down. Oh, also there’s a mage among them.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I’ll handle him.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Katiio said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Good.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I put my right hand on the sword sheath and my left on the dagger sheath.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I dashed down the dozens of meters of hill in one go. Pushing through the bushes, I chased after the back of the carriage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “…Eh?”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A soldier who was chatting at the back made eye contact with me.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He didn’t even have time to scream, grabbing his throat and collapsing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An arrow was lodged in him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Huh!”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The soldier next to him gasped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  My thrown dagger stuck in his forehead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I drew my sword.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They noticed us after that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s an ambush!”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Don’t panic! Arm yourselves and counterattack! How many are there?”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Fi, five!”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “What?”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ding Ding Ding Ding!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The emergency bell rang.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It doesn’t matter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Kyaah!”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kishasha leapt several meters high, landing on the carriage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her claws extended long.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hiick, that kid is…”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kishasha’s eyes slit vertically.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Climbing down the roof of the carriage like a snake, Kishasha’s hand wriggled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two soldiers’ upper bodies flew off, spraying blood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘I wish Eolka was here.’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In such a battle, there’s no one like her.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tsk tsk. I clicked my tongue and swung my sword. A dazed soldier was cut into pieces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hmph.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Velkist plunged into the midst of the enemies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His sword moved like a snake, skewering three people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Form up!”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ping!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A commanding officer with a splendid helmet drew his sword, but an arrow immediately lodged in his chest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jenna had climbed onto the carriage, sniping key targets. First, officers. Second, archers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Are you mercenaries?”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It doesn’t matter.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I swung my sword down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The soldier raised his iron shield, but when the sword stuck, the shield crumpled like paper. The impact broke the soldier’s leg bones.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hurk, ahahak!”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I ended his pain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘They’re no match.’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No one could withstand a single strike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sword broke and the shield shattered. It was like snapping chopsticks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In no time, more than ten corpses piled up next to me. Not a single one had their limbs intact.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Monsters!”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Don’t panic, fight! The Goddess is with us… Cough!”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Damn it!”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From the distance, a young knight in silver armor appeared.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I, the Silver Paladin, Kyle von Strauss, representing the wrath of the Goddess, have arrived! If you stand in the way of the Goddess, my fierce swordsmanship will strike you down!”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “…”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “You are…!”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The knight widened his eyes when he saw me.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He hesitated for a moment, then smiled triumphantly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hahaha! Finally, we meet.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hm?”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I let go of the soldier I was holding by the neck.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The soldier collapsed as if bewitched and didn’t get up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Do you remember? The great battle on the stairs. The sacred duel we had with our lives on the line! Finally, after 5 years. I, Kyle, the heir of the Strauss family, the Silver Paladin! I’ve never forgotten!”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “…What are you talking about?”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Huh, I’ll make you remember. Don’t you ache from the wound back then? This time won’t be easy. I’ll show you my secret technique. It’s called Heat Wave Slash…!”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thump!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The knight was sent flying by Kishasha’s punch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The knight, hit in the head, writhed on the ground before stopping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Do you know this guy?”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Velkist shook off the blood from his sword and asked.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I don’t.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Have I met this guy?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Was it on the 15th floor? I have no recollection of it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Well, it doesn’t matter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I turned my attention away from him and searched for other targets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The battle was already nearing its end. There was no need to form up. Dozens of soldiers were beaten without managing a proper counterattack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hurk!”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Demons, they are demons!”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A seemingly mage-like old man was lying down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blood flowed from his nose, eyes, and ears. Anti-Casting. One of the magicians’ specialties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reversing the opponent’s magic to cause a backlash in their mana. This old man probably collapsed without casting a single decent spell.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “No matter how much you struggle…”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A knight with a severed arm laughed weakly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Our victory. The tide won’t change! Oh Goddess, please watch over us!”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swoosh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I cut off his throat in one stroke.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This guy was the last.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “A Trivial battle.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Velkist sheathed his sword.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “They were too weak. It wasn’t like this before.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Maybe we’ve gotten too strong. Excessively… I mean.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Excessively?”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Almost like human weapons. It doesn’t feel real, though.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jenna touched her cheek shyly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Well, anyway.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘War, huh.’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I sat on the wheel of the carriage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around me lay countless soldiers and knights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I seemed to have a rough idea of this mission’s concept. Not a raid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A large-scale battle. Clearly on the disadvantaged side.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘Like that f$ckin game, Dynasty Warriors?’

  [I don’t want to quit.]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I closed the folder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Looking to the corner of my vision, Anytng was still fervently engaged in a mock battle with AI.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even though it was time to disconnect, he was still playing. If anything, it seemed like his playtime had doubled since that day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Once the basic operations were completed, he repeatedly engaged in mock battles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Continuously, until he exited the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘You lack talent.’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was still struggling in the lower difficulty levels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Looking at all aspects, from room operation to party formation and hero training, there was almost nothing remarkable about Anytng. At best, he was good at racing games. In other aspects, he was either average or lacking in skills.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘But still…’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Not wanting to quit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Not just because it’s fun…
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maybe he wants to keep playing for another reason.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is weird.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It reminded me of myself from before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘Except for the lack of talent.’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I had quite a successful career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Everyone called me mad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Just for a game. Are you sane? Are you throwing away reality for a game?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘It’s not just because it’s fun.’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I saw something different on the screen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I couldn’t pinpoint exactly what it was.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘It wasn’t really for Niflheimr.’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That was probably the difference between Anytng and me.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Niflheimr and its heroes were a kind of tool to test my limits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It might have felt like climbing a high mountain. The brutal missions of Niflheimr had forced me to exceed my capabilities time and time again. Up until just before coming here, I had played Pick Me Up! within the fixed notion of a game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘This guy…’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Similar yet different.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Different yet similar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘Interesting.’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had beaten astronomical odds several times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The probability that I would be summoned by Anytng. The chance that Anytng’s hand would slip and I would survive in synthesis. And the probability that Anytng wouldn’t quit. That he would decide to continue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Loki.]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “What?”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [What should I do? Should I accept the director’s proposal?]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Would you do it? You should have been backstabbed once or twice to know. Next time, just block that b$tch’s messages. I don’t even want to hear her name.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Then…]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I won’t quit, I have to see it through. What else is there?”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Afterwards, Iselle closed the proposal window from Tel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That’s the end of the discussion. I will never think about the change of master again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘I’m not sure if it’s good or bad luck.’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the difficulty of Townia had been easy, would this guy have thought like this?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Like many other masters, he might have quit without hesitation if he got bored of the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I chose to think positively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘He has willpower, at least.’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This mission is too hard for me alone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The master’s power was essential.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘Tactical Center.’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If you’ve built a facility, you should use it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If my view of the hero is two-dimensional, the master’s perspective is close to three-dimensional, with multiple viewpoints. He can look down broadly from above and see different parts of the battlefield simultaneously.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘I don’t expect too much from the start.’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I’ll plan the basics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  You just need to give the orders at the right time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anytng was still not skilled enough to develop strategies on his own.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Perhaps he could, if he kept at it consistently.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In my experience, that process was more painful than enjoyable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was no longer a game to be enjoyed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Iselle. If you told me not to abandon the master, you must have a plan, right? Can you mess with the mock battle system? I want to change the map.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I directed my gaze to the desk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The map of the plains was almost complete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “When the mock battle starts, print out the map as it is. Leave the center empty, place three fortresses on the east, and two strongholds on the west.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I put on my coat and left the room.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anytng was reviewing a replay after a disappointing defeat to a low-tier bot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iselle followed me with a stiff expression.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If this girl belonged to Mobius, what she was doing now is directly against the company. She overturned the plan of the company’s highest-ranking executive, the director.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘Has she already made up her mind?’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Otherwise, she wouldn’t have shown me that document.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I untied the sheath strap and handed it to Iselle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since the sword itself is a mass of interference power, it should be helpful.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Let’s try this!]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If it doesn’t work out, don’t force it. There are other methods.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iselle disappeared with a flash of light.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I walked down the dark staircase to the first floor. The tactical center was situated next to the rift of space and time. When I opened the door and entered, a familiar table and chairs were visible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The difference from before was that the map on the table was changing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A non-existent map was being created. While the field was being set up, I examined Anytng’s control window. It seemed like Anytng was looking at me, who had suddenly entered the tactical center.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘It’s been a long time.’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I muttered as I looked up at the sky.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Give and take. Even if I understood your thoughts, the basics haven’t changed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Master, ‘Han (★★★)’ proposes a mock battle. Will you accept?]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Conditions – ‘Warrior Statue (5,000G)’ 1 piece per round]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Yes(Select) / No]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [5,000G will be automatically deducted!]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anytng accepted as if he had been waiting, and the warrior statue was placed on the table.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I pushed the statue to a suitable place and dusted off my hands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The map was complete. I would arrange the hero formations. Anytng took the monster’s side.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘I need to guide the strategy.’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even a fool would understand the meaning after repeating it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of course, the mock battle continues after the third round. Until the perfect strategy is found.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I can’t clear it alone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even when I was a master. Although I couldn’t talk directly, I used to plan mission strategies with Seris and Yurnet. The means of communication was also through mock battles at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Para-bam!]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [The mock battle begins!]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  [Type – 1 VS 1: Battle against AI]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thanks to Iselle’s intervention, the monster formation in the mock battle was overwhelmingly advantageous.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If I defend and drag out the time, I win the game. In contrast, I have to split my meager forces and simultaneously attack strongholds and fortresses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘Figure it out.’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What this mock battle means.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What you need to do to be of help to us.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If you can’t figure it out, Loki has no choice but to appear. If you have any concerns, you can at least send an email and ask for consultation. The methods were endless.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Naturally, excluding the master was not among the methods considered within me.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘I’m curious.’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What will happen to this guy in the future?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After all of this, would he backstab and quit the game?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It’s not entirely impossible. Then I would really look like an idiot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Or…
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘A new ranker will appear in Pick Me Up.’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rapidly climbing the tower vertically.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The account difficulty being hard was not only a disadvantage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The more rugged the climb, the steeper the incline, the more the heroes grow to exceed their limits. Otherwise, they won’t survive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Again, I don’t expect much from you.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Just don’t give up and stay with us.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If that can be done.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ‘I’ll do the rest.’
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of course, it’s not free.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  You’d have to pay at least the ticket price.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I smiled and waited for the mock battle to start.

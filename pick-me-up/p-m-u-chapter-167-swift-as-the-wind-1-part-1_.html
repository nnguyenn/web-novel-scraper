 <p>
  Early evening.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our first party was gathered at the plaza on the first floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng was busy on the right side of my view, distributing potions and other consumables, checking the status of the party.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Haah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna inhaled nervously.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her lips trembled slightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We can do it. We can do it. Aya Aya, fighting!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna, fists clenched, looked around at us.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We can do it, right? We’ve worked so hard already! Since it’s the last time, let’s break through without any trouble!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, whether it goes well or not, it doesn’t matter, right? If we fail, we all go down together.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist grinned.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna puffed up her cheeks.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What a bad thing to say. Doesn’t anyone want to cheer up?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you want that kind of atmosphere, why don’t you go there? It seems like a perfect match.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist glanced behind him.
 </p>
 <p>
  There, the members of the second party were gathered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis was brightly smiling and patting the shoulders of his party members.
 </p>
 <p>
  And behind the second party,

  Numerous heroes were shoulder to shoulder.

 <p>
  [“Forming the first attack squad” (small).]
 </p>
 <p>
  [“Party Configuration – ‘First Party,’ ‘Second Party,’ ‘Third Party,’ ‘Fourth Party,’ ‘Fifth Party'”]
 </p>
 <p>
  [“Total Heroes – 25”]
 </p>
 <p>
  [“Raid Leader – ‘Edis (★★★)’]
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng had completed configuring the raid and entered the mission tab.
 </p>
 <p>
  The mission would start soon.
 </p>
 <p>
  A month had passed since the second attempt.
 </p>
 <p>
  We had been given five chances, and we had already failed twice more.
 </p>
 <p>
  Therefore, this was the last chance.

 <p>
  “…However.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t that we hadn’t gained anything from the failures.
 </p>
 <p>
  The strategy for this mission was already complete. We had identified every point and variable in the field and had figured out how to deal with them. The rest depended on whether or not the plan was executed properly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s up to you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked up.
 </p>
 <p>
  The plan to clear the 40th floor was conveyed through simulations.
 </p>
 <p>
  If Anytng messed up, we would be left there to rot.
 </p>
 <p>
  [※Caution!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [This mission requires five parties in a medium-sized task. If there aren’t enough party members, use paid or free summoning to replenish heroes!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [This mission has predefined vanguard and rearguard roles. If certain conditions are met, the rearguard can join the battle!]

 <p>
  Anytng pressed the challenge for the 40th floor, and the mission’s cautions popped up.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was similar to the 20th floor. The vanguard would enter first, followed by the rearguard. The difference, however, was that the vanguard couldn’t be changed. Like it or not, the first party had to go.
 </p>
 <p>
  It made sense.
 </p>
 <p>
  The loop had been discovered by the first party.
 </p>
 <p>
  Until the mission was cleared or everyone was wiped out, the target wouldn’t change.
 </p>
 <p>
  [※Caution!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [This is your last chance.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you fail this time, all heroes from the ‘First Party’ will be annihilated, and you will start again from floor 31.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can we do it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio looked at me with a worried expression.

  “If it seemed impossible, I wouldn’t have come. Just do as we discussed.”

 <p>
  “I feel like I came here for nothing, just to suffer.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s better than where you were.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s true.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio sighed deeply.
 </p>
 <p>
  I checked whether my dagger sheath was securely fastened and the end of my pouch was properly tied.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng’s preparations were almost complete.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally, a loud noise as the gate opened.
 </p>
 <p>
  Next to the gate, Iselle flapped her wings.

 <p>
  [“Alright, the rift is open. First Party, enter!”]
 </p>
 <p>
  I led the way into the spatial rift.
 </p>
 <p>
  The central mirror was already glowing. Following me, the members entered one by one.
 </p>
 <p>
  The second party and the rearguard were waiting in the plaza. Edis and I made eye contact.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis nodded at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our discussion had ended yesterday. There was nothing more to say.
 </p>
 <p>
  Only the real battle remained.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I might not be able to come back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The mission itself was extremely tough.

  If anything went wrong in the plan, it would be the end for all of us.

  [Main Dungeon, Current Floor: 40.]

 <p>
  [10 seconds until the door opens. Get ready!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Recording the mission. Play records will be preserved.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The tactical tab is active and available for use.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The countdown started.
 </p>
 <p>
  I leaned against the wall and closed my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Han.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In the silence, Kishasha whispered.
 </p>
 <p>
  I opened my eyes. Kishasha, on tiptoes, whispered into my ear.
 </p>

 <p>
  “If I die in battle, don’t leave me behind. I don’t want to be alone anymore… Ouch!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I pinched Kishasha’s cheek.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is nonsense a specialty of your species? Say something sensible.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have no intention of dying. We’re all going back alive.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course. We’re going back alive.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna smiled brightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist also flashed a cold smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  “When it’s time to fight, you’re fierce, but now you turn into a child? Aren’t you ashamed to call yourself a warrior? Don’t disappoint me or the first party.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha grimaced.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it. I won’t say such a thing ever again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s good.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist turned his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the same time, a dazzling light enveloped me.
 </p>
 <p>
  The flash of summoning. Once the light cleared, the mission would begin.
 </p>
 <p>
  I rested my hand on the hilt of my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve said it so much that I feel so tired. Is there anyone who still doesn’t understand?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It feels like I’ve heard that talk more than ten times.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve memorized it perfectly.”

 <p>
  “Me too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  That was expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  After finishing the fourth loop, I had explained the plan to the members several times.
 </p>
 <p>
  There must be no deviations. The timing of each member had to fit together like gears in a machine to properly complete the plan.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There can be no failure.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I slightly drew my sword from its sheath.

 <p>
  This was the fifth time we faced the plains field. The last loop had started.
 </p>
 <p>
  Three seconds into the mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud! A loud noise could be heard as the sky was lit with flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was magical artillery.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Move!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I immediately sprinted across the meadow.
 </p>
 <p>
  The members began their respective actions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Roar!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha roared loudly.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Unique Skill, Transformation Activated!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Kishasha (★★★★)’ transforms into a giant tiger!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Transformed into a giant tiger, Kishasha bared her fangs and ran towards the east side of the field.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The other four.’
 </p>
 <p>
  To the west.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just then, a supply convoy was heading towards the battlefield.
 </p>
 <p>
  We jumped right into the middle of the convoy.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You! I, the Silver Paladin, Kyle von Strauss, acting as the wrath of the goddess…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Enough already.
 </p>
 <p>
  I instantly cut off the neck of the one making a fuss.

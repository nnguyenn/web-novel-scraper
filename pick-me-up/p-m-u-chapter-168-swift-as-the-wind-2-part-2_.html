  ‘Quite troublesome.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t revive the experience from the 35th floor.

 <p>
  The water’s flow was too strong, even for water-walking magic to get through.
 </p>
 <p>
  Therefore.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Open!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Katlio drew a large circle with his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  An egg-shaped blue portal appeared, and following Katlio’s complex hand seals, the portal glowed and two figures emerged.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right here!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The twin mages of wind and ice have arrived!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Raine and Maine.
 </p>
 <p>
  The twin elemental mages from Party 2.
 </p>
 <p>
  The two, as if in unison, smiled wryly at me and began chanting in magical tongues.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;La Siudio Cru.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;La Undien Ne.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  A wind summoned by Raine’s right hand soared into the sky, while ice cast from Maine’s left hand fused with it. The twins smiled lightly and looked at Katlio.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Phew, really. Just kill me, kill me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katlio exhaled deeply and reached up to the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  Threads of magic intertwined with the cold and wind, weaving the two spells into one.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ding!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Combined Grand Magic, ‘Howling Storm (★★★★)’ has been activated!]

 </p>
 <p>
  Whooooosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s quite flashy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist commented.
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed, a swirling storm of dozens of meters in diameter was forming in the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  Combined grand magic. When mages of compatible elements weave their magic and spells together, they can cast much more powerful magic.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Charge!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Katlio pointed at the mage across the river.
 </p>
 <p>
  Simultaneously, a wall-like storm slowly moved forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good luck! We’re going ahead!”
 </p>

 <p>
  “See you later!”
 </p>
 <p>
  After finishing their task, the twins winked and disappeared back through the portal.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist exchanged a glance with me and immediately began running. I followed him. The storm advanced over the river, sweeping away the currents. It acted as a kind of shield.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That guy is immune to magical damage.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Ranged magic was ineffective.
 </p>
 <p>
  Therefore, we had no choice but to break through the river directly.
 </p>
 <p>
  We led the way with the storm. Although the mage cast various hindering spells, they were rendered powerless with Katlio’s support.
 </p>
 <p>
  Screech.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the end, the mage succumbed to Velkist’s blade.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Elapsed time.’

  103 minutes and 22 seconds.
 </p>
 <p>
  80 minutes left.
 </p>
 <p>
  I tossed away the watch.
 </p>
 <p>
  After all, whether it works out or not, this is the last chance.
 </p>
 <p>
  No need to check the time anymore.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No more… I can’t!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katlio collapsed behind me.
 </p>
 <p>
  His face was deathly pale.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good job. We’ll take it from here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……I’ll leave it to you.”

 <p>
  Katlio sprawled out on the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was where he dropped out. He had performed his role adequately.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The last point.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If we cross the river, a vast plain will spread before us.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike previous bases, there were no supply or archery units here.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just a barren field.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘……’
 </p>
 <p>
  I climbed a hill and looked down below.
 </p>
 <p>
  Two armies were entangled in a bloody battle, with the Cult’s forces glaringly exposed from behind.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The optimal attack point.’
 </p>

 <p>
  The best location for a surprise attack.
 </p>
 <p>
  With no defensive troops in sight, a well-organized attack could yield maximum effect.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Oppa, I’ve got it!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna’s excited voice echoed in my ears.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good job. Come back straight away.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;I’ll be right there!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The rest…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s up to you.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng’s screen was busily moving.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, when you really get down to it, it’s nothing special. Just issue an attack order at the right location. I had designed the strategy to minimize the burden on Anytng as much as possible.

  ‘Attack, occupy, and move on.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng’s role here was to guide the troops along the correct path.
 </p>
 <p>
  There would be various obstacles to the east, just like here, but I had found shortcuts. All that was needed was to lead the heroes to those positions. Edis would take over the detailed combat command.
 </p>
 <p>
  That alone was enough.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Object effect activated!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The dimensional wall is starting to get destroyed!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack.
 </p>
 <p>
  A fissure formed on the transparent wall separating us from the battlefield, like a crack in glass.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘One left.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I dusted myself off and stood up.
 </p>

 <p>
  From the north of the hill, Kishasha and Jenna were racing across the plain.
 </p>
 <p>
  Behind them, dozens of black knights were fiercely chasing the two.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Our last stand in this field.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The remaining role of Party 1.
 </p>
 <p>
  To wipe those bastards out. If left unchecked, they would enter the battlefield and disrupt Pria’s side. I put my hand on the hilt of my sword and opened the communication.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Edis, once the third statue is destroyed, the path to the battlefield will open. Join up and hold the defense line. Just keep the formation from breaking down.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;I’ll do my best. After all, if we fail, we die. We have the mages, and it seems doable. What about you?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll create havoc from the rear.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis chuckled lightly and ended the communication.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now I would only see her face after the mission was over.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They’re coming. Should we go to meet them?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist drew his sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right. Let’s go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  We slowly descended the hill.
 </p>
 <p>
  The knights on horseback charged, kicking up clouds of dust.
 </p>
 <p>
  Right in the direct path. If we collided head-on with the cavalry, it would be a massacre.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Ha.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I gripped my sword firmly.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had wondered before. I couldn’t cut through steel back then. So I had to use various tricks to deal with those clad in plate armor. How about now?
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoosh!
 </p>

 <p>
  The leading horses snorted fiercely.
 </p>
 <p>
  Their eyes were bloodshot and unfocused.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘All in one go.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I loosened my grip on the handle.
 </p>
 <p>
  I swung my sword, letting BiFrost hang low.
 </p>
 <p>
  Click. A mechanical sound was emitted as the blade expanded. A Greatsword was formed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The heavyweight climbed up my arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oppa!”
 </p>
 <p>
  From atop Kishasha, Jenna waved her hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  As I nodded, Jenna strung her longbow.
 </p>

 <p>
  The sound that shook the earth began to pound in my ears.
 </p>
 <p>
  Straight ahead.
 </p>
 <p>
  The leading knight swung his lance.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can’t use Ascend.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t rely solely on special skills.
 </p>
 <p>
  I swung my sword in full force, my muscles strained to their limit. The greatsword, cleaving through a horse’s head like butter, shattered the black knight’s lance and then sliced horizontally through the torso clad in plate armor. Unable to overcome inertia, the black knight flew meters before scattering blood and flesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kill them all!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I gritted my teeth and shouted.
 </p>
 <p>
  In that instant, Kishasha bit and chewed a knight’s face, while Jenna’s arrow pierced another’s throat. Velkist, who had mounted a charging horse, thrust his sword into the back of another knight.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Object effect activated!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Just then the third statue was destroyed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Destiny Break!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Crash!
 </p>
 <p>
  A sound like breaking glass emitted and the wall that had blocked the battlefield shattered into the light.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The mission has been updated!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Mission Type – Conquest]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Objective – Turn the tide of war!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The Black knights’ blood soaked my face.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the first time we had made it this far.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Are we supposed to win this?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The conditions were ridiculous.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite various tricks, the tactical situation was laughably unfavorable.
 </p>
 <p>
  A few could never turn the situation around.
 </p>
 <p>
  Such was the overwhelming disparity.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But still.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I thought of the members of Niflheimr.
 </p>
 <p>
  The reason they were called true heroes.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Because they made the impossible, possible.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Now it was my turn.
 </p>
 <p>
  Amidst the sticky smell of blood, I smiled.

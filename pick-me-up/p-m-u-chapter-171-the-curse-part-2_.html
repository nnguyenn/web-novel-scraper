  Pluck.
 </p>
 <p>
  The crimson blood drew an arc.

 <p>
  Thud. The knight’s body split in two fell to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wow, scary. Did you see her expression just now? Gave me the chills.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna rubbed her arms.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked down at the knight. She lay dead with her eyes wide open.
 </p>
 <p>
  As expected, the capture was a failure. I relayed the news to Pria, who expressed her disappointment but thanked us nonetheless.
 </p>
 <p>
  “She’s dead.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Shortly after, Velkist joined us at the scene and spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist kicked some dirt over the woman’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this the end of the aftermath?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. It’s over. The mission clear should pop up soon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Our bodies were slowly becoming transparent.
 </p>
 <p>
  I cleaned the blood off my blade and sheathed it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Rest well tonight. The promotion to 4-star probably starts tomorrow. A lot will change.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Once this mission was completed, Jenna, Velkist, and I would all reach level 40. The reason I attempted the new mission, the 41st floor, instead of going to the 39th or 38th floor was to level up at the same time.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The seal will be lifted, huh? How do we get it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Exploration dungeons are the standard, but there are many other ways. I’ll walk you through them gradually.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m sorry to say this to Kishasha, but I don’t want to turn into an animal.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She was a special case.

  Usually, an engraving is an extension of skills.
 </p>
 <p>
  Maybe it’s like a set of similar types of skills tied together. A few extra stats and bonuses are attached.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then Kishasha and Katiio also arrived at the clearing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio closed the knight’s eyes with a somber expression.

  When the light faded, we were back in the rift of time and space.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was late evening. Except for those dedicated to training, it was time for everyone else to be sprawling out and sleeping in their quarters. I issued the disband order to my members.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Traitor, huh.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking back now, there are more than a few suspicious aspects in Pick Me Up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Too many to count on both hands. Indeed, my being summoned here was nonsensical from the start.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Item Synthesis Begins!]

 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng was fully engaged in the promotion preparations.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pure elemental stones that come at a low probability from daily dungeons, soul stones made by grinding 2-star or higher heroes, and intermediate promotion stones mixed together. It was a formula for creating a 4-star promotion stone.

  [Synthesis Failure!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Materials Disappear…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Although failures were frequent, there was a substantial stockpile of materials.
 </p>
 <p>
  At least one promotion stone should be achievable. I headed to the mansion on the 4th floor. The other members had already gone up upon returning, so I was likely the last one.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ve worked hard on the mission.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Entering the hall of the mansion, a familiar figure greeted me.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was Neryssa, the acting sub-master. She bowed to me once.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why are you up? It’s late.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s something I need to discuss with you regarding the 4-star promotion ceremony.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She got straight to the point.
 </p>

 <p>
  I said with a grin.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry. I’ll tell you what I’ve seen.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you. There’s something specific I want to confirm.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s suspicious, I know.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Between 3-star and 4-star, there’s a significant gap in information.
 </p>
 <p>
  Tomorrow, what I’ll see will undoubtedly be distinctly different from the mysterious scenes I’ve witnessed before. The attitude of the heroes who have promoted to 4-star tends to change.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether it’s the content or the form, changes are definite.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It doesn’t really matter.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Frankly, whatever secrets this world holds are irrelevant to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  My goal is to climb to the top of the tower and return to Earth. After all, I’m not a resident of this place. As long as I do my job right, nothing else should matter.

 <p>
  But still… it would be better to know.
 </p>
 <p>
  Who knows how it might be helpful.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s going to get a bit busier.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Learning the reason for his summoning and the truths of Townia might throw them into some confusion.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not just Jenna and Velkist. Soon Edis, as well as Raine and Maien, and the other heroes will likely be promoted to 4-star. Their perception of being summoned from unknown places for unknown reasons to fight will change.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘You won’t forgive?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, the glare of the knight who had looked at me with bloodshot eyes came to mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  What could a dead person do, after all?
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled bitterly as I entered my room.

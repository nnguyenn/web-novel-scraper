 <p>
  This was where the emperor stayed.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had always wanted to see his face.
 </p>
 <p>
  I followed the carpet.
 </p>
 <p>
  How long had I walked?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Squeak!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Goblin Lv.?] x ???
 </p>
 <p>
  From beyond the left pillar, a group of goblins with green skin huddled together.
 </p>
 <p>
  A unique crying sound.
 </p>
 <p>
  Goblins that I had grown tired of encountering on the lower floors.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Why are they here?’
 </p>
 <p>
  They were monsters.
 </p>
 <p>
  I tilted my head as I passed by.

 <p>
  To the left and right of the carpet.
 </p>
 <p>
  Monsters that I had faced before and would have to face in the future were lined up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Their numbers were obscured by the fog.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dozens of different types of monsters.
 </p>
 <p>
  Humans, small species, large species, beastmen, birdmen, fishmen.
 </p>
 <p>
  As if at a fair, countless kinds of monsters were arrayed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Grr! Grrr!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Screech!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Groooo…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The sound of their cries was painful to the ears.

 <p>
  I frowned and continued walking. I didn’t understand the meaning. These were enemies of humans. Why were they gathered here closely?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I could understand why…’
 </p>
 <p>
  I muttered.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They’re scared.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was know-how gained from fighting various monsters.
 </p>
 <p>
  The cause was unknown, but they were scared.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was suffocating.
 </p>
 <p>
  I firmly stepped on the carpet as I advanced.
 </p>
 <p>
  How many minutes had I walked?

 <p>
  An ornate throne decorated with gold at the end of the red carpet caught my eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  The golden throne was empty, but at the large table in front of it, various humans were gathered. I scrutinized the man sitting at the head of the table.
 </p>
 <p>
  Draped in a golden fur coat, wearing a silver crown.
 </p>
 <p>
  With dazzling golden hair and eyes, his handsome face could have been sculpted. The young man caught my eye but looked away as if he couldn’t see me. Then he moved his pale lips.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Has everyone gathered?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Assinis family hasn’t arrived,” said the man seated to the young man’s left.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was wearing a lavishly embroidered red coat.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Head of the Halkion Family]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ricardo von Halgiraf Lv.???]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Huh?’

 <p>
  That guy…
 </p>
 <p>
  I vaguely remembered his identity.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That one!’
 </p>
 <p>
  The boss of the 20th floor, the Black Dragon.
 </p>
 <p>
  Surely, this was his human form.
 </p>
 <p>
  I hadn’t actually encountered him for more than a minute, but his appearance was clearly etched in my memory.
 </p>
 <p>
  I quickly scanned the table.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Head of the Halkion Family]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Head of the Shutenberg Family]

 <p>
  “Why didn’t the Assinis come? They were definitely called.”
 </p>
 <p>
  At the young man’s words, a woman in a navy robe narrowed her eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They say they will fight to the end.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “To the end… Wouldn’t be better to be together? This is why we had this banquet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you order it, even by force…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s fine. If death on the battlefield is their pride, let’s respect that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The young man smiled gently.
 </p>
 <p>
  His golden eyes scanned the table once.
 </p>
 <p>
  To the three family heads and beyond to the figures sitting further away.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Guardians of the continent.”

  The young man continued as if singing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you for your hard work so far. Your efforts will not be forgotten. Once, we spilled blood gambling on the fate of each race. But this time, just this time… we were able to be one. I express my gratitude.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The young man bowed his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kekeke! Shining human! It was fun fighting together!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master of Arcane]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Kurushakh Lv.???]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m sorry! If my masterpiece had been a bit stronger, things might have been different!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No. Your inventions were really terrifying.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huhu, thank you for acknowledging.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Lizardman bared his teeth and smiled.

  That guy…
 </p>
 <p>
  ’30th floor.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The one who controlled the giant golem.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I never thought I would fight on land in my life. But it was a pleasant experience. It was stimulating for my long life.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I also thank the tribe of the Water Dragon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehe, we’re going anyway.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The white-haired old man laughed heartily.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Water Dragon God]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ktaart Lv.???]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What?’
 </p>
 <p>
  [King of the Water]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Kiadni Lv.???]
 </p>
 <p>
  A middle-aged man with tiger ears waved his striped tail.
 </p>
 <p>
  The man bared his fangs and smiled broadly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We fought a lot. It was fun!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, the young man’s gaze moved to the corner of the table.
 </p>
 <p>
  A group in wide robes and silver armor stood there. A winged cross symbol on a silver background. I had seen it several times. It was the symbol of the Goddess Church.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Blind Saint]

 </p>
 <p>
  [Silver Flash of Versace Lv.???]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Ha.’
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Church also did a great job. Although we did not receive the help of the goddess, your faith allowed us to maintain our pride to the end.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s nothing. I’m just sorry.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The girl in a white robe smiled with her eyes closed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you to the Cult Army and the Knights as well. I will not forget.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The knights all bowed their heads to the young man.

  “Now! This is our last banquet. Our Townia, until now, has been divided by different races and ideologies, shedding countless blood. But this time, just this time… we were able to be one.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ultimately, we have lost. Now our homeland will burn, and we will fade into the dark old pages of history. Or, Townia itself might disappear. But we… we did our best.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The young man raised his golden cup.
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now I seemed to understand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Where this place was.
 </p>
 <p>
  What it was trying to show me.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The past.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Before Pick Me Up was created.
 </p>
 <p>
  The scene just before the destruction of Townia.
 </p>
 <p>
  And while everyone here wore satisfied smiles, there was one.
 </p>
 <p>
  A girl, holding back tears, unable to contain her anger, biting her lip.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Second in line for the throne]

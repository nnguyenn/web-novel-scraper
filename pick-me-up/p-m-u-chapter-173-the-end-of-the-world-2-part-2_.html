  “If we go back, a different outcome might be possible. Isn’t it too regrettable to sit down without knowing anything, not even knowing the identity of the enemy? I can’t accept it. Even if there’s a very low chance, shouldn’t we try every possible method?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that true?”

 <p>
  The eyes of the Beast King narrowed towards the saintess.
 </p>
 <p>
  The saintess sighed deeply.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes… the goddess did give such an oracle.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why did you hide it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That is…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The saintess’s complexion turned pale.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as her lips were about to open again,
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackling.
 </p>
 <p>
  Noise blurred the vision, but it cleared within a few seconds, and the saintess spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even if we start over, will the outcome change?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Her voice was low.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wouldn’t it be better… to end it here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Her tone dropped even further.
 </p>
 <p>
  “All races of Townia united. Yet, we couldn’t win even once! And you suggest going back?”
 </p>
 <p>
  No one contradicted.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even the young man at the head of the table closed his eyes quietly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We are tired. I think it is better to end it here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”

 <p>
  A heavy atmosphere settled.
 </p>
 <p>
  I nodded and summarized the flow of the conversation.
 </p>
 <p>
  These were the guardians who tried to protect Townia.
 </p>
 <p>
  Humans, monsters. Regardless of race, they had gathered here. They had all joined forces to fight, but it seems they were utterly defeated. And now, facing annihilation, they gathered to await death.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It seems to make sense.’
 </p>
 <p>
  No major discrepancies.
 </p>
 <p>
  If a three-star hero were here to observe, anyone would nod in agreement.
 </p>
 <p>
  It had been said earlier.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was disgusting.
 </p>
 <p>
  I smirked.

 <p>
  It was true.
 </p>
 <p>
  Judging only by the current scene,
 </p>
 <p>
  They were scared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Cowards.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria muttered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flames sparked in her golden eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We can’t win? We end it like this? Don’t make me laugh. Are you kidding me! Your kin are watching! What kind of nonsense are you spouting!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria kicked her chair and stood up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her face flushed red as jade.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I once thought you were true heroes. It seems I was mistaken. You were cowards. There’s no greater cowardice! Aren’t you ashamed? You should be embarrassed!”

 <p>
  Shing!
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria drew her sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why is no one standing with me? Even if there’s a very low chance, even a slim possibility, if there’s a method, shouldn’t we try it? Why is no one speaking!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  No one opened their mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I will do it. I will do it. A hundred times, a thousand times! I’ll go back and change it. Even if my body breaks and tears, if it can save my people… I’ll do it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  A hero if ever there was one.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria’s eyes blazed as she stared at the goddess statue behind the throne.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her silver sword blade pointed at the goddess.

  “Goddess, if you are watching, respond! I, Priasis Al Ragnar, will accept the offer. If no one else will go, I will go back even if I’m alone!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Woosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  The twin goddess statue began to shake.
 </p>
 <p>
  Creak. The lips of the marble goddess parted, and a mystical voice flowed out.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Golden heir, Priasis.]
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t the grating voice from before.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was as clean as a breeze skimming through a forest.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your cry has been heard, and the contract has been established.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let them…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria looked around the table with a cold expression.

 <p>
  “Wait! Your Highness, what are you saying!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Creak.
 </p>
 <p>
  The twin goddess’s face turned towards the table.
 </p>
 <p>
  Both pairs of eyes flashed red.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Argh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A man clutched his chest and collapsed.
 </p>
 <p>
  He agonizingly groaned and then spat out dark red blood. Starting with that man, those who had not voiced any objection during Pria’s outcry began to collapse one by one, vomiting blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Golden heir, I will bestow the goddess’s blessing on you. Infinite opportunities will be granted, and true heroes will follow you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”

 <p>
  Pria closed her eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Below her, numerous humans and monsters lay scattered, vomiting blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  “P-Pria! Pria!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The blond young man cried out, but Pria did not open her eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rumble.
 </p>
 <p>
  The entire palace began to shake.
 </p>
 <p>
  One by one, the pillars fell and smashed, and parts of the ceiling fell down.
 </p>
 <p>
  The harbinger of collapse. The palace was about to fall.
 </p>
 <p>
  |Take the challenge. Rise. Conquer your destiny. The golden throne is yours.]

 <p>
  As the goddess sang, the palace crumbled.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm.’
 </p>
 <p>
  So it has come to this.
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They’re all cowards.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Cowards.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria’s words were fitting.
 </p>
 <p>
  They couldn’t be called heroes.
 </p>
 <p>
  A few questions were answered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Why Pria was appointed the main focus in most missions.
 </p>
 <p>
  To put it more bluntly, Townia revolves around this woman.
 </p>
 <p>
  The heroes who went through this promotion ceremony would understand the reason they were fighting and would be inspired to do the missions. A very exemplary way to boost morale.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Right.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If this is,
 </p>
 <p>
  the truth.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked up and laughed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bifrost was shaking wildly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stop the bullshit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Just before everything was buried, I drew my sword.
 </p>

 <p>
  Dark light flashed from the blade. Yurnet called this sword a manifestation of infinite possibilities, a crystal of interference. That seems about right.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Give it to me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Such a petty play is unnecessary.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bring it on.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The real thing.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Woosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  I gripped the blazing dark Bifrost tightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  I gripped the hilt firmly, took position, and slashed down.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang!
 </p>
 <p>
  The barrier in front of me shattered like glass, scattering around.

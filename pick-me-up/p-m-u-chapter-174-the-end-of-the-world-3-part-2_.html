  “Speak.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This isn’t the end, is it?”

 <p>
  The young man grinned.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course. We still have our pride. We must strike one last blow.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The young man stood up, his golden coat fluttering.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let it be known that we once existed here, that we lived each day fiercely, and that we did not lose our pride even in death.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right! I’ve been waiting, Your Royal Highness!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Beast King clenched his fist and stood up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Persephone! How are things below? Have all the women and children been safely evacuated?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, everyone has been evacuated.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Close the underground gates. We will resist to the very end.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The young man lifted his golden sheath.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We will not die easily! Our flesh will be torn, our bones will break, and our guts will stain the ground. But until the very last one of us, we will show them our will. Are you all with me? Are you ready to die with our beloved Townia?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “To the very end.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The three chieftains knelt together.
 </p>
 <p>
  The church’s Saintess and knights bowed deeply.
 </p>
 <p>
  The leaders of the various races laughed heartily.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What better death could there be? After all, we will all die someday. Would you rather die as a shriveled old man in a corner room or as a hero who will be remembered in history? Answer me, humans! You beings of other races! Will you die in fear, or will you die with pride?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The atmosphere shifted dramatically.
 </p>
 <p>
  The faces of the humans and monsters near the table, who had been trembling in fear, began to change.
 </p>

 <p>
  The goblins tremblingly drew their daggers, the ogres grasped their axes with both hands, the human knights unsheathed their spears, and the lizardmen waved their staffs.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do not fear. I will be the first to die. I will pave a glorious path to the afterlife for the heroes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thump!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the young man finished speaking, the entire palace shook violently.
 </p>
 <p>
  Persephone, the sorceress, bowed to the young man.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Assinis Knights have just been annihilated.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Our turn is next. Prepare.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The meeting ended.
 </p>
 <p>
  The previously quiet palace was now filled with various sounds.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soldiers and monsters checked their weapons and armor, knights soothed their horses and formed assault formations, mages refined their spells, and priests bestowed blessings on the warriors.

 <p>
  ‘So this is how it ends.’
 </p>
 <p>
  These people were not the cowards that the fake Pria had claimed them to be.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were no tremblers among them. Their eyes all sparkled with resolve.
 </p>
 <p>
  “My dear sister, Pria.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In the midst of the preparations for battle, the young man approached Pria, who was crouching in a corner by the table.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria sat there, trembling.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m sorry I couldn’t resolve your grievances.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…No, Your Highness.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ve come this far, and you still call me Your Highness? It’s too formal. Call me brother.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That… that is…”
 </p>

  “Even now, at the end, will you still call me Your Highness?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then brother…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Much better.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The young man grinned.
 </p>
 <p>
  He surveyed Pria’s face, which still bore tear stains, and then embraced her shoulders.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If I weren’t in this position, I’d feel the same as you. Honestly, I don’t care about pride. If it were possible to save everyone, to get a chance, I’d even sell my soul to a devil. But I can’t do that. You understand, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The young man playfully glanced around to make sure no one was watching, then whispered in Pria’s ear.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you can’t shake off your anger in the end… it’s okay to accept the proposal.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What?”
 </p>

  “I’ll always support you.”

 <p>
  “What are you saying…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your Highness, I have something to report.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll be right there.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The young man smiled at the puzzled Pria before following his aide.
 </p>
 <p>
  Left alone, Pria wore a dazed expression as she watched the young man’s retreating figure.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Not much time left.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The vibrations of the palace grew more intense.
 </p>
 <p>
  The grand doors leading outside also began to rattle ominously.
 </p>
 <p>
  A noble last stand followed by a glorious end. It was the sort of dramatic episode that would commonly feature in a movie.

 <p>
  I sat back in my chair, waiting for the end of the banquet to approach.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He would have been a better protagonist.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I mused that if this young man had been the main NPC in Townia, the story might have progressed more smoothly.
 </p>
 <p>
  I grumbled, not quite complaining, as I observed Pria. Tears still clung to her golden eyes as she sobbed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘She was sold out as a witch, a traitor.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I recalled the various accusations and curses that had been hurled at Pria.
 </p>
 <p>
  From what I could see, she hadn’t exactly betrayed anyone. The commanding aura she initially had was gone. Now, only the image of a vulnerable girl remained. She seemed to have given up.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If he was really the protagonist.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the young man.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had heard about him before. He was the second in line for the throne, the true heir apparent.

  “Your Highness.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stop. I won’t mention the goddess’s prophecy anymore.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Several people approached Pria, but she merely stared blankly in response before closing her mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Was Pria considering following the young man? She was also carrying a sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then the moment came.
 </p>
 <p>
  The young man, clad in armor, stood in the center of the red carpet.
 </p>
 <p>
  Around him, a motley crew of various races and genders stood, their eyes fiercely shining.
 </p>
 <p>
  The young man drew his sword with a cold gaze.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is our final battle. Let’s show a dignified end.”
 </p>
 <p>
  No one spoke.
 </p>

 <p>
  They simply raised their weapons.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria was also among them.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you for enduring.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The young man whispered as if to Pria.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria closed her eyes silently.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thump! Thump! Thump!
 </p>
 <p>
  The palace’s silver gates began to shake.
 </p>
 <p>
  Stones and wooden splinters flew as parts of the door buckled under force.
 </p>
 <p>
  The young man raised his sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is our final battle!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uooooh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Townia’s forces! Charge…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Before the young man could thrust his sword forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  The statue of the goddess behind the throne unexpectedly shattered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Amidst a cloud of dust, a shadow appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course.
 </p>
 <p>
  If this were truly the end.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it had ended here, the game wouldn’t have even started.

 <p>
  I wouldn’t be suffering in this world.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The last battle.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A chilling voice spread throughout the palace.
 </p>
 <p>
  A grating, spine-chilling tone.
 </p>
 <p>
  I recognized this voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  It still echoed deeply in my mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Who said so?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The figure laughed.

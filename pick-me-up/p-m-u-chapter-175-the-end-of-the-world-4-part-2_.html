 <p>
  Pria stumbled back.
 </p>
 <p>
  “D-Did something like this happen?”
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  [Yes, you’ve sold them out.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Tel chuckled and raised his left hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  From her left hand, a thick shadow began to unravel.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You who have forsaken the challenge have no right to be heroes. Become a sacrifice for the true heroes.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What… are you saying!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The game needs an enemy. Be the experience points.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Tel spread her hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  The shadow quickly expanded, engulfing person after person in the room.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no time to scream. The semi-transparent shadow swallowed everything, whether it was a human or a beast, and squirmed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Except for Pria.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have been chosen as the protagonist of Townia. You can be proud.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, I…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [There are hardly any viable hero candidates left. This world is screwed anyway. It’s so tiresome.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Cough! Choke! Gasp!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Those swallowed by the shadow vomited copious amounts of blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  Tar-like black blood. Dark red veins sprouted on their skin.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is this contamination?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Gurgling.
 </p>

 <p>
  The jelly-like shadow spread toward me.
 </p>
 <p>
  The shadow began climbing up from beneath my feet.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Danger!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han(★★★)’ is beginning to be contaminated!]
 </p>
 <p>
  I sneered and stomped the shadow with my sheath.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack. Black blood burst, and the shadow retreated on its own.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Contaminated state.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It seems the true heroes handle it this way.
 </p>
 <p>
  The cause of the enhancement failure. I felt disgusted. I grimaced and looked ahead. The two were still talking.
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you’re a hero, you should be able to throw everything aside for your goals, right, Priasis?]

 <p>
  “No… no! Don’t lie!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria cried out, shaking her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her neat and clean face was a mess with tear marks.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Admit it. You sold them out.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Lies! Lies!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s not a lie.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Tel grinned innocently and approached Pria, whispering in her ear.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You said so in your dreams.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait, that… that’s…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hehehehehe……..]

 <p>
  Pria sat down in despair.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You formed a contract based on words in a dream?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack!
 </p>
 <p>
  I stomped on the creeping shadow again.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seems this place is also falling apart. A portal shaped like an ellipse was flickering in the distance.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Let’s see.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Tel sat down next to the seated Pria and pulled out a ledger.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Townia. There is only one 5-star and three 4-star candidates for high-ranking heroes, pretty lame. Some hybrid bastard stirred up trouble. It’s doomed here too.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Tel flipped through the ledger expressionlessly, recording something while her gaze drifted somewhere.
 </p>
 <p>
  The young man being consumed by the shadow glared at Tel, half-kneeling.
 </p>

 <p>
  [You should have accepted it. If you had made a contract with me, the potential would have been much higher than with this moron.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Tel kicked the fallen Pria.
 </p>
 <p>
  The young man opened his mouth, but no sound came out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Tel smirked.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do you resent me?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Then become strong. Fight against the heroes. Become the greatest enemy and swallow the world. There might be a chance then.]
 </p>
 <p>
  It seems like the limit has been reached.
 </p>
 <p>
  The shadows were gathering in droves.
 </p>
 <p>
  I walked towards the direction of the portal.
 </p>

 <p>
  Crunch.
 </p>
 <p>
  The palace was collapsing.
 </p>
 <p>
  The debris of a broken pillar blocked the way.
 </p>
 <p>
  I lightly jumped over and walked towards the portal.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Well.’
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s still much that’s unknown.
 </p>
 <p>
  What I’ve seen here is just part of the truth.
 </p>
 <p>
  But…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There’s more than one or two filthy things.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Enough to make me feel nauseous.

 <p>
  I continued walking towards the portal.
 </p>
 <p>
  The surrounding scenery became blurry and started to twist. Tel and Pria, and those swallowed by the shadow, disappeared one by one. It was the end of this world.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoooosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  A blood-red sandstorm brushed against my cheeks.
 </p>
 <p>
  I narrowed my eyes. The surroundings had transformed into a desert.
 </p>
 <p>
  A dark desert. Red mist swirled around.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Floor 80.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Beyond the horizon of the desert.
 </p>
 <p>
  Someone was standing.
 </p>
 <p>
  The figure, clad in a pitch-black cape, glared at me.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-12" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  Hidden behind the mist, blood-red eyes sparkled.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Black Prince]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Praios Al Ragnar]
 </p>
 <p>
  The sparkling blond hair was now covered in a sticky black substance.
 </p>
 <p>
  A glimpse of skin under the cape was tightly wrapped in blood-red bandages, like a mummy.
 </p>
 <p>
  The golden irises had lost their radiance long ago. A sinister aura hovered in the dim gaze.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Are you the boss?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The 80th floor of Townia.
 </p>
 <p>
  We’ll meet soon.
 </p>
 <p>
  Slowly, a level appeared below the name tag.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Lv.354]
 </p>
 <p>
  A bitter smile slipped out.
 </p>
 <p>
  The estimated level range was in the mid-300s.
 </p>
 <p>
  Comparable to 7-star heroes.
 </p>
 <p>
  The 80th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Where real hell begins.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the difficulty is similar to Niflheimr, I had anticipated this much.
 </p>
 <p>
  I continued walking through the blood-red mist.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Sorry, but.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I won’t consider your circumstances.

  If anyone stands in my way, they’re just obstacles to be crushed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Waiting… waiting…]
 </p>
 <p>
  A ghost-like voice flowed from his bandage-wrapped mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked back at him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, wait. I’ll make it easy for you soon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In front of me, the portal swayed.
 </p>
 <p>
  I glanced back at him, then stepped through the portal.
 </p>
 <p>
  A chilly sensation ran through my body.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ba-dum!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Congratulations, Master!]

  [The forgotten memories of the hero awaken.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han(★★★★)’, promotion completed! You have become a 4-star.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Illustration is updated.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Level and skill limits have increased.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The hero’s first engraving is unlocked.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tips/What is an engraving?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s a special ability that heroes can acquire through the Descent Dungeon.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [A must for becoming a superior hero! A well-crafted engraving is nothing to scoff at compared to ten skills. Don’t forget to grant your hero an engraving!]
 </p>
 <p>
  When I opened my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  The red magic circle of the promotion place entered my view.
 </p>
 <p>
  A slight headache echoed in my head.
 </p>
 <p>
  I gripped my forehead and walked out to the square.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, Oppa. Congratulations!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna ran up to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed she had been waiting since I entered the promotion place.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now you’re a 4-star too. No one can look down on you. Anyway, anyone who messes with you is going down in one hit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oppa?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna blinked and looked at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s wrong? You look scary. Like you could kill someone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kill? What kind of thing is that to say?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I smirked and walked towards the stairs.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna followed me in a trot.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Next it’s your turn. Get ready.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “From an experienced person! Is there something to prepare for a 4-star promotion? I heard you could fail.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  I punched the wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna jumped back, startled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oppa?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There was a bug.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I continued up the stairs.
 </p>
 <p>
  From where I punched, a hologram window flickered.

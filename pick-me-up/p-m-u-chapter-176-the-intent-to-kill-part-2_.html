  “They did a good job of spinning a convincing tale.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle flinched.

 <p>
  [What do you mean, Loki?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes or no answers only.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I remained silent, and Iselle, though taken aback, nodded hesitantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The purpose of this game is to save a destroyed world. Is that correct?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Master and heroes, the waiting room exists for that purpose.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes. The missions too.]
 </p>
 <p>
  So far, this matched what I knew.
 </p>
 <p>
  The purpose of this world’s existence is to reverse the world’s destruction.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s the core meaning of the power of interference, and why the Master, heroes, and the waiting room exist.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Why are you asking all of a sudden?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The real question was now.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are the monsters in the missions related to the destruction?”
 </p>
 <p>
  […]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why are we fighting those creatures?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Wait… that’s to save Townia…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle hesitated.

 <p>
  I closed my eyes. I remembered the features of the destroyed worlds I had seen while riding the airship.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some worlds were engulfed in flames, others were covered by seas, and some were completely frozen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each had distinct characteristics, but they shared one commonality.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No one lives there.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Not a human, not a monster, not even a blade of grass could survive in those completely dead lands. They were truly destroyed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Iselle. I know more than you think. Don’t try to hide it from me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  […]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are any of the creatures that appeared in the missions caused the destruction?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I opened my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle, trembling, spoke.

 <p>
  [No.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then why did we go through all that trouble?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle looked at me with fearful eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a sign that she couldn’t speak. I grinned and drew my weapon, Bifrost.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Use this. It can block their eyes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle looked around cautiously before placing her hand on the blade.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dark energy flowed from the sword, enveloping both me and Iselle.
 </p>
 <p>
  [If they find out about this… it’s really the end for me.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry. I’ll protect you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’re not lying?]

 <p>
  Iselle looked up at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It won’t be long before I get that strong.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [O-okay.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle took a deep breath.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Loki, did you really visit the zero floor?]
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed that was what they called the place I had been.
 </p>
 <p>
  I nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. They sure spun a good lie.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [If they catch you, it’s really over. Sigh, haah.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle sighed deeply, her chest heaving, before speaking.

  [The monsters you’ve been fighting have nothing to do with the destruction of Townia.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Those creatures… were heroes from the past.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Whether human or from another race.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed.
 </p>
 <p>
  That meant the creatures we had been joyfully slaughtering were once guardians who had risked their lives to protect Townia.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The ones we will kill in the future will be the same.’
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why did it have to be this way?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [To create a game, such measures are necessary.]

 <p>
  Iselle continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  The two goddesses of Mobius created the game “Pick Me Up” to manipulate the destiny of worlds destined for destruction, specifically to harness the power of earthlings from a higher dimension of Mobius.
 </p>
 <p>
  [If there are heroes in the game, there must be enemies. That’s why…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “They turned perfectly fine people into enemies.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [If they had brought in real enemies…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “We wouldn’t stand a chance?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  I knew it.
 </p>
 <p>
  The real enemies that we will have to face.
 </p>
 <p>
  Will appear after the 80th floor.
 </p>

 <p>
  ‘I understand now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If those kinds of beings appeared right from the start, not even a deity of the game could defeat them.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, the existence of the monsters before that was…
 </p>
 <p>
  I grimly smiled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So they’re just for experience points?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The monsters are mostly sacrifices for the heroes’ progress. The process of turning them into monsters does cause some damage, so it interferes with restoration.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [When Mobius-affiliated worlds are destroyed, the director decides the monsters and heroes based on her criteria.]
 </p>
 <p>
  I think I get it now.
 </p>
 <p>
  I remembered the scenes from back then.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-12" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  If they had accepted the goddesses’ offer, they could have become ‘high-grade heroes.’ But since no one accepted, they became monsters.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It seems I understand the conditions for the inherent ranks.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The influence during their lifetimes likely determined their ranks.
 </p>
 <p>
  The key figures of those worlds became high-ranking. Those close to being extras became low-ranking.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether consciously or unconsciously, those who agreed with the goddesses remained as heroes, while those who opposed them became monsters.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They just do whatever they feel like.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I laughed in disbelief.
 </p>
 <p>
  One thing was clear, whether hero or monster, all were mere puppets.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just like the Master.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…’
 </p>
 <p>
  This much was trivial. The director was still hiding numerous secrets.
 </p>
 <p>
  Deliberately showing only the information that was beneficial to itself. It was disgusting. Even this promotion ceremony proved that.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Sigh.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, I thought of Pria.
 </p>
 <p>
  Was she just… disposable?
 </p>
 <p>
  Not just Pria.
 </p>
 <p>
  Including me, it applied to everyone.
 </p>
 <p>
  I got up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you. I have a better understanding of this world because of you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Uh, Um.]

  “Don’t worry. I’ll make sure no harm comes to you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  What I needed to do hadn’t changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Climb the tower, deal with the monsters, and keep getting stronger.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then, when the time comes, return to Earth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Only one more thing had been added to do in the meantime.
 </p>
 <p>
  I hadn’t cared about it before.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was already annoyed by the situation, but if I could just return, it didn’t really matter.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just leave as if I didn’t know anything. That’s what I had thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  But now, it was clear.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘You’re screwed.’

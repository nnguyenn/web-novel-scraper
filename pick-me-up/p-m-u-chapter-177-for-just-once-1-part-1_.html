  The Next Morning
 </p>
 <p>
  The results of the meeting had come out.

 <p>
  Of course, the conclusion was not unexpected. It was decided to thoroughly hide the truth from the lower-grade heroes while urging them to redouble their efforts in completing their missions. Edis and everyone else finally understood the reason for fighting and appeared a bit more relieved.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘……’
 </p>
 <p>
  Last night, Neryssa had come looking for me.
 </p>
 <p>
  She had subtly asked if I knew anything, but I had sent her away without a word. Neryssa might have explained to the other members the situation, but if her memory was complete, she should have realized something was amiss. Still, I couldn’t tell her.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sigh.
 </p>
 <p>
  A secret had formed that needed to be buried in my heart.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was bothersome, but unavoidable since I had already been hiding things.
 </p>
 <p>
  Regardless, the goal remained unchanged.
 </p>
 <p>
  We would rest and then climb the tower again.
 </p>
 <p>
  But before that.
 </p>
 <p>
  [“Do you wish to become stronger?”]
 </p>
 <p>
  On the right side of my field of vision.
 </p>
 <p>
  A video was playing on the screen of Anytng.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the video, a giant dragon was spewing fire.
 </p>
 <p>
  [“Do you wish to test your limits?”]
 </p>
 <p>
  Dozens of airships were hovering near the giant dragon.
 </p>
 <p>
  The shadows of numerous heroes were visible among the airships.
 </p>
 <p>
  [“Then challenge yourself! The lofty glory will be yours, Master!”]

  [“Coming Soon!”]
 </p>
 <p>
  The video ended with the giant dragon and the heroes colliding.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng, having paused operations for a while, pressed the triangle button to start playback again. Like flaunting the wealth of the Moebius Company, the PV was lavishly decorated with 3D and various CG effects.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A new season has began.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Periodically, once every certain period.
 </p>
 <p>
  A large event that encompasses the entire server is held.
 </p>
 <p>
  One of them was the seasonal World Raid Festa.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;World Raid Festa!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  [“Masters, the long-awaited Festa is back!”]
 </p>
 <p>
  [“An event for those who can’t control their power, the high rankers, and for the masters aiming for the top ranks! Here are the details.”]
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 </div>
 <p>
  I read through the announcement below.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was not much different from the previous ones.
 </p>
 <p>
  The condition to participate in the event was to join a ‘Dimensional City’ placed in certain sectors. Of course, since it involves outdoor activities, airships were necessary.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s tough without airships.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, some folks would somehow manage to rent airships and make it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The main event is the World Raid.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A large monster appears at a certain point.
 </p>
 <p>
  Masters form a joint front to collectively beat down the monster.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, the rewards are rare materials typically unobtainable by normal means. I had obtained the items used for the 5 Legendary Artifacts from this raid. Other rewards include top-grade soul stones, promotion stones, and special airship blueprints.
 </p>
 <p>

 <p>
  Anytng played the video once more.
 </p>
 <p>
  He seemed quite hooked on the event.
 </p>
 <p>
  However.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘You’re not up to snuff.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Would a low-level master butt in where ranks in the double digits swarm?
 </p>
 <p>
  No, even those around rank 100 can’t easily join the World Raid.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Those who carelessly scoop up spoons…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Get smashed by Niflheimr.
 </p>
 <p>
  From my perspective, it was natural. After all the hardship, when I’ve beaten everything down, they casually come and tap a few times to receive the rewards. While they were just watching from behind during the fierce battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Those bastards get crushed.’
 </p>

 <p>
  While other servers share rewards amidst laughter and joy, there’s no such thing in Server 2.
 </p>
 <p>
  If one does not do their minimal share, they will be torn apart under the barrage of the Niflheimr fleet. Of course, the ‘share’ is an absolute evaluation, and currently, Townia has no chance of doing its ‘share’.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Wake up.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if you participated, you’d turn to dust at the gesture of the raid monster.
 </p>
 <p>
  Townia’s forces are at best a medium-sized airship and a few 4-star heroes. It’s better to join the main event when you’ve grown a bit more. What I’m aiming for is something else.
 </p>
 <p>
  [During the Festa period, special events will be held in various places in the Dimensional City.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Excellent performances in these events will earn heroes points and prizes! Accumulate points and buy various materials and items from the ‘Event Shop’.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Below, the list of prizes was detailed.
 </p>
 <p>
  From high-grade potions and other consumables to top-tier promotion stones and blueprints for advanced facilities, along with various rare materials.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, at the very bottom, highlighted with flashy effects, were two items.

  [Rainbow Advent Stone]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hit the jackpot.’
 </p>
 <p>
  My hand involuntarily tensed.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had been promoted to 4-star, but my engraving slots were still empty.
 </p>
 <p>
  Typically, you’d have to grind exploration dungeons to gather Advent Stones. At best, you could get a B-rank Advent Stone given the low climbing floors. But the Rainbow Advent Stones available in this event…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Are up to S-rank.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Engravings could be obtained by clearing Advent Dungeons, but we have the chance to get our hands on something big.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Nice.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was an opportunity to dramatically speed up my sluggish growth.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was determined to participate in this event. After deciding, I scrolled down. The second highlighted item was shining.

  [5-star Summon Ticket]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Uh…?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The rainbow-colored ticket was sparkling.
 </p>
 <p>
  I rubbed my eyes and looked again. The holographic text hadn’t changed. The color of the ticket was the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Has the game company lost its mind?’
 </p>
 <p>
  They’re going to release a 5-star summon ticket.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng’s gaze had also turned this way.
 </p>
 <p>
  Are they sane? A 5-star guaranteed summon ticket. An item that had never been released during the seven previous Festa events. And it isn’t even a main event reward, but a sub-event one.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, it wouldn’t be released in large quantities, but having even one is different from having none at all. I sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng’s control window was locked onto the 5-star summon ticket.
 </p>

  I could tell how he felt just by looking at the screen. Anytng immediately clicked on the banner floating at the top of the screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  [“If you want something right now, pay immediately!”]
 </p>
 <p>
  [“Moebius supports the Master’s choice!”]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Festa Special Package (1)’ selected.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Package Contents – 2,000 gems, 100,000 gold, high-grade soul stone]
 </p>
 <p>
  [With great benefits!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [10% extra bonus points for Festa event prizes!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [All this for just 110,000 won!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The amount will be billed together with next month’s mobile phone bill. Would you really like to proceed?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes (selected) / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  A true game addict.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, if you’re aiming for high ranks, it’s not too bad.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Payment completed!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Products have been sent to your mail. Please check!]
 </p>
 <p>
  After receiving the items, Anytng immediately started purchasing other packages.
 </p>
 <p>
  Similar yet more expensive packages. With this, Anytng received a total 30% extra points buff for this event.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Gift Shop!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Buying ‘Warhorse Statue’ for 5,000 gold.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Giving ‘Warhorse Statue’ to Han(★★★★).]
 </p>
 <p>
  The warhorse statue thudded onto the desk beside me.
 </p>

 <p>
  I clicked my tongue. I could clearly understand Anytng’s intention.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘You want me to bring the 5-star summon ticket?’
 </p>
 <p>
  With just one warhorse statue?
 </p>
 <p>
  Make sense. There would be at least hundreds of masters participating in the event.
 </p>
 <p>
  Only one ticket might be released. To get the ticket, one must sweep through numerous competitive events.

 </p>
 <p>
  Warhorse statues were cascading into the corner.
 </p>
 <p>
  I lined up the statues spilling out in the display case.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before long, half of the display was filled with statues.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘……’
 </p>
 <p>
  Ultimately, my goal was the Rainbow Advent Stone.
 </p>
 <p>
  Getting the first engraving right was crucial as it would determine the course of my growth. The 5-star summon ticket… if there’s a chance, I’ll take it as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  I reviewed the event rules once more.
 </p>
 <p>
  Entry to the ‘Dimensional City,’ the venue for the event, was limited to one party per master.
 </p>
 <p>
  Additionally, there were entrance restrictions based on rating. For example, the Dimensional City closest to this waiting room was a ‘4-star exclusive area’.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They want us to compete at similar levels.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I like this.

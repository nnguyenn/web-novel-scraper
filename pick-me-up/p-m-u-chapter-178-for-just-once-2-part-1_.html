 <p>
  A cold breeze swept across my nape.
 </p>
 <p>
  I squinted my eyes open. Far away, a whirlwind of dimensions was raging. Beyond it, the landscape of a vast city was visible.

 <p>
  [Event Area!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dimensional City Helis]
 </p>
 <p>
  Days had passed since the event notification was posted.
 </p>
 <p>
  After establishing a basic strategy, we moved to participate in the event, soon approaching the event zone.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked around.
 </p>
 <p>
  Besides the Capitalism, on which we were aboard, numerous airships, large and small, were scattered everywhere. The fleet of airships stretched from right beside us to where the eye could see.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There are so many airships!” Jenna scratched her cheek.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We have to rank first among all these people. I wonder if it’s possible.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If it happens, good; if not, oh well. Don’t feel pressured.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If we return empty-handed, Master is going to scold us terribly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, what can we do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ll do my best, but there’s always a chance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since there’s no dying in such an event, I decided to enjoy it with a light heart. Jenna stretched out her legs and then headed inside the ship. She was going to join up with the other members at the airship’s training area.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Raid Festa’s special event consists of three parts.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Individual tournament.
 </p>
 <p>
  Team tournament.
 </p>
 <p>
  One is undisclosed.
 </p>

 <p>
  Anyway, to get the 5-star summon ticket Anytng wants and the high-grade ascension stone I need, we must place high in the special events.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘We have exactly five people, so the number is perfect.’
 </p>
 <p>
  One for the individual tournament.
 </p>
 <p>
  Three for the 3v3 team tournament.
 </p>
 <p>
  The last person for the secret event. Those who finish the event quickly will roam the city and challenge minor sub-events. Then we’ll aggregate the scores and claim the rewards. That’s the planned scenario, at least.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ooooong.
 </p>
 <p>
  The noise from numerous airships rang in my ears.
 </p>
 <p>
  With five people per airship, at least a thousand participants are in the event.
 </p>
 <p>
  More will keep arriving after us.
 </p>
 <p>
  Consider it a gathering of masters who can operate airships at the 40th level from the second server.

 <p>
  ‘It’s a relief that the high-levels aren’t here.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Masters with 5-star or higher grades have moved on to upper-tier dimensional cities.
 </p>
 <p>
  That was fortunate. If it’s a competition among similar levels, it’s definitely manageable. Although numerous, most are just dregs. I recalled various games from past Festas while waiting for our arrival.
 </p>
 <p>
  30 minutes later.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;We have arrived at our destination!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The broadcast from Townia’s mechanic, Radi, came through.
 </p>
 <p>
  I opened my eyes. Capitalism, having penetrated the dimensional whirlwind, was entering the docking station. The scale of the docking station was at least several kilometers. Hundreds of airships that had arrived earlier were positioned.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ooong.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Capitalism made a low-altitude flight and stopped in an empty parking area.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thunk. The airship came to a complete stop. The event participants walked out onto the deck.
 </p>

 <p>
  Jenna, Velkist, Kishasha, and lastly, Edis from the second party.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What should I do?” Radi, dressed in a mechanic’s outfit, pointed at herself.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just have fun and take good care of the airship.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sure. Good luck.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Click.
 </p>
 <p>
  Stairs descended from the airship’s railing.
 </p>
 <p>
  I stepped down the stairs and set foot on the land of the dimensional city.
 </p>
 <p>
  “These buildings look peculiar. It’s my first time seeing such structures.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis muttered.
 </p>
 <p>
  That would be expected. Except for me, none of the other members had seen such a scene anywhere.

 <p>
  ‘They’ve set up an interesting prank.’
 </p>
 <p>
  This time the setting was a modern city.
 </p>
 <p>
  Four-lane roads stretched out at right angles, and between them, high-rise commercial buildings and tall buildings soared like forests.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, ‘Bring the Ticket!’ party has arrived in the event area!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The event screen can be checked through the ‘Festa!’ icon in the main menu.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The event screen displays the points earned, the list of prizes, the status and morale of the heroes, and the list of events happening in the city. Some of these will require the master’s assistance. Check carefully each time to score high. We support you, Master!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Festa Package Buff (Bonus Points + 30%)’ is applied.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “There are so many people. It’s annoying.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist scowled.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was literal. The square outside the docking station was so crowded there was hardly room to stand. Dozens of buses parked on the road were busy transporting people, but there were even more heroes pouring in.

 <p>
  Buzzing.
 </p>
 <p>
  The noise from the countless crowd rang in my ears.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Line up, one by one! No cutting in line! If you fight arbitrarily, you’ll be kicked out right away!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Some personnel stood out.
 </p>
 <p>
  They moved among the heroes in well-tailored suits. A blue ID badge hung around their necks.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Moebius Corporation’s employees… perhaps?’
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed so.
 </p>
 <p>
  They soothed heroes who were dazed by the unfamiliar place and sometimes soothed them, loading them onto buses. They also mediated between quarreling heroes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There are… too many people. It smells…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha gagged.
 </p>

 <p>
  Edis glanced at me and then took the staggering Kishasha to a less crowded place. It seems our turn to board the bus will be quite late.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oppa, I’ve brought something helpful.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna handed me a long rectangular piece of paper.
 </p>
 <p>
  I scanned the topmost letters.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Dimensional City – Guide Pamphlet&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;This place is modeled after a city in a faraway dimension… boasting technology and convenience superior to Moebius…&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The pamphlet included a background of the city, usage of facilities, a simple explanation about vehicles, etc.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They call that a bus. It’s a horseless carriage. It moves on wheels and carries people.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I know that without explanation.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I nodded reluctantly.

  “Ah, it seems we will sleep at a place called a hotel. Meals are buffet style… hmm?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna’s eyes sparkled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We can take as much delicious food as we want! This is absolutely…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are all the people here 4 stars?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist interrupted Jenna’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna handed the pamphlet to Velkist. Velkist snatched the pamphlet and skimmed the guide.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems so.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why? What’s wrong?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They don’t seem very strong. Weren’t 4-stars supposed to handle at least a few minions?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist’s eyes moved.
 </p>
 <p>
  I knew where he was looking. The footsteps, posture, hands, and gazes of nearby heroes. Velkist, particularly sharp-eyed, could gauge the strength of a target just by observing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wake up from your dreams, strongest 4-star hero.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I patted Velkist’s head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Boring.”

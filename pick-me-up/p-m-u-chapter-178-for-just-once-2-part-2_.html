  Velkist’s eyes moved.
 </p>
 <p>
  I knew where he was looking. The footsteps, posture, hands, and gazes of nearby heroes. Velkist, particularly sharp-eyed, could gauge the strength of a target just by observing.

 <p>
  “Wake up from your dreams, strongest 4-star hero.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I patted Velkist’s head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Boring.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If there were 4-star parties raised by high-tier masters here, it would be different, but those users would mostly move on to upper-level dimensional cities. Most of the masters gathered here were stuck at level 40. Of course…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Not all, just most.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked back.
 </p>
 <p>
  A large-scale airship, at least three times larger than the Capitalism, was descending.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was covered in white steel, and a red emblem was stamped on its exterior.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are a few masters who choose the head of a snake over the tail of a dragon.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first of them had appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Judging by the size and facilities of the airship, its master was a user in the 60s.
 </p>
 <p>
  From an airship of a size visible even outside the docking station, 4-star heroes were descending.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Watch them closely. Those are the real competitors.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Indeed. Not entirely absent.”
 </p>
 <p>
  High-level masters began to appear one after another.
 </p>
 <p>
  The rewards of this city would mostly be swept by them. The rest of the ordinary users would scavenge whatever was left after the high-levels had their fill.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Five of them, huh.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Masters who had reached high levels and decided to join the 4-star event.
 </p>

 <p>
  Their heroes would surely be decked out with various high-end equipment and engravings.
 </p>
 <p>
  And it’s almost impossible for an ordinary user to gather even one innate 4-star hero, let alone a party composed entirely of them unless they’re a heavy spender.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anyway,
 </p>
 <p>
  It was through such events that I started to gain attention as a master.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The leader of the 4-star party snorted as she entered the square.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dressed in dazzling silver armor and a jewel-studded rapier at her waist, she confidently walked among the heroes, her tied-back blonde hair fluttering.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Riff-raffs.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The woman spoke without hiding her emotions.
 </p>
 <p>
  She wore the flashy silver armor stylishly. Her master was several levels above the users present here, and she enjoyed a status akin to a king in her own territory.

  “That lady seems strong, but…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Does it make you irritated?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna did not deny it.
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled and turned away. Watching the end of that person might not be a bad spectacle. A good show had emerged. When about half of the plaza had emptied.
 </p>
 <p>
  Vroom.
 </p>
 <p>
  A special vehicle appeared on the four-lane road where only buses had been passing.
 </p>
 <p>
  It slid in silently and stopped at the entrance of the docking station.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Why is that…?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I frowned.

 <p>
  At first glance, I recognized it, it was a luxurious black limousine. The side door opened, and an elderly man in a neatly dressed suit stepped out. The old man stood dignifiedly next to the door.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked to the side.
 </p>
 <p>
  The blonde woman, who had been watching the limousine with interest, approached the old man.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A carriage for a special guest.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s good. Our party will take it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m sorry, but you are not qualified.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The woman’s eyebrows twisted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s funny. My master has climbed up to the 64th floor. I’m the sub-master and the leader of the raiding party. I think that’s quite enough qualification compared to the trash gathered here. Isn’t that right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Miss, you’re going too far. trash, really. Aren’t we all 4-stars?”
 </p>

  “We’re innate 4-stars, and you all are clearly innate 1-star or 2-star. Yes, that’s right. trash. Don’t talk to me. It’s upsetting.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What, what…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The woman who had scoffed turned back to the old man.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Our party has come here to be number one in this event. Naturally, that will happen. I think that should be enough explanation. So…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Again, I must inform you, that you are not qualified.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s ridiculous. Then who does?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The old man pointed at the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  Everyone’s gaze followed his finger.
 </p>
 <p>
  An airship was entering.
 </p>
 <p>
  The woman’s expression soured.
 </p>

 <p>
  The airship was not large. At best, it was about the size of Capitalism. However, it had a completely different design. A sleek black gloss and streamlined body. The master’s emblem was embedded on the side.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you saying that our Arias is pathetic compared to that minnow-like airship? Seriously, words fail me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Oooong.
 </p>
 <p>
  The propellers on both wings folded as the airship landed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Holy crap.’
 </p>
 <p>
  “It looks to be about level 50. Let’s see. What kind of distinguished person would be qualified, I wonder. The emblem is a black goat… Hmm? A black goat?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The woman tilted her head, then her eyes widened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “God, a black goat!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The woman gasped.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s a black goat?”
 </p>

 <p>
  Velkist whispered to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sighed. The side of the airship opened, and stairs descended.
 </p>
 <p>
  From those stairs, heroes in black uniforms walked down one by one.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bwooow.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sound of a horn echoed.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had heard this sound before.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a signal for the entry of a ranker.
 </p>
 <p>
  No, not just heard of it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Yurnet.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I recalled her smiling face.

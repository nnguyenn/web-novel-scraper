 <p>
  The next morning.
 </p>
 <p>
  The opening ceremony of the event began.
 </p>

 <p>
  A representative from Mobius gave a purpose speech and briefly explained the rules.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here, I was able to get a clear schedule of the event.
 </p>
 <p>
  The event will last for three days.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first day includes the opening ceremony and the preliminaries of the three major events, the second day features the main rounds, and the final rounds and the championship take place on the third day.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were also minor events scattered throughout the schedule.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Mobius and Earth have different time flows, the company adjusted the time axis specifically for this festival.
 </p>
 <p>
  The special event venues varied, so we had to scatter immediately after the opening ceremony.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, having boiled Katiio alive to equip portable communication devices allowed us to prepare for any unforeseen circumstances. I immediately boarded a transport bus to move to the event venue.
 </p>
 <p>
  While moving, I reviewed the details I heard at the opening ceremony.
 </p>
 <p>
  One important detail was that even if one dies in the dimensional city, they can be resurrected without any degradation in abilities. However, a resurrected hero loses the right to participate in the event. Another point was that the recovery abilities of the waiting room do not apply here.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Did Aaron say he would return if he won the one-on-one tournament?
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron’s voice lingered in my ears. It didn’t seem like a joke. After a brief conversation with me, Aaron left to prepare for the competition.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’m curious.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist was participating in the one-on-one competition.
 </p>
 <p>
  I wanted to see the battle up close if possible. To do that…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I have no choice but to finish as quickly as possible.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking at the schedule, the singles event is held last.
 </p>

 <p>
  If I finish the preliminary round quickly, I might be able to go watch the singles event.
 </p>
 <p>
  I should start with my part first.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked out the window. The four-lane road was filled with transport buses. All were heroes participating in the random events. This category had an unusually high number of participants.
 </p>
 <p>
  It couldn’t be helped.
 </p>
 <p>
  With rumors spreading that Niflheimr would participate in the individual and team events, many decided to withdraw from the events. Conversely, there was a rush of applicants for the random event, in which Niflheimr was not participating.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It seems total victory isn’t their goal.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Judging by their withdrawal from one category, it seemed like they wanted to give the superior trainees some practical experience.
 </p>
 <p>
  They didn’t seem particularly greedy for the five-star summon ticket.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, what can I say?’
 </p>
 <p>
  This Festa was an event for non-rankers.
 </p>

 <p>
  The current rankers didn’t have the luxury of time for such petty tricks, being busy with the groundwork for the World Raid. Essentially, Niflheimr was giving up on this raid.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rare materials were so abundant for them that skipping once didn’t really matter.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon, the bus stopped.
 </p>
 <p>
  Along with the other participants, I followed the guidance of a staff member waiting in the parking lot and entered a huge domed stadium.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You can wait here. The person in charge will come soon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A female staff member quickly walked us into a spacious auditorium and then exited hurriedly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are we supposed to do here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s what I’m wondering. It’s a strangely designed facility, but it doesn’t seem special.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why is it taking so long? Call the manager quickly!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Murmurs filled the dome.

 <p>
  I leaned against the wall at the corner of the indoor stadium.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s a damn lot.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Only one person among these can win the prize along with the championship.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was an exceedingly stingy event.
 </p>
 <p>
  After a few minutes, a tiny dot appeared at the distant lectern.
 </p>
 <p>
  The creature flapped its pair of wings before folding them and sitting on the lectern.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Heroes participating in this event!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The fairy spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her black hair was long and braided, and she wore a form-fitting women’s suit.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her cheeks puffed up like steamed buns, tinged with a hint of red.

 <p>
  [Hello everyone! You all exude the dignity of heroes. Thank you for participating in this battle royale I’m hosting. You truly have discernment. I’m moved by your enthusiastic participation.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The fairy giggled, covering her mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, a line of Mobius’s temple staff stood at ease behind her.
 </p>
 <p>
  [As for me…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Iselle?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Someone at the front spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  The fairy with a gentle smile on her face suddenly stiffened.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  As if triggered by the comment, the fairy flapped her wings with a tremendous boom and moved in front of the man at high speed, a sonic boom evidence of her speed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [What did you just say?]
 </p>

 <p>
  “Ah, no…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [You’re comparing me to some house fairy?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The fairy aggressively thrust her temple ID in the man’s face.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Can’t you see this? It’s a golden temple ID gifted to me personally by the CEO! Don’t even compare me to the irregular slaves clinging to your homes! That if you don’t want your head smashed, understand? Huh? Do you get it!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The man dumbly nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  The fairy snorted and stepped back onto the platform.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ohoho! Heroes, this event is a collaboration with a famous company~ Collaboration~ It’s a great honor. I hope you all enjoy it. The masters are also watching. This is your chance to prove your courage and ability. Fight on!]
 </p>
 <p>
  With a charming voice, the fairy shouted and began to spin in the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Twinkle! Fairy power!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash!

  A blue flash lit up the entire stadium, and a holographic message appeared in front of everyone.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Raid Festa!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘PlayerKnown’s BattleRoyale’]
 </p>
 <p>
  [※Note!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [This is not a knockoff.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s a collaboration~.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Let me explain the rules of the competition.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [A special super-dimensional field is prepared for the event.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [1. Participants start barehanded, returning all equipment, and must fight until only one remains by acquiring hidden items and equipment throughout the field.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [2. The field shrinks at regular intervals, and magical items, including supplies, are dropped.]
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  [3. Participants can form temporary parties for a common goal.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [※Attention!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [This is not a knockoff.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Please believe us.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Below the message, a simple map of the field used for this competition was displayed.
 </p>
 <p>
  I quickly scanned the rules and map.
 </p>
 <p>
  [What you see before you are the result of our excellent capabilities! PlayerKnown’s Battle Royale!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Oh! If anyone speaks strangely, it’s an officially permitted collaboration~ with another gaming company. Ohohoho!]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Doesn’t this violate copyright rules?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, it doesn’t matter.
 </p>
 <p>
  They say it’s okay.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s not my business if they get sued.
 </p>
 <p>
  After a hearty laugh, the fairy clapped her hands as if remembering something and pulled out a jewel box from her robe.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Pay attention! This is a special prize for the winner of this event.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The fairy opened the box.
 </p>
 <p>
  A rainbow-colored stone sparkled on a soft cushion.
 </p>
 <p>
  [A top-grade advent stone! Such an item that even idiots like you… no, heroes, would struggle to obtain.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Click.
 </p>
 <p>
  The box closed.

  I looked outside through the shattered shop window.
 </p>
 <p>
  Near the dark, unlit intersection, shadows were squirming about.

  They were one of the groups of survivors from this preliminary round. The party, consisting of two men and a woman, was crossing the crosswalk, each armed with a bow, a spear, and a shield.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Survivor Count – 6]
 </p>
 <p>
  White letters flashed in the upper right corner of my view.
 </p>
 <p>
  The number of survivors left on the field. 14 out of 20 had died.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the result of one hour since the start.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s been dragging on for quite a while.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The map was larger than I thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  It had taken me more time than expected to find them.
 </p>
 <p>
  If only the field had been half as small, I would have already gone to watch the individual preliminaries.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were passing right beneath me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had a spiked metal pipe slung on my belt.
 </p>
 <p>
  Following that, I slid down the building’s drainpipe.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wha!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I locked eyes with one of the men.
 </p>
 <p>
  I immediately drew my hand crossbow and pulled the trigger. Ping! With a crisp sound, the bolt lodged itself in the man’s nape.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Gurk!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [11Kill!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Enem, enemy attack…!”
 </p>

 <p>
  Ping! Ping! Ping!
 </p>
 <p>
  The two managed to dodge the three consecutive shots by leaping.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even the least skilled were 4-stars. Physically they were superhumans. I then landed in the alley and stomped the ground, wielding my metal pipe.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait! There’s no need for this…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  The man attempted to block with his crude wooden shield.
 </p>
 <p>
  The metal pipe smashed halfway through the wooden shield. I then kicked the staggering man and slammed his head onto the asphalt.
 </p>
 <p>
  [12Kill!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Augh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The woman, perhaps a thief class, sprang onto the roof of a two-story building like a squirrel and began to flee.

 <p>
  I climbed the wall and pursued her. As she fired several arrows while running, I dodged them all and continued the chase.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why wouldn’t they hit!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stop following me! Mon, monster!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon, the woman caught by the nape died instantly with a dagger lodged in the back of her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  [13Kill!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Why wouldn’t they hit?
 </p>
 <p>
  Such arrows are child’s play compared to Jenna.
 </p>
 <p>
  I kicked the sprawled woman. Her body turned into light and slowly disappeared.

 <p>
  ‘That leaves two.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I spent almost 30 minutes searching the entire field, dealing with the survivors.
 </p>
 <p>
  I formed no alliances. The power of the 18th group in the preliminaries, which included me, had already been fully assessed from outside the dimensional gate.
 </p>
 <p>
  After using my Insight skill to check the power of the heroes in my group, I decided that there was no one worth guarding against.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meaning, there was no need to waste time. Although I would need to be somewhat cautious in the finals where the last 100 gathered, I can be a bit reckless here.
 </p>
 <p>
  I casually picked up items left by the fallen heroes and moved toward the center of the field.
 </p>
 <p>
  The last survivors of this preliminary round were gathered in a half-constructed abandoned building in the middle of a junction.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They’ve made quite the nuisance.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Barricades were set up at the entrance of the building.
 </p>
 <p>
  Through a gap, the aim of a crossbow was fixed on me.
 </p>

  “Hey, hey you. Who are you? You’ve been wiping out the participants all by yourself. Are you really the same 4-star as us?”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘You’re weak. How did you manage to become 4-stars without polishing any skills properly.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Most of these heroes were the product of incompetent masters. Of course, even if their abilities were higher, the outcome would have been the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No matter who you are, you can’t break through this barrier!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The building entrance was blocked with a solid steel plate.
 </p>
 <p>
  Through a small gap, numerous spearheads gleamed. They seemed to have put quite an effort into it.
 </p>
 <p>
  And on the second-floor window of the building, a familiar object was installed.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a ballista.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So they’ve got their hands on one of those.’
 </p>
 <p>
  All I had were a metal pipe, a hand crossbow, and a few daggers.

 <p>
  “Just die quietly!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thwack!
 </p>
 <p>
  The ballista ejected a large arrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  Where I had been standing was deeply gouged out, and asphalt debris flew everywhere. In that moment, I dodged a crossbow bolt aimed at exploiting my motion.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Annoying.
 </p>
 <p>
  I strode straight towards the barricade.
 </p>
 <p>
  The reloading of the ballista had started.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hmm.
 </p>
 <p>
  It indeed seemed a bit difficult to break through the sturdy barricade with just a metal pipe.

  I grabbed a streetlamp lying beside the road. The smashed middle of the streetlamp seemed like it could serve as a handle.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Hup!’
 </p>
 <p>
  With all my strength drawn up, I lifted the streetlamp.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kwoong. Hundreds of kilograms of streetlamp were lifted into the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That crazy bastard…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Quick, shoot him dead!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thwack!
 </p>
 <p>
  The second ballista shot.
 </p>
 <p>
  I lowered my stance and swung the streetlamp.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ballista arrow that hit the side of the streetlamp shattered into pieces.

 <p>
  ‘As expected.’
 </p>
 <p>
  This streetlamp was considered a ‘great sword’ and received skill adjustments.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, it was easy.
 </p>
 <p>
  I immediately hurled my body towards the barricade.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  With one strike, I smashed through the barricade.
 </p>
 <p>
  After tossing the streetlamp aside, I entered with the metal pipe in hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  What followed was a rapid series of actions.
 </p>
 <p>
  [14Kill!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [15Kill!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [#1/20]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You won! Tonight’s dinner is chicken!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have won the preliminary round!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Look forward to the first main round tomorrow!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Flash.
 </p>
 <p>
  Light enveloped me, and before I knew it, I was back at the stadium.
 </p>
 <p>
  From entry to clear, it took exactly 90 minutes. A female staff member approached me dazedly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uh… Congratulations on passing the preliminaries.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can I go now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, yes yes. Please come by 8 a.m. tomorrow.”

  “You’re really amazing! The fastest to pass!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I received my equipment from the showcase and walked out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the indoor stadium, heroes who had been eliminated from the event were gathered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among them were those I had personally hunted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “He’s the mad dog of the battle royale!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A mad dog?
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked toward the source of the sound.
 </p>
 <p>
  The heroes were murmuring and glancing at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They say he nailed a hero’s forehead and killed him…”

 </p>
 <p>
  “The moment someone requested to party, he smashed their head.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He’s truly a blood-crazed beast!”
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed I had gotten a strange nickname.
 </p>
 <p>
  It didn’t matter. I decided to ignore the losers’ barking.
 </p>
 <p>
  It would quiet down by tomorrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  I unfolded the information flyer.
 </p>
 <p>
  The flyer listed the routes and schedules of shuttle buses traveling throughout the city. The bus to the individual tournament preliminaries was arriving in 5 minutes. Fortunately, I wasn’t late.
 </p>
 <p>
  In less than 10 minutes, I arrived at the venue for the individual preliminaries.

 <p>
  In less than 10 minutes, I arrived at the venue for the individual preliminaries.
 </p>
 <p>
  The place for the individual matches was also a dome-shaped giant stadium. After having my identity checked at the entrance, I entered. Inside, eight square arenas were set up, and the preliminaries were in full swing.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  I spotted Velkist sitting in a corner of the stadium.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wha! Who”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist turned to look at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Senior? How did you get here? Weren’t you busy with the preliminaries?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s already over, man. How’s it going?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “My turn’s all done. Just watching now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The results?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is there a need to say it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist grinned.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, that’s expected. I plopped down next to Velkist on a steel chair.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Any decent ones?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Somewhat.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist’s gaze swept over the arenas where battles were happening.
 </p>
 <p>
  Most were too poor for me to bother watching, but a few caught my eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That senior, he’s grown quite a bit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist crossed his arms.
 </p>
 <p>
  His gaze was directed towards the left corner of the arena.
 </p>

 <p>
  There…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Aaron.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron, dressed in Niflheimr’s uniform, was pressing his opponent.
 </p>
 <p>
  With each clean thrust of his spear, his opponent staggered back.
 </p>
 <p>
  “His growth exceeds his talent. It’s surprising.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He wouldn’t have gone to Niflheimr for nothing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He must have worked himself to the bone, maybe even more than me. But that’s all.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist dismissed his once fiercely fought opponent as ‘that’s all’ and moved his gaze to the next arena.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…’
 </p>
 <p>
  This guy’s standards had risen too.
 </p>

 <p>
  Day in and day out, he fought me, and after Kishasha joined, he had one more opponent. His skills were incomparable to those times.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist, like me who had obtained Ascend, and Jenna who obtained Sidewinder, had awakened his own unique combat style using his wildness.
 </p>
 <p>
  His talent was outstanding, and apart from missions, he spent almost all his 24 hours training, so the results were somewhat expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Aaron.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron helped his fallen opponent up, bowed, and then descended from the arena. As Velkist had said, what was once low-level spear skills at levels 3-4 seemed to have advanced to intermediate.
 </p>
 <p>
  But that was it for now.
 </p>
 <p>
  Maybe more could be seen in the finals.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was possible that he would face Velkist in the main matches.
 </p>
 <p>
  I shifted my gaze to where Velkist was looking.
 </p>
 <p>
  The central arena. Another participant from Niflheimr was standing there.

 <p>
  “Yaaaah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A female bandit’s twin swords swirled fiercely.
 </p>
 <p>
  He smoothly deflected every sword strike with a single dagger he held.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you making fun of me?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The bandit shouted as if possessed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, I’m just matching you with a suitable weapon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The young man spun his dagger as he spoke indifferently.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no look of underestimating the opponent in his eyes. He truly believed what he said. Realizing this, the bandit’s expression turned pale.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That guy…’
 </p>
 <p>
  A bright white cross symbol was drawn on the chest of his uniform.
 </p>

 <p>
  It was the mark of the top trainee from the academy.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Heh… interesting, very interesting.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist’s lips curled up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you know? That guy used different weapons in each of the four preliminaries. The first was a spear, the second an axe, the third a bow, and the last a dagger.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Fire lit in Velkist’s eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  The kind of look he only showed when he was about to fight me.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed something had truly sparked his competitive spirit.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Certainly, a face I didn’t recognize.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed he was summoned while I was away.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  ‘Using different weapons.’
 </p>
 <p>
  From Velkist’s expression, it seemed like the proficiency in each was top-notch.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So there was such a monster… As expected of Niflheimr?”
 </p>
 <p>
  People nearby were murmuring about that guy.
 </p>
 <p>
  “From what I hear, he’s the top trainee of Niflheimr.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you know what his nickname is? The Second Coming of the Sword Demon!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sword Demon? If it’s the Sword Demon…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right. Loki’s left arm. The strongest swordsman of Mobius.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sword Demon was the nickname of Ridigion.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sort of understood. That guy’s ability and why Velkist’s fighting spirit was ignited.
 </p>

 <p>
  ‘A talent freak greater than Jenna.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He could use most weapons at an expert level.
 </p>
 <p>
  His main weapon, the sword, was naturally beyond that.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is it already advanced?’
 </p>
 <p>
  If that guy had learned it…
 </p>
 <p>
  Including me, no one here could match him with pure technique. Advanced weapon skills were typically mastered at the very end of 5-stars.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the rumors were true, it was quite the catch.
 </p>
 <p>
  I wanted to ask Yurnet, but I suppressed my urge and waited. It would reveal itself eventually.
 </p>
 <p>
  The match was decided.
 </p>
 <p>
  The guy passed by the bewildered bandit and descended from the arena. Aaron was waiting.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Amazing skills. I learned a lot by watching…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The guy ignored Aaron’s friendly words and left the stadium.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Stunned, Aaron shrugged and followed him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist laughed coldly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They seem to get along worse than expected.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Indeed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron had called himself a parachute.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed quite a complicated situation that was intertwined.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Second Coming of the Sword Demon.’
 </p>
 <p>
  My hands itched.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it weren’t for the Advent Stone and the ticket, I would have thrown everything and participated in this individual competition.
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t understand why Myudun had sent Aaron here.
 </p>
 <p>
  I believe it wasn’t the right time to send him out.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘We’ll see.’
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter who it was, it didn’t matter.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because Townia would take the win.

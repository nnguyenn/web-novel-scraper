  When we exited the hotel entrance, Capitalism was parked in the lot.
 </p>
 <p>
  The airship approached us and lowered its steps. As we boarded the deck, the airship slowly began to lift off.

 <p>
  ‘Anytng…’
 </p>
 <p>
  He was still connected.
 </p>
 <p>
  For nearly three days, he had kept the game running:
 </p>
 <p>
  A remarkable game addict.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;WORLD RAID FESTA!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  [Sub Event Ends and Rewards Distribution Notice]
 </p>
 <p>
  [All sub-events of the World Raid Festa have ended! We thank all Masters for their participation, and here’s an announcement regarding event rewards and rankings…]
 </p>
 <p>
  The whole city was cast in shadow.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked up. An innumerable number of airships filled the sky. From mid-sized airships like ours to colossal ones the size of large buildings.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hundreds at a glance, but this fleet was only a part of the whole.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The main event begins now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With the end of the sub-events, the main menu of this event, the World Raid, was about to start.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were heading to the location where the raid monster would appear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Uuuuung. The collective noise of hundreds of airships made my ears ring.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can we join them?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not yet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled in response to Kishasha’s question.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘For now.’

 <p>
  Anytng and I were still low-level.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the next season would be different.
 </p>
 <p>
  What we did this time didn’t even scratch the surface of the season event.
 </p>
 <p>
  The World Raid, where hundreds of top-ranked players from Server 2 gather to compete and cooperate against high-level monsters, is one of the highlights of Pick Me Up’s many contents.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So, hurry up and grow stronger.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at Anytng’s game screen.

 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng was sweeping the shop for Warhorse Statues.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s the least you could do. Who do you think gave you your five-star ticket? I almost broke my back trying to make a master who sucks in mini-games win the championship.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Here are the ranking details of the 4-star Dimensional City.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [1st: Anytng (Taonir) – 132,221 Points]
 </p>
 <p>
  [2nd: Loki (Niflheim) – 85,234 Points]
 </p>
 <p>
  [3rd: Kkudok…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Niflheimr got second place.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the 4-star Dimensional City.
 </p>
 <p>
  Their reputation will take a hit, but that’s fine.

 <p>
  I plopped down on a steel chair on the deck.
 </p>
 <p>
  Capitalism was leaving the event city, heading for the dimensional jump point. The fleet heading to the raid was disappearing in the distance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Let’s see what we got.
 </p>
 <p>
  I checked the list of items Anytng had acquired.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first thing that caught my eye was a shimmering rainbow-colored ticket.
 </p>
 <p>
  The 5-star guaranteed summon ticket earned as the overall first-place reward.
 </p>

 <p>
  Since a natural 5-star would be at least above average, it would greatly help in forming the party.
 </p>
 <p>
  Next was an airship blueprint.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a necessary item for building a high-level airship.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition, there were high-grade promotion stones and various rare materials. A good foundation for further expansion.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The most important is the Advent Stone.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I took out a jewel box from my pocket.
 </p>
 <p>
  The highest-grade Advent Stone, a prize for winning the Battle Royale.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was more crucial to me than a 5-star summon ticket and something I desperately needed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The problem is that this is just the beginning.’
 </p>
 <p>
  To use this Advent Stone, I need to unlock a special dungeon and clear its mission to obtain an engraving.

 <p>
  There’s also a chance of failure, and the price is corruption or death.
 </p>
 <p>
  Failing means it’s over.
 </p>
 <p>
  I decided to plan the details once I returned.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was something that would shape my future.
 </p>
 <p>
  I don’t want to show a weak side when that guy returns.
 </p>
 <p>
  It would be embarrassing to fall behind.
 </p>
 <p>
  Buuuuung.
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally, the dimensional city vanished from view.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the deck of Capitalism, Edis and Kishasha went inside, and Velkist, who had been standing still, followed them saying he was going to train.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh.”

  In front of me, Jenna was struggling to untie a knotted plastic bag.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, this. It won’t open. How did they tie this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let me see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a black plastic bag like the ones you see at convenience stores.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took the bag from Jenna and started untying the tightly knotted part.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was quite heavy.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The food there was delicious. They said I could take it, so I brought some. I thought we could eat together. You didn’t have breakfast.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I untied the bag and handed it back to Jenna.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nice catch!”
 </p>

 <p>
  Jenna whistled and laid out the contents of the bag.
 </p>
 <p>
  “First, my recommendation! I was really surprised by this one. Who knew such a flavor existed? Have you heard of it? A perfect blend of refreshing and sweet!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna placed a milk carton on the deck.
 </p>
 <p>
  The color was a bright turquoise.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mint choc…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You have it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What? No, it’s really delicious…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I said you have it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You eat that. What’s next?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, this will surprise you. Ta-da!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna took out a food item wrapped in plastic on a disposable plate.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s called tangsuyuk. Funny name, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna quickly unwrapped it and placed a fork in front of me.
 </p>
 <p>
  This one was edible. I was quite hungry anyway.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sauce?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna grinned and took out a container of tangsuyuk sauce.
 </p>
 <p>
  And began pouring it over the tangsuyuk.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Damn…’
 </p>
 <p>

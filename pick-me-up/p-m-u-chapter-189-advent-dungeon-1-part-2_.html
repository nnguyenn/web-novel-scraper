 <p>
  Finally, as the blood mist scattered, his form was revealed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Danger!]

 <p>
  [Black Dragon Halgiraf Lv.64]
 </p>
 <p>
  Steel-like claws and massive wings. His body was densely covered with shiny scales.
 </p>
 <p>
  His slitted pupils were directed at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  The creature’s jaws opened wide.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Graaaaaaah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A roar that shook the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  In an instant, the Black Dragon’s body disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  I instinctively drew my sword and swung.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang!
 </p>
 <p>
  [This monster is immune to physical attacks!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The sword slid helplessly off the scales.
 </p>
 <p>
  As expected, its characteristics hadn’t changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  I jumped back and swung my sword wide.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang! The black scales the creature threw sparked against my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Corrupted Shadow Lv. 31] X 15
 </p>
 <p>
  Shadows sprouted from the scales buried in the sand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Physical and magical immunity, scale throwing, and minion summoning.
 </p>
 <p>
  These were the three patterns I had become accustomed to.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  “Graaaaah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the creature’s claws struck the ground, a wall of sand rose.
 </p>
 <p>
  I deflected the claws and retreated to the edge of the field.
 </p>
 <p>
  Much faster and stronger than before.
 </p>
 <p>
  I discarded my sword. It was useless against its physical immunity.
 </p>
 <p>
  I extended my hand into the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Send it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Deploying.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  As I raised my hand, a translucent sword appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Varisada. One of the Niflheimr Collection, a weapon with physical penetration attributes.

 <p>
  As the floor level increased, weapon summoning efficiency gradually decreased.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although I didn’t have Bifrost, it wasn’t impossible to summon a weapon.
 </p>
 <p>
  So I should use it. I saved it for this moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Graaaaaah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Black Dragon roared and leaped several meters into the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the ground, its shadow lunged toward me. I loosely gripped Varisada and swung it in a half-circle.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Physical Penetration!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Slice.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kyahaaaaak!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Talking nonsense.”

 </div>
 <p>
  Crunch.
 </p>
 <p>
  I stomped on the dragon’s front paw, spraying black blood everywhere.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had already analyzed its pattern long ago, did you think I couldn’t catch it alone?
 </p>
 <p>
  Physical immunity was the only problem. With that resolved, it was nothing.
 </p>
 <p>
  I grinned and lunged into its body.
 </p>
 <p>
  Slash.
 </p>
 <p>
  About 15 minutes later.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Black Dragon lay collapsed on the sand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Its viscous blood pooled on the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  I shook the blood from my sword onto the sand.

 <p>
  It wasn’t particularly difficult.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had fought this thing before, and I had become immeasurably stronger since then.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no need to use Ascend.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stage Clear!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have cleared the Intermediate Advent Dungeon.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have obtained the special engraving ‘Black Dragon Blood (C+)’ which can be given to the hero who challenged the dungeon.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Eligible hero – ‘Han (★★★★)’]
 </p>
 <p>
  Wooong.
 </p>
 <p>
  A black light floated above the Black Dragon’s corpse.
 </p>
 <p>
  I moved the control panel to check the engraving.

  [Black Dragon Blood (C+, Lv.1)]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Pure blood proving the lineage of the dragon that has been passed down since the beginning of time. It has been greatly diluted over many generations.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Effect: Physical Defense +10%, Magical Defense +10%]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Unique Skill: Dragon Scale (Duration 1 second)]
 </p>
 <p>
  The additional effects weren’t particularly special.
 </p>
 <p>
  The noteworthy point was the unique skill, Dragon Scale. There was no description, but it wasn’t hard to guess its effect.
 </p>
 <p>
  Immunity to all physical and magical damage for 1 second. The performance and duration of the skill would increase as the engraving skill level rises.
 </p>
 <p>
  On its own, it’s a common skill, but thinking of its synergy with other skills changes the story.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because I have special skills that return damage when used.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I use Soulblade Fusion during Dragon Scale…….’

 <p>
  I could use that skill one time without any burden.
 </p>
 <p>
  I could finally escape being a suicide bomber.
 </p>
 <p>
  The black orb circled around me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Reaching out my hand would start the engraving ceremony.
 </p>
 <p>
  My first engraving would be determined as Black Dragon Blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘……Of course.’
 </p>
 <p>
  That wouldn’t do.
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled and walked past the Black Dragon’s corpse.
 </p>
 <p>
  Do you think I would be satisfied with a mere C-grade engraving?
 </p>
 <p>
  Then all the trouble in the dimensional city would have been meaningless.

  While engravings could evolve through growth, this level wasn’t enough.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Master.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Doing more than this is reckless.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet seemed to have realized what I was about to do.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had told her I was challenging the Advent Dungeon, but not this.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Prepare the last weapon summon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Master! A second advent is still too early…….&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I closed my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  35th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  The scene vividly came to mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  I would never go through that again.
 </p>
 <p>
  In that case, I had to take this risk.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;……Are you serious?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Understood.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The silent Yurnet replied.
 </p>
 <p>
  Good.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took out the highest-grade Advent Stone from my pocket.

 <p>
  Bring it on.
 </p>
 <p>
  A stronger engraving.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is not enough to even tickle me.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Notification!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Advent Dungeon is over. Press the ‘Exit’ button.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “F*** off.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I threw the rainbow-colored stone at the Black Dragon’s corpse.
 </p>
 <p>
  A black hand emerged from the blood pool next to the corpse and swallowed the stone.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Warning!]

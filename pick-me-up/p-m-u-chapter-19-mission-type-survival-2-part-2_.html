 <p>
  We completed our makeshift barriers by stacking objects around us, forming small fortifications. As I glanced back, I saw Aaron, Zeeth, and Hanson doing the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kyaaa!”
 </p>

 <p>
  Finally, the goblins had spotted us.
 </p>
 <p>
  [29:59]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Here they come.’
 </p>
 <p>
  This mission isn’t just about protecting myself. If one side gets breached, everyone in the open area will be in danger.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I have no choice but to trust Jenna.’
 </p>
 <p>
  At first glance, her role may seem the most unnecessary, but the reality is quite different.
 </p>
 <p>
  Given the nature of this mission, we’ll inevitably reach our physical limits. If Jenna doesn’t fill in the gaps, the defenses will crumble instantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kiaaaaack!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The goblins began to surge into the alleyway.
 </p>
 <p>
  I thrust my sword through the gaps in the stacked wood, piercing a goblin’s neck as I passed. The goblin collapsed, blood flowing from its throat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stack the bodies! Build the wall!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I repeated the instructions so that my companions could hear.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Then I heard Aaron and Zeeth’s distant shouts.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the clash of spears continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  One strike, one goblin.
 </p>
 <p>
  We should Aim for their chests or heads. So I diligently stabbed my sword through the gaps.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kii, kii, kiiii!”
 </p>

 <p>
  The goblins also thrust their weapons through the gaps in the barricade.
 </p>
 <p>
  I Blocked and countered, swiftly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Another one fell.
 </p>
 <p>
  Beyond the alleyway, on the main road, a horde of goblins had gathered, so numerous that counting them was futile. They seemed eager to get ahead, pushing and shoving each other into the narrow alleys.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘How foolish…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Some of the goblins must have realized that the fallen bodies obstructed their path. They dragged several corpses out of the alleyway. Despite the narrowness of the passage, the goblins’ small frames enabled them to do so.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kyaaa!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A goblin at the forefront thrust its weapon.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s the same frequent pattern. So I Blocked and countered again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, a cunning goblin beneath me started dismantling the barrier. I struck its head with my shield through a gap, and blood splattered from its shattered skull.
 </p>

 <p>
  I glanced back.
 </p>
 <p>
  The other three thrust their blades through the gaps in the barrier, never retreating.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If it gets too tough, let me know!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna shouted from the open area.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘We still have a long way to go.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I raised my sword and slashed, severing a goblin’s arm. The arm flew through the air as the goblin with the missing limb swung its other hand with sharp claws, aiming for the barricade and tearing through a leather armguard.
 </p>
 <p>
  I thrust my sword into its head.
 </p>
 <p>
  Immediately, the goblin behind it dragged away the corpse.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sigh, you idiots, seriously.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If they look stupid, they’ll act stupid.

 <p>
  They’re gradually learning. When the front goblin dies, the others wait and then drag the bodies out of the alley. Some even crouched down, gradually pushing stones or wooden planks outside. There was even one who stepped on their comrade’s shoulder to pass through the passage. The path slowly opened up.
 </p>
 <p>
  [26:48]
 </p>
 <p>
  I forgot to count the dead goblins after the tenth one.
 </p>
 <p>
  These guys are weak. They’re like fledglings who would only appear on the first floor. Their bodies are emaciated, and their strength is lacking.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, their numbers are overwhelming.
 </p>
 <p>
  Excessively so.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kii, kiiii!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The tip of my sword tore through a goblin’s eye, and it let out a desperate scream. The goblin staggered, twisting its body as it tumbled along with the others behind it.
 </p>
 <p>
  The goblins amassed on the main road show no sign of dwindling.
 </p>
 <p>
  Do these creatures feel no fear? Reluctantly, they press forward as if they have a death wish.

 <p>
  More than half of the barricade has been dismantled.
 </p>
 <p>
  I swiftly pulled my right foot back.
 </p>
 <p>
  A goblin, squeezing its body through a gap in the barricade, struck where my right foot had been with a dagger. I swiftly drove my sword down onto the back of its head.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked back.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the right, Aaron efficiently dealt with the goblins, gripping his spear at a shorter length.
 </p>
 <p>
  The disparity in skill is overwhelming. So far, he’s been performing admirably.
 </p>
 <p>
  Below, Zeeth was drenched in sweat, gasping for breath.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Zeeth, switch!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, I can still…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Quiet, switch!”
 </p>

 <p>
  “You rest! I’ll handle it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Hanson, who had been waiting, swiftly rushed out with his sword and shield.
 </p>
 <p>
  Zeeth retreated into the open area, catching his breath.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘His stamina is still low.’
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s why I positioned Zeeth and Hanson in the same group. They not only have lower levels but also lack sufficient skills. Whether due to battle excitement or tension, they exert excessive strength with each attack.
 </p>
 <p>
  They tire easily.
 </p>
 <p>
  They’re still inexperienced, one well-placed sword strike is enough.
 </p>
 <p>
  One at a time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Relax the body, and swing smoothly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Maximize efficiency with minimal effort.

 <p>
  Thrust,
 </p>
 <p>
  Slash,
 </p>
 <p>
  Thrust again.
 </p>
 <p>
  The rate at which the corpses pile up begins to outpace the goblins’ clearing speed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [22:58]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Switch again!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hanson!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, got it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Hanson switched with Zeeth.
 </p>
 <p>
  The barricade they were in charge of below is nearly breached. Dozens of tightly packed goblins fill the passage beyond. Some are trampled to death, but there’s no sign of concern.
 </p>

 <p>
  ‘That area is the most dangerous!’
 </p>
 <p>
  I attempted to call Jenna.
 </p>
 <p>
  One person defends while the other reinforces the barricade.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kii!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A goblin’s head appeared on the high wall of the open area.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t let them cross over!” I shouted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You got it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ping!
 </p>
 <p>
  An arrow pierced through the goblin’s head. The goblin, attempting to climb over the wall, fell flat onto the inside of the open area.
 </p>
 <p>
  Goblins on the opposite side were climbing the wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jenna, you handle the goblins trying to enter the open area! Understand?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A goblin extended its head from the wall on the opposite side.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna’s arrow once again pierced through its forehead.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Retrieve the arrows!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna swiftly ran to the corpse and pulled out the arrow. Meanwhile, another goblin was climbing the wall on the opposite side.
 </p>
 <p>
  If we allow those creatures to invade the open area, we’ll be surrounded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hyung-nim, didn’t you say we only need to survive for 10 minutes?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Dude, it’s only been 5 minutes!”

  “Aaack!”

 <p>
  Zeeth suddenly held his hand, writhing in pain.
 </p>
 <p>
  Two fingers on his left hand had been severed, and blood spurted out.

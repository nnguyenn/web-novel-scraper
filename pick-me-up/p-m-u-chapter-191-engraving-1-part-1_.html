 <p>
  The day after clearing the Advent Dungeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet’s nagging parade continued. Why did I take on such a reckless challenge? What would have happened if I had died? I had to listen to her lecture for about two hours. Since there was nothing wrong with what she said, I quietly listened.

 <p>
  If things had gone even slightly wrong, I would have died, making all my previous efforts meaningless.
 </p>
 <p>
  A high rank and rarity don’t necessarily mean a good engraving. Just like a hero’s birth, it’s all about how you use it.
 </p>
 <p>
  I did get greedy.
 </p>
 <p>
  If I had known that the engraving I risked my life to obtain was only A-grade, I would have reconsidered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anyway, I used up all my stacks of weapon summons, and unless it’s a very unusual case, I will have to fight with my own strength from now on. I didn’t want to bring Niflheimr into small-scale disputes among masters. I didn’t want to instill bad habits in Anytng, who had found his resolve.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Black Dragon Blood.’
 </p>
 <p>
  That is the name of the engraving I obtained yesterday.
 </p>
 <p>
  I planned to embed the engraving today and test it out.
 </p>
 <p>
  However…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Neigh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A gray horse raised its head and neighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha approached the horse, holding a bundle of hay in her arms.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sorry, Gandalf. It’s feeding time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When Kishasha placed the hay in the horse’s trough, Gandalf started devouring it hungrily.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Eat up. There’s plenty more.”
 </p>
 <p>
  On the second floor of Townia.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was in the stable, an auxiliary facility of the time and space rift.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha was busy feeding the animals in the stable. She diligently carried hay, swept the dirty floor with a broom, and replaced the water in the troughs.

 <p>
  “Need help?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No. It’s my hobby.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha, with a serious expression, swept the hay on the floor with a rake.
 </p>
 <p>
  I could only watch from the corner. She would absolutely refuse any help.
 </p>
 <p>
  Taking care of the animals in the stable was her only remaining hobby. She said she had raised many animals in her hometown as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The third floor dorm is gone too.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The forest and village on the third floor of the waiting room, which had a similar environment to Kishasha’s hometown, had been dismantled a long time ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, since she wants to do it, I don’t want to interfere. I sat down on a pile of hay and watched Kishasha busily working.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  I’m not here because I want to be.
 </p>

 <p>
  To embed the engraving, I needed a place where I could be alone.
 </p>
 <p>
  The mansion on the fourth floor where I stayed was a mess due to remodeling. I had planned to embed the engraving in my room, but Neryssa practically kicked me out. The training center was the same. It was undergoing facility upgrades. For facilities above a certain level, expansion takes time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Therefore, the only place where there wouldn’t be anyone around at this time was here, the stable.
 </p>
 <p>
  I could do it at dawn, but including the test time, it might be delayed. It was currently the time when Anytng wasn’t logged in.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll finish this quickly and leave.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha mumbled while refilling the water trough in the stable.
 </p>
 <p>
  She seemed to know why I was here.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘For now… three horses.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked around the stable.
 </p>
 <p>
  Currently, Townia has three horses.
 </p>

  Each was Gandalf, Saruman, and Radagast. They were captured by Jenna and Kishasha in the weekly dungeon. As the scale of missions gradually increases, the number of necessary horses will also increase. In higher-level missions, there will be not only horses but also other mounts.
 </p>
 <p>
  “By the way…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I pointed to an animal bustling in the corner of the stable.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha smiled and approached the animal.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I forgot to feed you. Let’s eat!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Coo… Coo…”
 </p>
 <p>
  A chubby pigeon fluttered around Kishasha.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I brought it from the dimensional city. It followed me to the airship when I fed it. Isn’t it cute?”

 <p>
  The pigeon began pecking at the feed frantically.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pigeon, my foot. It’s more like a chicken pigeon. It was so fat that its neck was almost invisible.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Its name is Goo Goo Corn.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Goo Goo Corn?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Doesn’t it coo~? Huhuhu.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha patted the pigeon’s head lovingly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The pigeon didn’t care, busy eating the feed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Coo, coo…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I decided to respect her tastes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha’s beast base should be a tiger.

  She was the one who calmly ate raw meat during mealtime. Katiio was horrified to see her tearing into the hind leg of a deer, dripping with blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s a wonder she doesn’t eat it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s fat enough.
 </p>
 <p>
  Come to think of it, it’s been a while since I had chicken.
 </p>
 <p>
  I thought it would taste good if fried.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Coo…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The pigeon looked up at me and shuddered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha also glared at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Han, you aren’t thinking anything bad, are you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you talking about.”
 </p>

 <p>
  She has sharp intuition.
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled and crossed my arms.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Goo Goo Corn was eating, Kishasha cleaned the birdhouse and filled the feed trough. She wiped the sweat from her forehead. It seemed she was almost done.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m leaving. Don’t do anything weird.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry. I won’t touch it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a refreshed face, Kishasha left the stable.
 </p>
 <p>
  She seemed to have relieved some stress. Fighting for a long time inevitably builds up stress. If not relieved in time, it can lead to poor conditions. Each member of Party 1, including myself, had a hobby to relieve stress.
 </p>
 <p>
  For now.

  She seemed to have relieved some stress. Fighting for a long time inevitably builds up stress. If not relieved in time, it can lead to poor conditions. Each member of Party 1, including myself, had a hobby to relieve stress.
 </p>
 <p>
  For now.

 <p>
  I took out a leather pouch.
 </p>
 <p>
  I opened the pouch and poured its contents onto the floor. A black bead rolled out.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the advent stone of the Black Dragon Blood. Next to it was a recovery potion prepared for emergencies.
 </p>
 <p>
  I locked the stable door.
 </p>
 <p>
  This wasn’t something to show others.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Coo! Coo coo!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Neigh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Should I just do it tomorrow.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I shook my head. Time is precious.
 </p>
 <p>
  To get used to the engraving, I needed to try it as soon as possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Hah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After taking a deep breath, I reached out for the advent stone.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Starting engraving!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Advent stone used – True Black Dragon Blood (A)]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Target hero – Han (★★★★)]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Success rate – Unknown]
 </p>
 <p>
  The inscription window appeared in my view.
 </p>
 <p>
  [※Warning!]

 <p>
  [Engraving can fail, and a failed hero will fall into a state of corruption. Are you sure you want to proceed with the engraving?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  Along with a loud noise, a warning message popped up.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the engraving fails, your hero is done for.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s roughly what it meant.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how skilled a hero was before, if they failed here, it would be over in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  Corrupted heroes almost never return. I had lost many promising candidates to promotion and engraving before.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s a matter of mental strength.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Heroes trained through actual combat rarely fall into corruption.
 </p>
 <p>
  To reach the 100th floor, this level of challenge should be overcome. After taking one last deep breath, I touched the hologram.

 <p>
  [Yes (selected) / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  Then I placed my left hand on the surface of the advent stone.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The engraving begins!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The process requires some time.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Please wait.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Vuuuuung.
 </p>
 <p>
  The advent stone began to vibrate.
 </p>
 <p>
  A cold energy started to flow into my fingertips.
 </p>
 <p>
  It felt like my veins were freezing.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Hahaha… You have started.&gt;
 </p>

 <p>
  A familiar voice echoed in my ear.
 </p>
 <p>
  A deep, domineering voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  It belonged to the black dragon I fought yesterday.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;I have been watching you. You have a different scent from the other insignificant humans. Yes, the scent of that emperor.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle, crackle.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dark red lightning started to shoot from my left hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  But there was almost no pain.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;I know you are not ordinary.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  …Is there no mute function?
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Where did you come from, and what are you trying to do? What can you do in this broken place?&gt;
 </p>

 <p>
  Slowly, I began to feel the sensation in my left arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hot yet cold. A feeling I had never experienced before.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;I made a pact with the emperor in ancient times. Yes, from now…&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just shut up. I’m not interested in your story at all.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Hahaha! Treating ancient secrets so lightly! Truly a hero! This performance was worth it.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  He seems to be having strange delusions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ignoring his voice, I focused on my arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dark red lightning was burning on my entire left arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So this is where the engraving is.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It meant the skill would start from the left arm.
 </p>

 <p>
  I should keep this in mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Neigh! Neigh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Coo… Coo coo!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sensing something, the animals started to cry loudly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially Goo Goo Corn, who flapped its wings and fluttered around me annoyingly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle. Crackle.
 </p>
 <p>
  The lightning on my left arm subsided.
 </p>
 <p>
  I squinted my eyes. A noticeable change occurred.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Scales began to sprout from my left forearm.
 </p>

 <p>
  A vivid jet-black sheen. They were the black dragon’s scales.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the scales soon disappeared, returning to normal skin.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle.
 </p>
 <p>
  The lightning subsided.
 </p>
 <p>
  I rotated my left arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  It moved normally.
 </p>
 <p>
  The engraving seemed almost complete.
 </p>
 <p>
  Except for the noisy chatter from one creature, there were no other problems so far.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Han Istrat.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “What.”

 <p>
  &lt;Thank you for giving me this opportunity. With your vessel, it is possible.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Opportunity?
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Yes. You have passed the test. With you…&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;I can become whole again!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle, crackle!
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, a blinding flash erupted from my left arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  The flash formed a bolt of lightning that shot into the air, forming the shape of a small dragon.
 </p>
 <p>
  The dragon roared.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Hahaha! Consider it an honor to become my vessel!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  [Danger!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★★★★)’ is beginning to be corrupted!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The lightning pierced back into my left arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  But this time, the sensation was different from before.
 </p>
 <p>
  A searing pain, as if my veins were being torn apart, climbed up my left arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Don’t worry. I’ll use your body well. Despite being a lowly human, your vessel is excellent. Lucky me! Haha!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;You fool!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle, crackle!
 </p>
 <p>
  The lightning that reached my shoulder aimed for my heart.

  I quickly took the recovery potion I had opened and reached for the sheath.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Somehow.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Huh?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “It is too easy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  I drew my sword with my right hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s merely a substitute for Bifrost, but it isn’t completely without resistance to corruption.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Wait, what are you…&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Crunch.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no hesitation.
 </p>

 <p>
  I plunged the blade into my shoulder.
 </p>
 <p>
  My vision momentarily turned red, and my head spun.
 </p>
 <p>
  But this level of pain…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ve experienced it more than once.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I brought my right hand to the lightning hovering around my shoulder.
 </p>
 <p>
  Blisters formed on my palm, and my skin started to peel, but I forced myself to endure it.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;How dare you…!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Snap.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sound of muscle fibers tearing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, the flesh on my shoulder began to peel away.
 </p>
 <p>
  I gritted my teeth and tore the lightning from my shoulder.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Don’t resist! I, a great being, will save Townia in your place. All you have to do is hand over your body!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle, crackle!
 </p>
 <p>
  I pulled at the lightning.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Do you think you can resist? My blood already flows through your body.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;I acknowledge your willpower. But it’s useless resistance. You will succumb. I have been trapped for thousands of years. No more. So give me…&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The dragon’s eyes appeared in the lightning.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at my left arm. The torn skin was healing rapidly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even after pulling out the lightning, the engraving remained in my body.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Coo… Coo coo…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Neigh! Neigh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The animals were going wild.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took a breath.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I pulled the sword out of my left arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before the blood spurted out, scales formed, blocking the wound.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;You fool! Pulling out that sword means your end!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Gripping the still-burning lightning in my right hand, I stood up.
 </p>
 <p>
  I stomped on the frenzied pigeon next to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then I grasped the lightning.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Coo…?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Huh?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The eyes of the dragon and the pigeon met.

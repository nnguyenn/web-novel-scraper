  Just in time, Anytng was selecting the party for the mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  [1st Party! Assemble!]

 <p>
  As expected, it’s the 1st Party.
 </p>
 <p>
  I met Velkist at the training ground exit.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was almost the first time facing him since we returned from the dimensional city.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had been holed up somewhere and hadn’t come out at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Long time no see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. How have you been?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Doesn’t look like it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The shock from Aaron must have been great.
 </p>
 <p>
  We descended to the plaza on the second floor where the Rift of Time and Space was located.
 </p>
 <p>
  We were able to join Jenna, Kishasha, and Katiio on the stairs.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s mission time again. Let’s all do our best.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the Rift.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna looked around at the members with a smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ve gained new powers. It should be easier this time, right? Yay!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna kicked off the wall and leaped agilely.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then she stomped in the air again. Jenna’s body leaped higher once more. Double jump. She scattered five apples from her pouch, then took out her short bow and drew the string.
 </p>
 <p>
  Papapapapak!
 </p>

 <p>
  The arrows, each curving on a different trajectory, pierced through the apples.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Success!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh! Impressive.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio clapped, and Jenna scratched her head awkwardly.
 </p>
 <p>
  She had also acquired an engraving.
 </p>
 <p>
  The top-grade Advent Stone wasn’t the only item we got from the event.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna’s engraving was called ‘Blessing of the Wind Arrow.’ It was a versatile C-grade engraving that bestowed wind attributes to her body and arrows.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve been thinking about it, and I think I’m a genius. New techniques keep coming to mind… Ow ow ow!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stop showing off. The mission is about to start.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was just trying to lighten the mood!”

  I know.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks to Jenna, everyone’s expressions were slightly relaxed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Main Dungeon, current challenge floor is 42.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The door will open in 10 seconds. Prepare!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The central mirror began to shine.
 </p>
 <p>
  The challenge floor is 42.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It feels a bit different from when we knew nothing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna muttered, her smile gone.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course.
 </p>
 <p>
  Until 3-star, we carried out missions just to survive, but from 4-star onward, we fought knowing the reason through the promotion ceremony.

 </p>
 <p>
  “I fight for my dead kin. I don’t care about the Beast King or whatever.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t really care.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Three of them spoke in succession.
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio and I stood silently.
 </p>
 <p>
  “….”
 </p>
 <p>
  I haven’t changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The reason for fighting, even after knowing the truth, didn’t change.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s to live, to return.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if the ones I’ve killed and will kill were once heroes.

  Even if their hearts for Townia haven’t changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can’t be a hero.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I have no intention of doing so.
 </p>
 <p>
  I gripped my scabbard.
 </p>
 <p>
  Light enveloped my body.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Floor 42.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Mission Type – Extermination]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Objective – Annihilate the enemies!]
 </p>
 <p>
  A hot wind brushed my cheek.
 </p>
 <p>
  I opened my eyes. Everything was burning.

  Among the flames, I heard screams and the sound of clashing weapons.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sreung!
 </p>
 <p>
  No words were needed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Everyone drew their weapons and formed a circle around Katiio.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a basic formation centered on the magician.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You can tell just by looking, right? This time it’s an extermination. Kill everything in sight.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Simple and good.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist grinned.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I wonder where this is.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I pointed to the flag fluttering beyond the wall of flames.

  A lion holding a sword in its mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the insignia of the Assinis army.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Looks like they’re getting wiped out again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  They seemed to be ambushed at night.
 </p>
 <p>
  Countless large and small tents were burning.
 </p>
 <p>
  The so-called martial arts family was constantly in trouble.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Black Knight Lv.45] X 27
 </p>
 <p>
  Slash!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kuaaah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the black knight on horseback swung his greatsword, the upper body of the severed soldier floated in the air.

 <p>
  It was a beast-like monstrous strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  Such beings, dozens of them.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were slaughtering the soldiers in groups.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt; Kill the traitors…! &gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt; Our enemies… enemies… &gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Find that woman. She must be hiding somewhere!”
 </p>
 <p>
  In the center of the black knights.
 </p>
 <p>
  A middle-aged man in black armor wielded a giant halberd.
 </p>
 <p>
  Muscles bulged explosively from outside his armor, and dark red veins throbbed near his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Danger!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [3rd Guard Vice-Captain]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Darkhan the Crusher Lv.51]
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the guy I saw in the palace.
 </p>
 <p>
  The knight who was beside the prince.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ignore the small fry. Kill that woman and it’s over!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The man glared and swung his halberd.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No need to go, it seems.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist said lazily.
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The situation was the exact opposite of the 40th floor.

 <p>
  The black knights and the man were outnumbered.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how monstrous they were, the difference in numbers was extreme. The black knights fell one by one.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You know nothing, you know nothing! That woman, what she did, what happened to Townia!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What nonsense is this madman spouting!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kill him! Surround and kill!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally, all the black knights fell,
 </p>
 <p>
  and only the man remained.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Priasis, that woman, she…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Before the man could open his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sprang like lightning.

 <p>
  Then, I kicked off the tent post and leaped several meters.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★★★★)’ has entered Ascend mode!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Skill ‘Soulblade Fusion’ activated!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Unique Skill ‘Black Dragon Scales’ activated!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Combined Skill ‘Dragon Slicer’ is cast!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack!
 </p>
 <p>
  The man’s body shattered into pieces along with a burst of blood.

 <p>
  I had to set action guidelines based on the situation. The actual forces we could deploy were Edis’ first assault team and the first party.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s see…”

 <p>
  I picked up a quill pen over the map.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then again.
 </p>
 <p>
  The next morning arrived.
 </p>
 <p>
  After a simple breakfast, I donned my armor and strapped on my sword. I wanted to let them handle it on their own, but there were basic duties to attend to.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was the only one attending.
 </p>
 <p>
  The other members were scheduled to join in the evening with other parties.
 </p>
 <p>
  The meeting place was Delphin’s large three-story tent.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed I was the last one, as there was no one outside.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stop.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Two soldiers guarding the entrance blocked my way.
 </p>
 <p>
  I presented the pass Delphin had given me. The soldier scrutinized the pass and my face before speaking.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you Han Israt?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Enter.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The spears blocking my way were lifted.
 </p>
 <p>
  What’s with these guys?
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the faces of the two.
 </p>
 <p>
  Both had strange eyes. Like a swamp.

 <p>
  They were cloudy and dull.
 </p>
 <p>
  I entered the tent.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no one inside the spacious interior.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not even a mouse.
 </p>
 <p>
  The meeting place was a private room on the third floor of the tent.
 </p>
 <p>
  I climbed the stairs to the upper floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, no one.
 </p>
 <p>
  The guards and maids I had seen last time were all gone.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then.
 </p>
 <p>
  A familiar smell reached my nose.
 </p>

 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  I quickened my pace.
 </p>
 <p>
  Up to the third floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  The higher I climbed, the stronger the smell became.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hoho.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A woman’s high-pitched laughter echoed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So much for being the strongest in the Empire.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I put my hand on the hilt of my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ready to draw at any moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  I silently walked down the hallway on the third floor of the tent.
 </p>

 <p>
  “That proud white dragon blood, the Asinia’s prowess, is this all there is?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Squelch.
 </p>
 <p>
  Blood spurted from a heap of flesh that seemed to be a human arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  The blood stained the white carpet in the hallway red, flowing up to my feet.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……Ha.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I rubbed my forehead. The hallway was filled with a mountain of human corpses.
 </p>
 <p>
  None of them were intact. It was impossible to tell gender, build, or age. All were chopped into pieces as if put through a blender.
 </p>
 <p>
  I found a familiar ring in the corner of the hallway.
 </p>
 <p>
  I picked up the ring. The surface, covered in blood, had an inscription in elegant letters: “Left hand of the White Dragon, Radasteri.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I scrutinized the heap of flesh.

 <p>
  Amid the mess of bones, organs, and flesh, I found fragments of a silver armor.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was obvious whose it was.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dead.
 </p>
 <p>
  No signs of resistance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Slaughtered in an instant, along with everyone here.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s why you should have given up when I asked nicely. Abandoning the great prince and clinging to that traitorous wench?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The woman’s voice came from beyond the door.
 </p>
 <p>
  From the private room on the third floor of the tent where the strategy meeting was to be held.
 </p>
 <p>
  I quietly stood against the wall beside the door and drew my sword.

 <p>
  “All at once? Or slowly?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I thought for a moment, then concluded it was meaningless.
 </p>
 <p>
  The reaction of the soldiers outside and the voice echoing in the hallway.
 </p>
 <p>
  I already knew.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Damn it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  This is how it is for me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Never easy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  I kicked the door open.
 </p>
 <p>
  The door burst open with splintered wood, revealing the scene inside the private room.

 <p>
  “Ugh, huff, cough…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Someone was crawling on the floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Their clothes were almost completely torn, leaving them half-naked.
 </p>
 <p>
  Half of their white hair was burnt, and a blood-soaked face peeked through a broken mask.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was Delphin.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Crawl. Yes, keep crawling. Crawl like a bug! Hahaha!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A woman in a dark blue robe was watching from behind.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Danger!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Head of Shutenberg]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Perseine Riedel von Strabern Lv.???]

 <p>
  The woman’s eyes, filled with madness, turned to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her blood-red lips curved into a smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Look who it is. Our hero.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The woman approached Delphin and lightly gestured.
 </p>
 <p>
  Delphin’s body floated as if caught by an invisible hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was just in the middle of an execution. Perfect timing, hero. You’re about to witness the fall of the so-called strongest in the Empire. It’s quite a sight.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let go! You bastard, I am of the Asinia… Aaaaagh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Crunch.
 </p>
 <p>
  One of Delphine’s broken horns fell to the floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  The woman, Perseine, who had torn off the horn, spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Our hero doesn’t even blink in this situation. Is it because you’ve been through so many fierce battles?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Head of Shutenberg.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The name tag was displayed.
 </p>
 <p>
  In her hand was the sharp fragment of the horn.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Watch closely.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Perseine grinned.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thunk!
 </p>
 <p>
  She stabbed the horn into Delphin’s heart.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh!”

 <p>
  Blood spurted from Delphin’s mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the same time, I rolled on the floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  Delphin’s body brushed past where I had been standing.
 </p>
 <p>
  She twitched, embedded deeply in the wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I command you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Die.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Perseine pointed,
 </p>
 <p>
  Crunch!
 </p>
 <p>
  Delphine turned into a bloodied mess.

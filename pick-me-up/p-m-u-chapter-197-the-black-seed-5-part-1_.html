  Ping!
 </p>
 <p>
  The dagger shot out from my left hand and embedded itself into the chest of the saintess.

 <p>
  Taking advantage of her stumbling, I pushed off the ground and ran backwards. I had no time to deal with them; finding Pria was my top priority.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘All of them are boss-level monsters.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A woman who fires magic like a machine gun, a beastman with immense strength, and even a saintess with strange powers.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had seen them as major figures in the promotion ceremony, but I never expected them all to appear here together. If it was one by one, maybe, but against three, I couldn’t guarantee victory.
 </p>
 <p>
  I moved towards the outskirts of the camp and looked back.
 </p>
 <p>
  They seemed to be dealing with the troops first, as they were no longer chasing me.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the distance, I saw thousands of soldiers being swept away.
 </p>
 <p>
  I scanned the area.
 </p>
 <p>
  Beyond the hill where the camp’s entrance was, I saw units among the fluttering flags.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the church’s army.
  <br/>
  (T/N: I’m using Church instead of Cult from now on.)
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Maybe they were never a match from the beginning.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I thought they might be somewhat useful.
 </p>
 <p>
  I clicked my tongue lightly and increased my speed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Church Army Soldier Lv.25] X 32
 </p>
 <p>
  [Church Army Knight Lv.28] X 2
 </p>
 <p>
  The church’s forces had already infiltrated the whole area.
 </p>
 <p>
  I kicked away one rushing at me and stabbed his chest with my sword. Then, I cut down three more in succession and headed for Pria’s tent.
 </p>
 <p>
  I lifted the entrance flap.

  ‘……She’s not here.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The interior was neatly organized.
 </p>
 <p>
  It didn’t seem like she had been here and left.
 </p>
 <p>
  This meant she wasn’t in the tent when the invasion occurred.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Where could Pria have gone…….’
 </p>
 <p>
  There was only one place that came to mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned and headed towards the path leading to the cliff.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Save me! Please, save me!”
 </p>
 <p>
  There, too, the massacre continued.

 <p>
  Soldiers were screaming in despair, swinging their swords.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were killing and being killed by each other in terror.
 </p>
 <p>
  Friendly fire.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;How interesting.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  In the midst of the screams and scattered corpses, the saintess stood. With each flash of violet light from her half-open left eye, the soldiers’ movements became more intense.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;I am Irine Icario. The 38th Saintess of the Tel Ikar Church…….&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  My sword pierced the saintess’s heart.
 </p>
 <p>
  I threw the saintess into the bushes. Her body, spraying blood, wriggled on the dirt.
 </p>
 <p>
  The scattered blood was gathering into the hole in her heart.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had pierced her vital point with a blade, yet here she was, appearing unharmed.

 <p>
  ‘Regeneration?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Spitting out blood-mixed saliva, I ran again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Good thing I didn’t deactivate my Ascend state. I almost got caught again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her technique seemed to be a type of magic eye. Likely some form of control magic.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ll keep that in mind for when I face her again later.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gradually, a fog spread before my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  From within the fog came the sounds of screams and clashing weapons.
 </p>
 <p>
  I loosely gripped my blood-stained sword hilt and leaped in.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria, holding a rapier, was struggling against five soldiers.
 </p>

 <p>
  However, she was outmatched. A thick spear blade grazed Pria’s forearm. She groaned and dropped her sword. Various weapons aimed at her vital points.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…….’
 </p>
 <p>
  I intervened just then.
 </p>
 <p>
  I spun my body as I approached Pria. The circular sword strike split two spear blades and one axe in half. Then, I kicked one who was about to stab Pria with a dagger and swung my left hand. I caught the sword aiming for Pria’s neck. Pulling the sword towards me, I disarmed the soldier. And then.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack.
 </p>
 <p>
  The five soldiers fell simultaneously, their bodies shattered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Whew.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I shook my left hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Blood was seeping out from the outside of my hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Han……!”

  “Why so surprised? It’s not the first time. Skip the greetings. Just by looking, you can tell the situation isn’t good.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s…… happening?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The church’s army invaded and is causing chaos. We’re getting thrashed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I steadied my breath.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han(★★★★)’s Ascend state has been deactivated.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Staggering, I managed to suppress the pain and dizziness.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then we must fight back! Where is Sir Delphin……!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Follow me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Eek!”
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no time to explain.

  I grabbed Pria’s wrist and led her out of there.
 </p>
 <p>
  If we took the left path from the camp, we’d reach the landing zone. I planned to hijack an airship and escape into the sky from there.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But…….’
 </p>
 <p>
  I held my forehead.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the distance, flames were rising from the landing zone.
 </p>
 <p>
  A few airships that had taken off were also turning into fireballs and crashing down.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Damn.’
 </p>
 <p>
  “Han!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Then where should we go?
 </p>
 <p>
  If we exit through another part of the camp, it leads to the plains.
 </p>

 <p>
  Though spacious, it’s wide open and not suitable for escaping.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There’s no other choice.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With the landing zone blocked, the plains were the only option.
 </p>
 <p>
  I pulled Pria’s wrist and changed direction.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I said let go of my hand. I will follow.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Fine.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I released her hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria rubbed her wrist, tears welling in her eyes, and looked at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You have the key, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I always keep it with me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stick close to me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The main force of the church’s army seemed to have entered the camp as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  Wherever we went, there was blood, and screams echoed loudly.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a one-sided massacre.
 </p>
 <p>
  I moved, hiding my body among the trees and bushes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria followed awkwardly behind me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is…… happening…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Ahaha! Die, die!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang! Bang bang bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  Persene was firing magic bullets from the sky.

  Pria’s face turned pale.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That is…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Glad to see her again?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The calm and composed Sir Persene is acting like…… Mm!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I covered Pria’s mouth.

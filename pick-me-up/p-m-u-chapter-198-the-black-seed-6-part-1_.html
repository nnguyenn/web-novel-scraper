  Drip.
 </p>
 <p>
  A drop of water fell from the tip of a stalactite.

 <p>
  I looked up. A faint light seeped through a hole in the ceiling.
 </p>
 <p>
  The temperature was cooler than expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was cold enough that without extra layers of clothing, one would feel chilly.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sat on a protruding rock in the corner of the cave and gulped down a potion.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was my second bottle.
 </p>
 <p>
  With this, I had exhausted all the healing potions I had.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the throbbing pain that seemed to come from deep inside my body, likely due to the prolonged use of Ascend, remained unchanged.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked to the side.
 </p>
 <p>
  In front of the lake in the middle of the cave, Pria was crouched, sitting.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The troops….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They must be annihilated.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I answered briefly.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no point in hiding the truth.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Assinis army dispatched to the floating island to retrieve the key had been completely wiped out.
 </p>
 <p>
  All the key officers, including Delphin, had been killed, and the remaining forces at the camp had been massacred without a central command. They were now non-existent.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is troublesome.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I brought the empty potion bottle to my mouth.
 </p>

 <p>
  The escape mission had succeeded somehow. Knowing the escape route in advance when scouting the camp and planning at the lodging was a huge help.
 </p>
 <p>
  The floating island Asrank had an underground passage almost as vast as the surface.
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the hundreds of entrances was on a cliff. However, the cliff where the cave was located was sharply cut, so I had to perform a near-acrobatic feat of climbing from thousands of meters above ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  I put down the potion bottle.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though the escape was successful, I couldn’t return to the waiting room, and the dimensional gate didn’t open either.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was still trapped here.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is this still a personal mission?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked to the right side of my field of vision.
 </p>
 <p>
  The mission objective window, which should have been there, was empty.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were no floor or objective notifications.
 </p>

 <p>
  I had experienced unknown missions before, but never to this extent.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even the stage clear message hadn’t appeared. I had no idea what floor I was on or what type of mission this was.
 </p>
 <p>
  What is this?
 </p>
 <p>
  I bit my lip.
 </p>
 <p>
  Three boss-level entities had appeared simultaneously, and fragments of the series that would normally appear on the 80th floor or higher had appeared. This exceeded any difficult levels.
 </p>
 <p>
  It could be called a bug.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Didn’t she say something about transcending?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I recalled Perseine’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  Transcending. Liberating all who suffer.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the current situation was intended, they were clearly irregulars.

 <p>
  ‘This is… a headache.’
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no improvement at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was impossible to summon the members of the waiting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no contact.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed I had to proceed with the mission as it was.
 </p>
 <p>
  Without being able to receive supplies like potions.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘For now….’
 </p>
 <p>
  I held my throbbing head.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had to organize the tasks I needed to do and prioritize them.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no time to dawdle.

 <p>
  If the monster inside the egg awakened, the situation would become much worse.
 </p>
 <p>
  Time was not on my side.
 </p>
 <p>
  I compiled the information I had heard from Delphin, Adel, and Pria.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though the mission window wasn’t visible, I could roughly grasp the objective.
 </p>
 <p>
  Collect the last key somewhere underground and return the egg on the surface to its original place. The time limit is before that thing hatches.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The problem is….’
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t engage in a direct confrontation.
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t guarantee a win against even one of the three.
 </p>
 <p>
  If only the bosses were present, it would be somewhat manageable. But they commanded thousands of soldiers.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the other hand, I couldn’t even summon the members of my party.

 <p>
  I’m sure they also know the mission objective.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s why they weren’t chasing me directly but waiting for me in a suitable location.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was the one in a hurry.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Phew.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A sigh escaped naturally.
 </p>
 <p>
  It had been a while since I felt like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No answer.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A direct confrontation was impossible.
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t call for support.
 </p>
 <p>
  What was I supposed to do?
 </p>

 <p>
  Was I supposed to perform a suicide attack?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘At least if there were any surviving troops….’
 </p>
 <p>
  If there were survivors from the expedition troop, I could use them as bait and infiltrate.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, judging by the camp’s situation, the probability of survivors was close to zero.
 </p>
 <p>
  The enemy’s forces consisted of well-trained soldiers numbering in the thousands and three monsters that surpassed the standard.
 </p>
 <p>
  And on this side… there was only a 4-star hero and a non-combat NPC.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I wonder what Anytng would think.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If he logged in in the evening, he would be able to grasp the situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  How the mission was going.
 </p>
 <p>
  After that, he might send a bug report to Mobius.

 <p>
  In my thesis analyzing hundreds of missions, there had never been such a case.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s impossible.’
 </p>
 <p>
  My instincts as a master told me.
 </p>
 <p>
  The probability of success in this mission was nonexistent.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Damn it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I gritted my teeth.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, was I supposed to die here?
 </p>
 <p>
  When did I ever move based on the success rate?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Han.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned my gaze.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria’s shoulders, crouched in front of the lake, had shrunk.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What should we do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If the expedition team is annihilated, can we retrieve the key?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We won’t know until we try.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I am powerless. I’m sorry.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t look down. It’s not over yet. We have to try what we can.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m sorry.”
 </p>
 <p>
  This is frustrating.
 </p>
 <p>
  I approached Pria.

  She was crouching, hugging her knees.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her small, white hands were trembling.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll go out, so stay still. If something happens, shout.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where are you planning to go?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We need to eat.”

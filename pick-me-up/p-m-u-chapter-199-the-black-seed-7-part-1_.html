 <p>
  I recalled the scene from the 4-star promotion battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the golden palace, there was a throne. However, the figure who appeared to be the emperor did not show up.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  So I asked Neryssa, and she said that the empire had no emperor since the first one and that the de facto leader of the empire was the first heir to the throne. The position of the emperor in the empire seemed to be similar to a permanently retired position.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;That man gathered the four of us, who were in conflict and opposition, together. We had no choice but to follow him, even if we hated it. Neither they nor I wanted to die from the dimensional rift.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The sparrow closed its beak.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;In terms of sheer force, I could crush the emperor to death with just one of my claws. But we didn’t do that. He could use a power that none of us had.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;That is the golden bloddline.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The prince inherited that blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had a rough idea of what this guy wanted to say.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The emperor is…….’
 </p>
 <p>
  He could use the interference power.
 </p>
 <p>
  I folded my arms. The outline gradually began to form.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Was that man from Earth too?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Interference power.
 </p>
 <p>
  I heard about it endlessly from Yurnet.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the power to twist space-time and reverse causality in this world.
 </p>
 <p>
  The source of that power was…….
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The higher dimension.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The purpose of the game “Pick Me Up” and the reason for the master’s existence was to obtain this interference power from the higher dimension.
 </p>

 <p>
  &lt;Originally, that power was not used by anyone after the first emperor, but it seems an anomaly occurred when the prince turned into a monster.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Does that mean the blood has awakened?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Otherwise, there’s no way to explain the current situation.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  What a fantasy-like story.
 </p>
 <p>
  I clicked my tongue.
 </p>
 <p>
  The following story was as I expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  That man used interference power to merge the four torn dimensions into one. And after gathering the lives from the four dimensions into one continent, he became the first emperor of the empire.
 </p>
 <p>
  That was Townia.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Right after founding the empire, the emperor did some bizarre things to balance it out.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “What, did he marry all of you?”

 <p>
  &lt;Indeed.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  I just said it as a joke…….
 </p>
 <p>
  Besides, wasn’t this guy a man?
 </p>
 <p>
  When I saw him in the Advent Dungeon, he looked like a man in armor.
 </p>
 <p>
  As I looked at him with questioning eyes, the sparrow spread its wings.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Hmph! I am originally genderless. I can change either way. I was a man before you just out of whim.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Next time, I shall appear as a beauty so stunning that even flowers will flee. Well, if it pleases me, I might even let you enjoy the techniques that captivated the emperor, making him plead for his life every night with short breaths……&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “You don’t have to tell me that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Hoho, have I caught your interest? Since ancient times, mating is…….&gt;

 <p>
  “Chirp!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I told you to stop.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I pressed down on the sparrow’s nape.
 </p>
 <p>
  Enough with the nonsense.
 </p>
 <p>
  I got the gist.
 </p>
 <p>
  The emperor married the four ancient species that ruled each dimension and one ordinary human woman. The descendants of the ancient species became the founders of the four major families, and the descendants of the human woman became the imperial family.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had five wives.
 </p>
 <p>
  Four of them were of different species.
 </p>
 <p>
  What a weird guy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anyway, I think I know why Anytng’s account has been acting strange.

 <p>
  Townia was not just a lower dimension, and there was a special being involved in its creation. And this time…….
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Pryos Al Ragnar.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I recalled the man wrapped in red bandages.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he inherited the blood of the Earthlings and that blood awakened for some reason, it would not be impossible for him to exceed the standards.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So he became a 7-star monster.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Given his origin, there would be no need to devour a master.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, there would be a few differences from a typical 7-star hero. If they were half-hero, half-master, the prince would be half-monster, half-master.
 </p>
 <p>
  The puzzle pieces started to fit together.
 </p>
 <p>
  The reason why Delphin, who was said to be the strongest in the empire, fell so easily.
 </p>
 <p>
  Originally, she would have been the strongest in the four major families. But if the prince’s blood awakened, and if the prince could infuse his subordinates with interference power as a master does to heroes, then it would be no surprise if that magician became significantly stronger.

  “The King of Beasts and the Saintess belong to different floors, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;They are Floor Masters. Normally, they can’t descend to the 40th-floor section.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  So they are jumping between floors.
 </p>
 <p>
  Changing missions’ objectives arbitrarily too. It couldn’t be more troublesome.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Still, it doesn’t seem perfect.’
 </p>
 <p>
  They are half out of the standard, but not completely.
 </p>
 <p>
  If they had completely exceeded the standards, I would already be dead.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Han? It’s almost ready!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria’s voice echoed from the back.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seems our time for idle talk is over. I walked out with the sparrow. Meat was being roasted over the campfire.
 </p>

 <p>
  “I can’t guarantee the taste. There’s no salt…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s fine.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I took the rabbit meat skewered on a stick off the campfire.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s cooked but doesn’t taste great. The smell is strong.
 </p>
 <p>
  “By the way, aren’t you going to eat that bird?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s pitiful.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Pitiful……?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria looked at me as if she couldn’t believe it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, I have no intention of explaining. I chewed the meat.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had obtained most of the necessary information.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-12" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  I also figured out what the current mission was about.
 </p>
 <p>
  My goal hadn’t changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  To find the beastmen’s base somewhere underground and steal the last key fragment.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to the sparrow, the three keys are called the Essence of the Sky, the Vessel of the Earth, and the Chalice of the Sea, and they are divine items used by the emperor to seal the torn dimensions.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Only those who inherit the emperor’s blood can use the keys.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at Pria.
 </p>
 <p>
  She was eating the meat with a sullen expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Not all the news is bad.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if they borrowed interference power, they couldn’t stay out of their assigned floors for long.
 </p>
 <p>
  In other words, except for Perseine, the 40th-floor Floor Master, the other two would soon return to their original floors.
 </p>
 <p>
  Luckily, I didn’t have to worry about being ganged up on by three of them.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  After filling my stomach, I drank water by the campfire.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What should I do?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I figured out why Townia got twisted, but nothing had changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was still alone, I still had to complete the mission within the time limit, and the enemy’s strength was overwhelming.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked down.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sparrow was pecking at small pieces of meat.
 </p>

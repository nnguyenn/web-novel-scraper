 <p>
  Tuweh.
 </p>
 <p>
  I spat out the blood that had filled my mouth.
 </p>

 <p>
  No matter when I taste it, it always feels disgusting.
 </p>
 <p>
  After shaking off the blood from the halberd, the corpse of the knight, which had been cut in half, finally fell to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Ha ha ha, did you see that? The power of this body!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stop bragging and come back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The sparrow turned into a red lightning bolt and returned to my left arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  I lowered the spearhead of the halberd. The soldiers hesitated and stepped back.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What the hell is that guy…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  A knight muttered with a hardened expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took a deep breath. It felt like my lungs were burning from swallowing flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  I might not look like it, but my body was already damaged from the inside out.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I wish they would just run away like this…’
 </p>
 <p>
  They hesitated, but they didn’t retreat.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were facing me, using barricades and obstacles as cover.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Haa, how annoying.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Support troops were rushing in from behind.
 </p>
 <p>
  I spun the halberd around.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Move away.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t retreat! Hold on until reinforcements arrive!”

 </div>
 <p>
  Of course, they don’t listen.
 </p>
 <p>
  I aimed the halberd at the officer and then charged.
 </p>
 <p>
  Arrows rained down immediately, but I spun the halberd like a windmill to deflect them all and then sliced through the officer who had drawn his sword. I leapt over the 2-meter-high barricade in a single bound.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Die!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A soldier thrust a spear at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can’t afford this.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t have the luxury to deal with all of them.
 </p>
 <p>
  I drew on the power of Ascend, dodged the spear, and stepped on the soldier’s shoulder.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aaah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Stepping hard, it seemed I had broken his collarbone.

 <p>
  Before the soldier fell, I jumped again.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stop him! Don’t let him pass!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pipipiping!
 </p>
 <p>
  Arrowheads grazed my thigh.
 </p>
 <p>
  A shallow trickle of blood spattered.
 </p>
 <p>
  I dodged all the spears and swords the soldiers swung at me and ran toward the cave entrance.
 </p>
 <p>
  A black knight clad in iron armor blocked the cave entrance.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Not yet.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t die here.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!

 <p>
  I dodged the greatsword swinging at my head and kicked the knight’s back as I passed by.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then I quickly dashed into the cave.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Church Army Soldier Lv.25] X 523
 </p>
 <p>
  [Church Army Knight Lv.31] X 53
 </p>
 <p>
  [Black Knight Lv.38] X 13
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking back, the enemies were swarming like ants.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Pursue him!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Just before Ascend ended, I raised the halberd towards the cave ceiling.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Skill, ‘Soublade Fusion’ activated!]
 </p>
 <p>
  A hundred percent powered into the Soublade Fusion using my entire body.

 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  The sound was like dynamite exploding, and chunks of stone fell from the ceiling.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon after, the surroundings darkened.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ceiling had collapsed, blocking the entrance.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Haa.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I threw away the halberd that was now just a spear shaft.
 </p>
 <p>
  Collapsing, I leaned against the wall and closed my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★★★★)’ has left the Ascend state.]
 </p>
 <p>
  There wasn’t a part of me that didn’t hurt.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was nearly in a critical state.

 <p>
  It was hard to move my body.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took out a potion from the pouch behind my belt.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pop. After several slips, I managed to open the potion.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gulp.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Already at your limit? The road ahead is long.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t be ridiculous.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I had only broken through the first stage, and he’s saying I’m at my limit.
 </p>
 <p>
  I drank the potion and looked around.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lamps were lit at various points in the cave passage.
 </p>
 <p>
  Somewhere in this place was the third key.

  And…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That woman must be waiting.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite causing such a commotion at the fortress, she didn’t appear, so something must be going on.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Anyway, this was self-inflicted suffering.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If I threw away everything like Eolka, Anytng, and Townia, and moved on, I could live comfortably.
 </p>
 <p>
  I don’t even know why I’m doing this.
 </p>
 <p>
  Why I’m taking the hard road, I can’t understand. If I had stayed when Yurnet asked me to remain in Niflheimr, I could have enjoyed all the luxury and lived comfortably.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Have I gone mad?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I was no longer normal.
 </p>
 <p>
  At some point, I knew.

 <p>
  Even if I returned to Earth, I would never be the same as before.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how delicious the food, casual chatting, or fun games, I wouldn’t be able to enjoy anything.
 </p>
 <p>
  Everything was gray.
 </p>
 <p>
  The only moments I felt joy,
 </p>
 <p>
  It was when I sent flying the opponent who was sneering at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I ripped off that guy’s head.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…Hah.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I’m a complete psychopath.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Can you fight?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course.”
 </p>
 <p>
  My body was slowly regaining some vitality.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I went through such hardships.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I even trained with Jenna holding a whip, to endure pain.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed the special training paid off. Even though I used Ascend to its limit, after a short rest, I recovered enough to move again. Physical training really is the best.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Grrk!”
 </p>
 <p>
  When I pulled out the arrow stuck in my back, blood flowed out.
 </p>
 <p>
  I poured the almost depleted healing potion on the wound.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is the Black Dragon Blood back?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;You can use it once more.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s enough.

 <p>
  I think I’m ready.
 </p>
 <p>
  I stood up, leaning on a protruding stone on the wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  The cave was a straight path, so there was no worry of getting lost.
 </p>
 <p>
  I caught my breath and moved inward.
 </p>
 <p>
  After walking for about 10 minutes, the scenery changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The cave widened, and a rotten smell like decaying meat filled the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked down.
 </p>
 <p>
  “….”
 </p>
 <p>
  Corpses were scattered all over.
 </p>
 <p>
  I knelt and examined one of them.

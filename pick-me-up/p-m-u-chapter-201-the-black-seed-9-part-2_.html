 <p>
  Corpses were scattered all over.
 </p>
 <p>
  I knelt and examined one of them.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is this a Joind tribe?’
 </p>
 <p>
  Where arms should have been, there were wings and claws.
 </p>
 <p>
  Harpy. I had seen these creatures a few times in the sections before the 10th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were dead in droves.
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering the situation so far, the culprit was obvious.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Did the monsters fight each other?’
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s not a rare case.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are missions where heroes and monsters from two factions engage in a three-way battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  I thought it was strange not to see the Joind tribe outside, but this explained it.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;How foolish.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “This works in my favor.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If they fight each other, I should welcome it with open arms.
 </p>
 <p>
  I found a usable sword among the Joind tribe’s corpses.
 </p>
 <p>
  It would be inconvenient to fight barehanded, so I decided to keep it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If only I had Bifrost…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Damn.

 <p>
  I shouldn’t have shown off at that event.
 </p>
 <p>
  I continued to follow the narrow cave path.
 </p>
 <p>
  After squeezing through a narrow gap, I found a wide open cavern. The walls of the cavern were filled with dozens of holes, and inside them were beds and household items. It seemed to be a village of the Joind tribe.
 </p>
 <p>
  The number of corpses here was many times greater than in the passage.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not only Joind corpses but also human soldiers’ corpses were mixed in.
 </p>
 <p>
  I searched the soldiers’ belongings and found a few throwing daggers.
 </p>
 <p>
  After taking a short break, I moved into a passage on the left side of the cavern.
 </p>
 <p>
  After walking for about 10 more minutes, a vibration and explosion echoed from afar.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Are they fighting?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I caught the timing just right.
 </p>

 <p>
  If I’m lucky, I might be able to reap the benefits.
 </p>
 <p>
  I slowed down my walking pace, slightly bending my body.
 </p>
 <p>
  The fresh smell of blood wafted in.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh… black… ugh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the cave wall, a male Joind tribe member was groaning with a stalactite piercing his chest.
 </p>
 <p>
  His entire left side was burnt and festering. It was evident he had been hit by a fire spell.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was the first living creature I encountered since entering this place. I approached him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You… you…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry. I came to kill that woman.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Joind tribe member groaned.

  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why are you fighting each other? Did they insult you for having a high-pitched voice?”
 </p>
 <p>
  This guy probably knows what’s going on.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was bleeding thick, black blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  This blood was a direct sign of being contaminated by Tel.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We… we…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I brought my ear to the Joind tribe member’s mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  But I didn’t hear the answer I wanted.
 </p>

 <p>
  &lt;He’s dead.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seems like it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The skewered Joind tribe member had his head drooped.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seems I need to go deeper into this cave to find out.
 </p>
 <p>
  I closed the Joind tribe member’s wide-open eyes and moved further into the cave.
 </p>
 <p>
  The violent explosion sounds were gradually decreasing.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  At the end of the passage, turning to the right, something awaited.
 </p>
 <p>
  I caught my breath lightly. I couldn’t say my body was in good condition. To be honest, it wasn’t great. I had activated Ascend for nearly 30 minutes and even used Soulbade Fusion at the end. If it were my former self, I would have died from the penalty long ago.

 <p>
  This mission is not normal.
 </p>
 <p>
  What should exist is gone, and what shouldn’t exist has appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Was it ever normal?
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter what comes out, I’ll just kill and eliminate it.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Be prepared.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  No need to say it.
 </p>
 <p>
  I drew the rusted sword from its sheath.
 </p>
 <p>
  And moved forward.

  ‘….’
 </p>
 <p>
  It looked like a shrine.
 </p>
 <p>
  Luxurious marble columns were set on both sides, and a rectangular altar could be seen inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  A small, glowing orb was floating above the altar.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That’s the key.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I dismissed the orb from my mind for now.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t important right now.

 <p>
  On the brick path leading to the altar stood a young woman wearing a pure white robe and a wooden crown.
 </p>
 <p>
  Two large pairs of wings spread from her sides.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our eyes met.
 </p>
 <p>
  The woman opened her mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We wanted to… turn back…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack!
 </p>
 <p>
  In the next moment, the woman shattered into pieces.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Amazing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A woman in a blood-stained blue robe emerged from behind a pillar.
 </p>
 <p>
  The robe, which should have been blue, was so soaked with blood that its original color was unrecognizable.
 </p>
 <p>
  “To think you broke through that fortress. I thought for sure you would die.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Danger!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Lord of Shutenberg]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Perseine Riedel von Stravern Lv.???]
 </p>
 <p>
  Perseine’s eyes curved into a crescent moon shape.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How did you get here? I exterminated all the Assinis. Did you summon some special reinforcements?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I just broke through.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…What?”
 </p>

 <p>
  Perseine blinked.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then suddenly burst into laughter.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hahahahaha! You broke through high walls and gates, thousands of soldiers, and hundreds of knights to get here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Does it sound like a lie?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, actually it crossed my mind, I thought maybe you could do it… I just didn’t think you would.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I glanced around the shrine once more.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were bloodstains and feathers scattered everywhere.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed the situation was already over.
 </p>
 <p>
  And… the sorceress in front of me was unscathed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anyway, since you’re here, it means you want to die.”

 <p>
  Perseine’s eyes shone blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her pupils throbbed with visible, powerful magic.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you had stayed put, you might have lived until the time limit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where are the other two?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why do you care?”
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed the sparrow’s words were right.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Beast King and the Saintess had returned to their original locations.
 </p>
 <p>
  The only one here was this crazy sorceress.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled and opened my mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Didn’t I tell you before? Think about what sound your head will make when it gets cut off.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Arrogant.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With no plan, just a reckless approach, I made it here.
 </p>
 <p>
  If I had tried to sneak in, I would have fallen into her trap. According to the sparrow, the whole fortress was covered with detection magic.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The situation isn’t good.’
 </p>
 <p>
  My physical condition was at its worst.
 </p>
 <p>
  By now, the blocked cave should have been broken through, and reinforcements would be coming.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the sorceress in front of me was extremely powerful.
 </p>
 <p>
  But I had to end it here.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter what happens.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So you…’
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked up.
 </p>
 <p>
  What I saw was the plain ceiling of the cave, but Anytng would be watching.
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t guess what he was thinking.
 </p>
 <p>
  Maybe he was considering quitting, wondering what kind of game this was.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Just cheer for me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I snapped my fingers.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, ‘Han (★★★★)’ requests your support!]
 </p>
 <p>
  For a moment, Anytng didn’t move the control panel.
 </p>
 <p>
  But eventually, he did.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Opening the Battle Shop.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have selected the High-Grade Cheering Glow Stick (One-time use, 100 gems). Would you like to purchase it?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes (Select) / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  Put your soul into waving it.
 </p>
 <p>
  That would give me strength too.
 </p>
 <p>
  I pointed my sword at Perseine.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now, let’s start the real fight.”

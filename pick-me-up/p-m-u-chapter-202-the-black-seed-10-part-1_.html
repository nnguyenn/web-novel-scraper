 <p>
  Flash!
 </p>
 <p>
  A glowing stick began to shake in front of my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the master’s support visible only to me, and I smiled as I prepared to dash out.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Looks like you’re pretty hurt. Can you still swing that sword of yours properly?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Perseine sneered at the corner of her mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Magic spheres were swirling near her robe.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You may not know this, but I am the pinnacle of all magicians in Townia.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  The magic spheres spun fiercely.
 </p>
 <p>
  If I were to even get grazed by one of those magic spheres, my flesh would be torn apart as if it had been put through a blender.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Pinnacle, huh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I calmed my breath.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Han! Remember my words.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The sparrow whispered in my mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  I know. I’ve heard this guy’s specs endlessly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The head of the magic family, called the Devil of Shutenberg, a title that has been passed down since ancient times.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;That woman has become several times stronger than she was in her previous life. She is continuously drawing upon her magical power.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Even after casting hundreds of spells, she doesn’t get tired.

 <p>
  Perseine had a nearly infinite reservoir of magical power.
 </p>
 <p>
  In contrast, I…
 </p>
 <p>
  Throb.
 </p>
 <p>
  The pounding in my heart grew stronger.
 </p>
 <p>
  My body was warning me. It was dangerous to keep moving.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What a joke.’
 </p>
 <p>
  All I needed to do was kill the woman in front of me.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was too late to say I couldn’t now.
 </p>
 <p>
  Don’t be ridiculous.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Die.”

 </div>
 <p>
  Perseine’s eyes dimmed.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the same time, the magic spheres scattered, leaving afterimages.
 </p>
 <p>
  I forced my unresponsive body to move.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  The ground I was standing on just a moment ago caved in.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Heh heh heh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Perseine’s body floated gently into the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fire, ice, wind, and lightning. The magic spheres containing the four elements scattered and shot towards me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I dodged the magic spheres, weaving between the pillars.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Smart, but if I destroy those pillars, it will be the end!”
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  Lightning bolts started to smash the pillars with intense light.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There’s no time.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If this dragged on, it would be my loss.
 </p>
 <p>
  While her magic power was infinite, my stamina was limited.
 </p>
 <p>
  My body was already in a wrecked state even before coming here. It seemed unlikely I could last even five more minutes.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Do not use the Soulblade Fusion. You will surely die.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  I know that too.
 </p>
 <p>
  If I use the Soulblade Fusion, I could kill the woman in front of me. But, with my already weakened body, I would not survive the backlash either.
 </p>
 <p>
  I came here to win, not to die.
 </p>

 <p>
  &lt;You have one chance!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  A hellish flame spread out in front of me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I climbed the broken pillar, stepped on the ceiling, and dodged far away. As soon as I came down, lightning chased me, and when I ducked, an ice spear brushed past my head.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A complete mass destruction weapon.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It felt like she could sweep through thousands alone on the battlefield.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How long will you keep running? You can’t kill me like that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you fighting with your mouth?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I pulled out a dagger from my belt and threw it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ting. The dagger blade made a pathetic sound as it bounced off Perseine’s barrier.
 </p>

 <p>
  As expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rushing in recklessly would have been a bloody mistake.
 </p>
 <p>
  I hid my body behind a split pillar.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom! Bang! Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed she intended to destroy the entire cave.
 </p>
 <p>
  Magic was pouring down from all directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;If the cave gets destroyed, you will die.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Either way, I die. So what should I do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Kill before you are killed!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t entirely hopeless.

 <p>
  There was a chance of victory for me.
 </p>
 <p>
  If I didn’t believe that, I wouldn’t have come.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘She doesn’t know.’
 </p>
 <p>
  What kind of power dwells in my left arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  What kind of technique I use, and how much explosive power I can generate.
 </p>
 <p>
  Exploiting that was the only path to victory.
 </p>
 <p>
  I rolled on the floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rock blades stabbed into the place where I had been.
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally, her magic reached this far.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come to think of it, you seemed pretty close with my disciple.”

 <p>
  Trying to provoke me was useless.
 </p>
 <p>
  My mind was endlessly calm.
 </p>
 <p>
  Countless possibilities and variables flashed through my mind like lightning.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s almost over.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I wouldn’t drag this out any longer.
 </p>
 <p>
  My left leg had already stopped responding.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘……’
 </p>
 <p>
  Beyond where Perseine stood, the glowing stick was rippling violently.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng was swinging the support stick with all his might.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Watch closely.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Just once.
 </p>
 <p>
  I twisted the sword handle.
 </p>
 <p>
  Cracks ran all along the blade, and magical bombardment was about to rain down from above.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Farewell, pathetic hero.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Perseine aimed her magic spheres at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Simultaneously, dozens of magic spheres attacked from left and right, from above and below.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Go.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  I flipped the switch in my mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★★★★)’ has entered Ascend mode!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Gulp.

 <p>
  At that moment, blood spurted out of my mouth and my vision went white.
 </p>
 <p>
  I bit my tongue hard enough to bleed. Only then did my vision return.
 </p>
 <p>
  A fireball was shooting towards me from right in front.
 </p>
 <p>
  I twisted my body to the right and stepped on the floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang! My body shot out like an arrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Perseine’s eyes narrowed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed. I could move this fast.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmph.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Perseine snorted and swung her hand.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  Crackle! A wall of lightning rose right in front of me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I reached out my left hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Unique Skill, ‘Black Dragon Scale’ activated!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [This hero is immune to magic!]
 </p>
 <p>
  As the lightning touched my left hand, the lightning wall vanished.
 </p>
 <p>
  I increased my speed even further.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Perseine’s expression twisted in frustration,
 </p>
 <p>
  but she quickly swung her hand again.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Quick judgment.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Light beams shot from the sides and behind.
 </p>
 <p>
  A place my left arm couldn’t reach. She instantly figured out the weakness of the Black Dragon Scale.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This much……’
 </p>
 <p>
  I twisted my body.
 </p>
 <p>
  The light arrows pierced through my forearm and thigh.
 </p>
 <p>
  If I couldn’t avoid them, I made sure they hit non-lethal spots.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★★★★)’ is in a critical condition. His life is in danger!]
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s okay.
 </p>
 <p>
  I reached this point before.
 </p>
 <p>
  I drew back my right arm holding the sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  To kill her in one strike.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even so, it’s no use.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Perseine twisted her lips.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then her lips moved silently.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I command you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Perseine pointed at me with her right hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s here.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The mysterious technique that killed Delphine, the strongest in the empire, and the leader of the Joind tribe, the White Feather, in one strike.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sparrow said it was an ancient power that had been lost long ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The Death Eye.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Just by seeing, just by pointing and speaking,
 </p>
 <p>
  it could instantly kill one designated target.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I first heard about it, I thought it was absurd, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  No, it really was a cheat skill.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Die.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Perseine’s pupils split sideways, revealing dragon eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Black Dragon Scale won’t stop it. It wasn’t really a magic spell.
 </p>
 <p>
  Therefore.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Repay the favor!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Screech!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A dark red lightning burst from my extended left arm, and the sparrow shot out.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’m not alone here.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sparrow flew and instantly scattered into blood clumps.
 </p>
 <p>
  Its body here was dead, but the pigeon in the waiting room would still be alive.
 </p>
 <p>
  I grinned.
 </p>
 <p>
  The hand covered in dragon scales touched the magical barrier.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This hero is immune to magic!]
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Goodbye.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack.
 </p>
 <p>
  The blade pierced her heart.
 </p>

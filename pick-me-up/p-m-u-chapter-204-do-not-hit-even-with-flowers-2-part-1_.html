  A holographic window popped up on Anytng’s screen.

 <p>
  [Tips/What is a Ruin?]

  [Ruins are special areas placed in each sector. In Ruins, you can obtain various rare materials and gems that cannot be acquired in the weekly dungeon. However, items can only be collected while you are occupying the Ruin, so if another Master is occupying it, you must take it from them,
  <br/>
  so if you are the one occupying it, you must defend it solidly, right?]
 </p>
 <p>
  In fact, there were Ruins near the 30th floor where the Dimensional Rift opened.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, since the 30th floor area focused on small-scale battles, resources were not needed much, so they were left alone.
 </p>
 <p>
  But now the situation has changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was a limit to increasing power through self-sufficiency.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if it meant fighting against other users sitting in the Ruins, resources had to be collected.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘You know exactly what to do.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng was looking into the Ruins.
 </p>
 <p>
  Avoid unnecessary fights,
 </p>
 <p>
  but do not shy away from necessary ones.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was one of the ironclad rules to becoming a top-tier Master.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng immediately opened the airship menu and began refueling.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, she pressed the ‘Sector’ button in the Dimensional Rift tab.
 </p>
 <p>
  A wide map in the form of a grid appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  The blue tower icon in the center was the location of the current waiting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were two red tower icons not far away.
 </p>
 <p>
  These were the coordinates of other accounts.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, an ‘X’ was marked in the center of the red towers.

  Inactive accounts.
 </p>
 <p>
  In other words, accounts that had been abandoned.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘You’ve got everything ready.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Most of the map was covered in fog, but at the northeast end of the current location, a crystal tower icon was placed.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a Ruin.
 </p>
 <p>
  After capturing Capitalism, he had already instructed the mechanic.
 </p>
 <p>
  To find Ruins in the sector when there was time.
 </p>
 <p>
  It would eventually be used.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, starting the dispatch!]
 </p>

 </p>
 <p>
  Next, the dispatch window popped up on the screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Selecting an airship and party to leave this place would send the designated members to the specified coordinates.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Select all!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Will you dispatch ‘1 Party’?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  No.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked up at the sky.

  There was no need to take the entire 1 Party.
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio was an indispensable talent for airship construction, and Kishasha was enthusiastically helping the newcomers at the training center.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Three will be enough.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In a war to obtain resources, I did not intend to consume manpower.
 </p>
 <p>
  After pondering my suggestion for a moment, Anytng eventually limited the dispatch personnel to three.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you saying we are going with just three people?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Too many would just be cumbersome.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I like that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m not so sure. Couldn’t the opponent pressure us with numbers?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We have to aim for an advantage. We can’t afford to waste combat troops in such a fight. Once things are somewhat settled, we’ll call in others.”

  From the 40th floor, the novice restriction was lifted, and in PVP, if a hero died, it was the end.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘We can do it.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In the Ruins, usually two to three forces are at odds.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you properly insert yourself between them and instigate, you can be effective even with a small number. And at the critical moment, bring in the main force to suppress them.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had used this method to occupy Ruins in Niflheimr without suffering significant losses.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, for the vanguard, you needed top-tier members who wouldn’t get hurt in an ordinary fight.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s why I called Jenna and Velkist.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Starting dispatch!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Reservation has been applied.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng had set up a reserved dispatch.

  He must know that it’s the heroes’ sleep time now.
 </p>
 <p>
  The coordinates were the medium-sized Ruin in the northeastern sector.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Ruin occupation would begin tomorrow afternoon, based on the waiting room’s time.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Tomorrow, the three of us will head out to the Ruin first. Bring potions and weapons.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist left the training room with a cold smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  He seemed quite excited.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, I don’t like fighting against others, but… given the situation, it can’t be helped. I’m in your care tomorrow, Oppa.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna greeted me and headed to the dormitory.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘An occupation battle, huh.’

  It’s been a while.
 </p>
 <p>
  After Niflheimr settled, there were no more troublemakers.
 </p>
 <p>
  The basic strategy was for us to go out as the vanguard, clear the enemies, and then bring in the main force, but if possible, I wanted to end the situation with just the three of us. It was more efficient that way.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, will you log out?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes (selected) / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Goodbye then!]
 </p>
 <p>
  After finishing her work, Anytng logged out of the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was late at night. I needed to prepare for tomorrow as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  There would be fierce days ahead for a while.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not that it was ever different.

 <p>
  The guild life of Anytng had begun.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since only the master of the same sector could join the Silver Star Guild, Anytng was a temporary member. However, Saecheorom, the guild leader, did not particularly discriminate against him, giving him item distribution rights and assigning him the rank of a full guild member.

 <p>
  After all, the Silver Star Guild claimed that all members were equal, whether they were the guild leader or temporary members.
 </p>
 <p>
  At least, on the surface.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems our turn will never come around.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In the temporary quarters on the second floor of the villa.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist was skimming through the ledger.
 </p>
 <p>
  “As far as I know, two people received resources yesterday. Yet, our turn is still last.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, they were given priority due to urgent circumstances. There’s nothing we can do about it, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do they think they are the only ones with urgent circumstances?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s true, but…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist and Jenna both looked at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Their expressions were asking what to do.
 </p>
 <p>
  Receiving distribution rights was good.
 </p>
 <p>
  But even after three days, our turn was still the last.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s because of those so-called vigilantes.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Besides the woman from the other day, several vigilantes had taken others’ turn.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to Adilang, they were heroes who had made significant contributions in capturing this ruin from PvP players and were practically the muscle of the Silver Star Guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, it made sense.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how remote it is, there will always be PvP players approaching the ruins.

 <p>
  Jenna reported that during her reconnaissance around the ruin island, she spotted a pirate fleet lurking from afar.
 </p>
 <p>
  They would attack the moment they saw any weakness. The woman’s words from yesterday, saying that if Silver Star Vigilantes weakened, enemies would invade, were not unfounded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “An ideal paradise where everyone is equal and peaceful?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist sneered.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was what Adilang had told us when introducing the Silver Star Guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The talk of a person who knows nothing about the world. I can’t understand how they reached the 40th floor. Maybe they only faced easy missions.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist half-drew his sword from its sheath.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then he looked at me with cold eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s overturn it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”

  “You should know better. This place is a mess. It’s full of hypocrites. The strong take everything. It has always been that way. How long do we have to play this child’s game? Isn’t that right, Archer?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, I…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna scratched her cheek.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t the Master’s opinion more important than deciding among ourselves?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, right. That annoying fellow. But isn’t he just your puppet anyway?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re the puppet. Watch your words.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “My apologies.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist crossed his legs.
 </p>
 <p>
  The reason I couldn’t make a decision.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was because of Anytng.
 </p>

 <p>
  Ultimately, the master overseeing Townia was Anytng.
 </p>
 <p>
  How Anytng handled this incident would determine our future path.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, even if I overturned this place, Anytng would not blame me.
 </p>
 <p>
  At most, he would consult Loki’s email address.
 </p>
 <p>
  I could just answer as Loki and cover it up appropriately.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Puppet.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t entirely wrong.
 </p>
 <p>
  Most of the waiting room had flowed in the direction I wanted so far.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If I were the master…’
 </p>
 <p>
  I would never get involved with a guild like this.

 <p>
  In some ways, it’s more troublesome than PVP guilds.
 </p>
 <p>
  They choke you with pens instead of swords.
 </p>
 <p>
  During my time as a master, I was marked for months on a major community site as a prime example of an ill-mannered user.
 </p>
 <p>
  Until the misunderstanding was cleared, I had to fight countless users.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are always such idiot people.
 </p>
 <p>
  If they were PvP-oriented users, I could fight to my heart’s content, but dealing with these guys is quite tricky.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unless they are masters with no future.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng was a promising figure with a bright future.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What would you do if you were the master?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I would endure it for now.”
 </p>

  “Endure? That’s not like you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Could you fight two fronts?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Capturing the ruins doesn’t end it.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you’re marked as an ill-mannered master, many masters would simply invade your main base.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the 50th-floor strategy ahead, it would be burdensome.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But if they keep acting like this… would you still endure?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I picked up the statue on the table.
 </p>
 <p>
  A size that fits perfectly in one hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  A finely crafted body.
 </p>
 <p>
  Holding up two muscular legs.

 <p>
  It was the ‘Brave Warhorse Statue’ that Anytng had gifted me as a 45th-floor clear reward.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was glad he gifted me this statue.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just touching it brings peace of mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I said, rolling the statue in my hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked down at the sword sheath below my belt.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t Bifrost, but it was a well-made longsword crafted with great care at the item workshop.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, for now…’
 </p>
 <p>
  I should observe how things go here.

 <p>
  I covered his mouth as he tried to scream.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…?!”

 <p>
  “Do you really want to overthrow this place?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I laughed as I twisted the blade.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sound of bones and flesh tearing filled the room.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mm! Mmm… Uuugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I kicked away the man’s hand as he tried to draw his dagger.
 </p>
 <p>
  Snap. With the sound of a bone breaking, his wrist bent in the opposite direction.
 </p>
 <p>
  “iUrrrgh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll give you what you want.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In the blue meadow outside the window.
 </p>
 <p>
  The girls were handing a flower crown to Sijal as she walked by.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Miss Vigilante! It’s a gift for you. We heard you work hard.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s fine, really…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you not need it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, I’ll take it! You made it beautifully…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Crash!
 </p>
 <p>
  A suspicious object fell in front of them.
 </p>
 <p>
  No, rather than falling, it flew.
 </p>
 <p>
  Four limbs were bent like broken chopsticks, and the whole body was covered in red.

 <p>
  At a glance, it resembled a pillbug.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the corpse of the man I had thrown out the window.
 </p>
 <p>
  I jumped down to the first floor, shaking off the blood on my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  One side of the flower garden was stained red.
 </p>
 <p>
  The girls, who finally realized it was a corpse, turned pale.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sijal turned around and shouted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You girls, go to the shelter! Darhin! Go with them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The two girls hurriedly left with the young man guiding them.

 <p>
  Sijal’s eyes narrowed as she looked down at the body.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What did you do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Didin’t you say you’d overthrow this place, and now you pretend to be good?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Han, what is the meaning of this!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The door to the first floor of the villa opened, and another guest appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Adilung Rizos. He was the sub-master of the Silver Star Guild, under Seochorom.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took a deep breath.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sijal and her vigilante members. Adilung Rizos and his subordinates.
 </p>
 <p>
  All the heroes in the meadow were looking at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  There must have been at least a hundred of them.

  “Han, fighting among family members is strictly prohibited! No matter the reason…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Cut the crap.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll say it once, so listen carefully.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I loosened my grip on my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  And I spoke to the people staring at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Leave everything behind and get out of here. If I see you again, I’ll kill you all.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do I need to make it simpler?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I grinned.

 <p>
  “We’re taking over this place.”
 </p>
 <p>
  For a moment, the atmosphere froze.
 </p>
 <p>
  Both Sijal and Adilung had blank expressions.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Sorry about this.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t the right time yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna was gathering information about the enemy.
 </p>
 <p>
  But you have to be able to tolerate a madman rampaging.
 </p>
 <p>
  He touched something he shouldn’t have.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Does that mean…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you declaring war?”
 </p>

 <p>
  Adilung asked.
 </p>
 <p>
  I nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ding!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have left the ‘Silver Star’ guild.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng immediately entered the tactical menu.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then he touched the icon of a red sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, do you want to issue an attack command on the medium-sized ruin (847D)?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You crazy bastard! Who do you think you are?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A guy with a spear rushed towards me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, his body was sliced into two along with the spear shaft.
 </p>

 <p>
  When I kicked his upper body, blood and flesh splattered, painting the flower field red.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Everyone, prepare for battle!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The vigilante members simultaneously drew their weapons.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sijal glanced at Adilung.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Adilung!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Adilung, with a hardened face, pulled out a small staff and drew a circle.
 </p>
 <p>
  A blue dimensional gate appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Non-combatants, please evacuate through the rift! This passage leads to the shelter!”
 </p>
 <p>
  People without weapons started to hurriedly enter the dimensional gate.
 </p>
 <p>
  They really work well together.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Whether you’re the mad dog or whatever, you won’t return alive.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sijal growled, baring her teeth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems I misjudged you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Adilung stood next to Sijal.
 </p>
 <p>
  Adilung was a born 4-star mage and was the leader during the Liberation War.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘They work very well together.’
 </p>
 <p>
  An external enemy unites internal factions, huh?
 </p>
 <p>
  Very nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  It means I can kill them all at once.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dozens of vigilante members surrounded me from a distance.
 </p>
 <p>
  A perfect encirclement.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  There was a scream from the left, and a blood-soaked body flew through the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  You arrived early.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seems they smelled the blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Man. Why drag this out when this was inevitable?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist, who had broken through the encirclement, stood beside me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Blood dripped from his sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yaaah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna, who had jumped several meters into the air, landed beside us.

  “I suspected as much, but I’m glad I came right away.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is your investigation done?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Roughly. There’s a vigilante stronghold blocking the path to the crystal. Inside the stronghold, there’s an object, and if we hold out there, it seems we win by capture.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Good.
 </p>
 <p>
  The investigation is complete.
 </p>
 <p>
  What’s left is…
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  Two people who used to be hostile to each other stood shoulder to shoulder.
 </p>
 <p>
  They must have looked like this when they fought together in the past.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Unfortunately.’

 <p>
  Today’s battle will be long.
 </p>
 <p>
  It won’t just be long.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is just the beginning.
 </p>
 <p>
  Above the horizon, small dots were approaching.
 </p>
 <p>
  Those bandits who had been biding their time. They noticed it too.
 </p>
 <p>
  A triangular formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the right was me,
 </p>
 <p>
  On the left was Velkist,
 </p>
 <p>
  And below was Jenna.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You won’t hold back, will you, archer?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who do you think I am? I do what needs to be done.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna’s hand reached for her short bow.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Watch closely, Vel-Oppa. I’ll show you how those who stand in our way will be given the taste of my arrows.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmph.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I spun my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  As of today, the Silver Star Guild is disbanded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether we win or lose, that can’t be helped.
 </p>
 <p>
  Peace for everyone?
 </p>
 <p>
  Shove that nonsense up your ass.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this world, the strong win,
 </p>
 <p>
  And the winners take everything.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ll make you realize how pitiful your dream is.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, do you want to issue an attack command on the medium-sized ruin (847D)?]
 </p>
 <p>
  The system window popped up in my view again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng was looking at the ruin field.
 </p>
 <p>
  The circular formation of us, surrounded by the vigilante members.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes (Select) / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng touched ‘Yes’.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Warning!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The capture battle is starting!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Your relationship with the ‘Silver Star Guild’ has turned hostile!]
 </p>
 <p>
  My vision turned red.
 </p>
 <p>
  The attack signal had been given.
 </p>

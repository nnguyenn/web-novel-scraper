 <p>
  Jenna crouched low, pulling her bowstring to the limit.
 </p>
 <p>
  A large steel arrow was nocked.
 </p>

 <p>
  Jenna’s eyes glowed red.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Unique skill, ‘Steel Storm’ activated!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Wind wrapped around the arrowhead, and the arrow shot out with terrifying speed.
 </p>
 <p>
  A light shockwave brushed my face.
 </p>
 <p>
  The 70 cm long steel arrow traced an arc.
 </p>
 <p>
  Splat!
 </p>
 <p>
  Several cavalrymen at the forefront were cut down along with their horses.
 </p>
 <p>
  The remains of the horse and human bodies soared meters into the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Done. Let’s go!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna slung her bow over her shoulder.
 </p>
 <p>
  The cavalry, their formation broken, fell like bundles of straw.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘To work with me, you have to be at least this good.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I smirked and moved toward the fortress.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna’s precise sniping had surpassed the level of ballistae, akin to cannon fire.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Take them out first!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I heard shouts from the fortress walls.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seems the arrow we just fired had attracted their attention.

 <p>
  Archers, ballistae, and cannons aimed our way.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thump!
 </p>
 <p>
  A large arrow shot from a ballista.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmph.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist swung his sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ballista arrow split perfectly in half and flew to either side.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, a cannon about to fire exploded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna had lodged an arrow into the barrel just before it fired.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Go first.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist dodged the rain of arrows like a ghost and stuck to the fortress wall.

 <p>
  Then he leaped vertically up the wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon, bodies began to rain down from the wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll go too!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna alternately pushed off the wall and the air, jumping up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked up.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Lucette had followed us and was floating above.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Hey… are you the same humans as us? Did you take some weird drug or develop superpowers?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  This brat, so noisy.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Should I stay here?&gt;

 <p>
  “No, take the targeting position.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Uh, it looks like you’re doing fine on your own…&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  I moved to the side.
 </p>
 <p>
  A pile of soldier corpses fell where I had been standing.
 </p>
 <p>
  The fortress’s defensive forces ignored the Lucette.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because just two people were wreaking havoc inside the fortress.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shoot the gate. I need to get in.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Ahem.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  There was a cough.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Didn’t these two just jump over? Can’t you follow up…?&gt;
 </p>

 <p>
  &lt;Really?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s your name?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Lucette’s cannon fired, making a small hole in the gate.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Ahahaha, I’ll cover you!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The Lucette ascended.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Really funny.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I grabbed the small hole with my hand and widened it.
 </p>
 <p>
  The reinforced wooden planks spread apart, creating a gap.

 <p>
  I moved through it. Inside, numerous troops were moving about.
 </p>
 <p>
  Reinforcements were pouring out of the buildings inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  Adilung’s doing, no doubt.
 </p>
 <p>
  They seemed to be supplying personnel through dimensional gates.
 </p>
 <p>
  These guys’ estimated levels were between 10 and 20.
 </p>
 <p>
  They hadn’t received proper training.
 </p>
 <p>
  They’re just numbers.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Still, there must be around a thousand.’
 </p>
 <p>
  They’re buying time until the vigilantes arrive.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stop them! By any means necessary!”

 <p>
  A young man in vigilante attire shouted from a second-floor watchtower.
 </p>
 <p>
  I soared up in an instant, kicking the walls, buildings, and watchtower railings next to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Gasp!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Crack.
 </p>
 <p>
  Grabbing his neck, he died instantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  I stood in the watchtower and looked around.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna and Velkist were sweeping away the troops on the walls like a broom.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;You hypocrites! Got you now!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Through the gap in the gate, I saw the harbor.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was in flames with smoke rising.
 </p>

 <p>
  Dozens of armed heroes descended from airships with red flags.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Equality? Peace? Screw that!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Haha! That’s music to my ears!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked behind the fortress, at the steep cliff.
 </p>
 <p>
  Airships were stationed at the top, and heroes with swords and spears were descending towards the fortress.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, they weren’t Silver Star.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It wasn’t just one.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Bang! Boom boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  The sound of distant cannon fire tickled my ears.
 </p>
 <p>
  A fleet battle seemed to be underway somewhere.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There must be about ten hunters.’
 </p>
 <p>
  They seemed to have set their sights on us.
 </p>
 <p>
  Airships carrying raiders were landing all over the ruins, ready to fill the entire field.
 </p>
 <p>
  They killed anyone who met their eyes and approached the crystal.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is how it should be.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ruins are supposed to be like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  They hadn’t quit but were waiting for the right moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s not one-on-one-on-one…’
 </p>
 <p>
  How many against how many?
 </p>
 <p>
  I don’t know.

  Ping!
 </p>
 <p>
  I tilted my head.
 </p>
 <p>
  An arrow grazed my cheek.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  A sniper descending the cliff outside the fortress had shot at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you receive a gift, you should return it.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took a wind-up stance and threw my dagger.
 </p>
 <p>
  The dagger embedded itself in the forehead of the archer 100 meters away.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Of course…’
 </p>
 <p>
  We will win.

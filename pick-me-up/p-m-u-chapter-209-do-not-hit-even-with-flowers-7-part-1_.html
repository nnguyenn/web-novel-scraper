 <p>
  The fortress built to guard against enemy invasions had long since lost its function.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, it was merely a battlefield where dozens of Masters and hundreds of heroes were fighting.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Now, this is more like it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist swung his sword at an enemy jumping from the fortress wall stairs.
 </p>
 <p>
  At his feet, corpses piled up, whose owners were unknown, and his leather armor was already stained red with blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ping! Ping ping ping!
 </p>
 <p>
  Arrows flew from Jenna’s short bow.
 </p>
 <p>
  The arrows struck four bandits climbing the fortress wall using ladders.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kahahaha! Kill them! Kill them!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Get inside the fortress! We can’t let them take the goddess statue!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You think that’s possible?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the fortress, where it was hard to distinguish between allies and enemies, heroes swung their weapons at each other.
 </p>
 <p>
  They didn’t care whether they hit an enemy or an ally.
 </p>
 <p>
  Every building in the fortress was engulfed in hot smoke and flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sounds of weapons clashing, desperate screams, explosions, and the sound of flesh being torn apart, mingled with manic laughter, echoed like an orchestra throughout the ruins.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How many of them are there?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna whistled.
 </p>
 <p>
  She didn’t stop shooting her short bow.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I swung my sword without looking back.

 <p>
  Blood gushed from the diagonally severed torsos of two men.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There are quite a lot.’
 </p>
 <p>
  We stood on one side of the fortress wall, observing the situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just fighting recklessly wasn’t the answer.
 </p>
 <p>
  To enjoy a delicious meal, you need to let it simmer.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a siege, killing many didn’t yield much benefit.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether you killed a hundred or one, the side that captured the central objective of the fortress would be victorious.
 </p>
 <p>
  If one side successfully occupied it, the other forces wouldn’t be able to enter the ruins for a certain period.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The vigilantes must be there.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If there were magicians, they could quickly move through the dimensional gate.

 <p>
  They would be forming the final defensive line in front of the objective to block the enemies.
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  An airship spewed fire and crashed into the fortress.
 </p>
 <p>
  When the bow hit the fortress wall, the debris flew in all directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crash.
 </p>
 <p>
  A few heroes fighting nearby turned into minced meat.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Argh!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked up.
 </p>
 <p>
  An aerial battle was unfolding in the sky as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  Three airships with different emblems were chasing the Lucette.

 <p>
  Bang! Bang! Bang bang bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  Scarlet artillery fire bloomed in the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Lucette dodged left and right, avoiding the bombardment.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Take good care of it. If you blow up our new toy, there won’t be any soup or rice.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Help me!&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  We’re down here, and you’re up there, how can we help?
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Handle it yourself.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Once we capture the ruins, we can mass-produce those airships.
 </p>
 <p>
  We can just make new ones.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You mad dog…!”

 <p>
  I stabbed a flustered man in the gut.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mad Dog. Whoever gave me that nickname,
 </p>
 <p>
  If I ever meet them, I’ll grind them up nicely.
 </p>
 <p>
  I squinted my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Heroes from each faction were fighting frantically on the fortress walls, roads, and alleys, but the key forces weren’t here. They had gone inside where the objective was.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s about time we went in too.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t plan to drag this out.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at Jenna and Velkist alternately.
 </p>
 <p>
  The two nodded silently as if they had sensed my thoughts.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s go.”

  Without hesitation, I jumped off the 8-meter-high fortress wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud. I landed on the roof of a building inside the fortress and jumped to the next building 2 meters away.
 </p>
 <p>
  The two quickly followed behind.
 </p>
 <p>
  Slash.
 </p>
 <p>
  As I cut down an assassin on the roof, my vision blurred.

 <p>
  It’s rare to see such a large-scale battle in the 40th floors.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Move away.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I moved the broadcast window to the right.
 </p>
 <p>
  The viewers were chattering about something, but I decided to ignore them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Let them watch if they want.
 </p>
 <p>
  My skills were already revealed in the event match anyway.
 </p>
 <p>
  From roof to roof.
 </p>
 <p>
  From wall to wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  We cleared away any annoying enemies and moved toward the inner fortress.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘As expected.’

 <p>
  Here, it’s a bit more distinguishable.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the middle of the inner fortress, a crystal symbolizing the ruin rose like a skyscraper,
 </p>
 <p>
  And around the crystal, the Silver Star vigilantes had set up barricades.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kya ha ha! Kill them!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kill those herbivores!”
 </p>
 <p>
  And raiders swarmed the barricades like ants.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There it is.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I noticed a narrow staircase leading underground in front of the crystal.
 </p>
 <p>
  If we go in there, there will be a goddess statue overseeing the entire ruin.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What should we do? Should we sneak in?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I shook my head.
 </p>
 <p>
  The entire barricade was surrounded by a transparent barrier.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the magical barrier of a mage.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That’s why mages are a nuisance.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Sneaking in is the most efficient.
 </p>
 <p>
  The underground path of the ruin is very narrow, so three people could block it sufficiently.
 </p>
 <p>
  The original plan was to deal with Adilung and then proceed, but some crazy guy got on my nerves, messing things up.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘If they know we’re here, they’ll give us a warm welcome.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Because we’re the ones who caused this chaos.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Block them at all costs! Contact the other Masters! Call in everyone, whether they’re here or not!”

 <p>
  In front of the barricade, Sijal shouted as she cut down the enemies.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, whether the message got through or not, reinforcements for the Silver Star kept coming to the barricade.
 </p>
 <p>
  Cannons inside the defensive line fired continuously, checking the airships in the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were 24 Masters from the same sector.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was not a small number.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems there’s no choice but to break through the front.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist raised his sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had cut down so many that the blade was completely dull.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll take the lead.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait.”

 <p>
  If we join the fray, there’s a risk of being attacked by both the Silver Star and the bandits.
 </p>
 <p>
  If they know anything about me, they won’t hesitate to team up.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked back.
 </p>
 <p>
  Masters from neighboring sectors seemed to have caught the scent too.
 </p>
 <p>
  Another fleet of airships was gathering.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘We need to finish this quickly.’
 </p>
 <p>
  We could call for reinforcements from the waiting room, but it would be a waste to use them here.
 </p>
 <p>
  I thought for a moment and then looked at the two.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So we’re breaking through the front?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. But I’ll go alone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll draw attention over there, and you two sneak into the underground entrance. Block the front and take control of the place.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……Can you do it alone?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What choice do we have? We have to try.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oppa you will cause a commotion, and we’ll sneak in, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna smiled brightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  I nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then I’ll leave it to you. Vel oppa, let’s go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…….”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist looked slightly displeased but soon hardened his face and followed Jenna.
 </p>
 <p>
  After confirming that the two had disappeared, I jumped off the wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The strategy is becoming similar each time.’
 </p>
 <p>
  This time too, it’s causing a ruckus.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, this is the most efficient way, so it can’t be helped.
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled as I spun my sword and slowly approached the barricade.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Halkion Syraos.”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Here I am.&gt;

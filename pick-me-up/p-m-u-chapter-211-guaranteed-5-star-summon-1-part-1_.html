 <p>
  As a result, our stay at the ruins lasted just over a week.
 </p>
 <p>
  We didn’t want to gather resources up to the second occupation battle.
 </p>

 <p>
  Anyway, once we moved up to the 50th floor, it was a place we would never return to, and as long as we uses the resources properly in the first week, we could meet our target.
 </p>
 <p>
  A few days later.
 </p>
 <p>
  While we were in the midst of strengthening our forces for the 50th-floor attack.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh…! Ugh, ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the man kneeling in front of the desk in my office.
 </p>
 <p>
  The man, whose left eye was swollen blue and covered in blood scabs, was tightly bound all over his body.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you want, causing trouble?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps because of the gag in his mouth, the man just squirmed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yesterday at dawn, Velkist said he heard suspicious noises during training.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sound was of another master’s airship landing in the dimensional rift.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist, who went to the rift first, quietly drew his sword after discovering the enemy group preparing an ambush.
 </p>
 <p>
  And this was the result.
 </p>
 <p>
  Out of 13 enemies, 12 were killed.
 </p>
 <p>
  One prisoner was captured.
 </p>
 <p>
  I approached the guy and removed his gag.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You damned bastard! I’ll make sure you pay for the atrocities you committed at the ruins…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Smack!

 <p>
  I kicked the guy’s mouth with my boot.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The man spewed blood and collapsed.
 </p>
 <p>
  I expected this. An ignorant master saw the reports about Anytng on the official café and attacked after getting riled up.
 </p>
 <p>
  A single small airship and 13 lousy heroes.
 </p>
 <p>
  How pathetic.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But still…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Since it was deep in the early morning, if Velkist hadn’t discovered them first, the non-combat personnel might have suffered significant damage.
 </p>
 <p>
  Things are becoming more bothersome.
 </p>
 <p>
  If these guys appear sporadically, we won’t be able to focus solely on the attack.

 <p>
  If we send all the combatants on a large-scale mission, we might find the waiting room in chaos when we return.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had no interest in seeing such a pathetic scene.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What a nuisance.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I clicked my tongue.
 </p>
 <p>
  We needed to leave some troops in reserve.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each person was crucial at this time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, equipping the dimensional rift with defensive facilities and creating a dedicated defense unit would improve defense efficiency.
 </p>
 <p>
  It would be like an external defense force.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What should we do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What else? Feed him to an appropriate guy.”

 <p>
  This guy was useless.
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa dragged the struggling man by the nape and left the office.
 </p>
 <p>
  I roughly mopped up the blood splattered on the floor and sat down on the chair.
 </p>
 <p>
  Reports from Neryssa were piled up like mountains on the office desk. They detailed how many combatants had increased, what equipment had been made, and the progress of the airship construction.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can manage somehow.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Except for the itch on the back of my head, things were going smoothly.
 </p>
 <p>
  After sipping the green tea on the desk, I skimmed the last report with my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a plan written by Anytng yesterday.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;5-Star Training Plan&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  – Leave it to Han.
 </p>

 <p>
  I sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  What kind of crappy plan is this?
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s just passing the buck.
 </p>
 <p>
  I understand, though.
 </p>
 <p>
  5-star heroes were significantly different from 1-4-star heroes.
 </p>
 <p>
  If other grades were elementary students, 5-stars were college students.
 </p>
 <p>
  If they received the same education at the training center, it might not be suitable for their level. Therefore, He wanted me, the senior in the waiting room, to mark them personally.
 </p>
 <p>
  I read the training plan roughly and signed the signature line below.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Anytng logged in today, it would show that I had agreed to the proposal.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So it’s today, huh.’

  I finished my green tea.
 </p>
 <p>
  I decided to see what would come out.

  [Loading is complete.]

 <p>
  [T O U C H! (Select)]
 </p>
 <p>
  That evening.
 </p>
 <p>
  As usual, Anytng logged in.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  I sat on a bench in the first-floor plaza.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was waiting to see what would come out of the summoning center.

 <p>
  ‘A guaranteed 5-star summon ticket.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was something I obtained through hard work at the Raid Festa.
 </p>
 <p>
  The system said it would unconditionally give a born 5-star hero,
 </p>
 <p>
  But this was a bit different from what I learned about 5-star heroes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Born 5-stars might not be obtainable even if you spend billions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Starting with myself, several users who threw the equivalent of a foreign car and a house price failed to get a 5-star.
 </p>
 <p>
  After falling into this world and becoming a hero, I realized that 5-stars might not exist depending on the circumstances of the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  Niflheimr was such a case.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But they said it’s 100% 5-star.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I rubbed my chin.

 <p>
  It was suspicious.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng started rummaging through the warehouse.
 </p>
 <p>
  It didn’t take long before I saw the item.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Guaranteed 5-Star Summon Ticket]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Grade: SS]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Guaranteed to obtain a born 5-star hero.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Note – Congratulations on winning the overall victory in the 3rd Dimension City Event!]
 </p>
 <p>
  A ticket shimmering in rainbow light.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng touched the ticket.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do you want to proceed with the guaranteed summon?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  “They say born 5-stars are strong?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna, sitting next to me, swung her legs.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I told her the master was going to use the 5-star ticket, she tagged along to watch.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Will it be stronger than you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Probably not.”
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how strong a 5-star is, it starts at level 1.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the starting point and talents would be different.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, I understand.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If it was a key figure in the world, it would have some unique skills hidden.

 </p>
 <p>
  [Boom!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Iselle: No, this feeling?!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Light started pouring out from the open door of the summoning center.
 </p>
 <p>
  The white flashing light gradually turned golden.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Quaaang!]

 <p>
  [Iselle: Wow! It’s dazzling!]
 </p>
 <p>
  I don’t know how many times I spun gacha to hear those cringe-worthy lines.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The hero among heroes!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Meet the hero who left a mark in history!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [「Hyper Rare!」]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master ‘Anytng’ has acquired the hero ‘Wiryung (★★★★★)’!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Amid the flashy sound effects, small footsteps were heard.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the summoning center.
 </p>
 <p>
  Someone was walking out of the light.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Welcome to the waiting room!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna ran up to the 5-star.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m Jenna Shirai! From Townia… huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna furrowed her brows.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her dark eyes blinked endlessly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You look… bizarre.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna smiled awkwardly.

 <p>
  The place for the newly summoned 5-star hero, Wiryung, was decided to be the fourth floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, given her superior basic specs, it wouldn’t make sense to treat her the same as the other new recruits.

 <p>
  Her accommodations were also assigned next to mine. It seemed that Anytng, who specially designated the arrangement, wanted me to take extra care of her. Even Neryssa seemed to have received some orders, as the schedule of the sub-master suddenly became empty.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang.
 </p>
 <p>
  I threw the practice iron sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sword clattered loudly as it hit the iron floor of the fourth-floor training room.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Not coming.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I had confirmed that she was in her room in the morning.
 </p>
 <p>
  had also mentioned that there were some basics she needed to know and told her to come to the training room.
 </p>
 <p>
  But several hours had passed, and that door hadn’t opened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is she playing hard to get because she’s so valuable?” Velkist sneered coldly.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had called him to accurately gauge Wiryung’s strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shall I go get her? I can drag her out by her hair.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Leave it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist, who was about to leave the training room, stopped.
 </p>
 <p>
  He looked at me blankly and sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do as you wish.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist entered the private training room in the corner of the training hall.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sat on the rest couch with my arms crossed. It had been half a day since Anytng summoned Wiryung to the training room.
 </p>
 <p>
  I still didn’t hear even the sound of footsteps.

 <p>
  ‘They said she was in a state of despondency.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Despondency.
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the status effects that heroes suffer when their stress levels reach their limit.
 </p>
 <p>
  A hero in a state of despondency cannot be dispatched on missions, and all abilities, including skills and engravings, are significantly reduced in battle. It’s practically a groggy state.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yesterday, Anytng, who had just summoned the 5-star Wiryung, wanted to send her on a test mission but couldn’t.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng tapped Wiryung in the Hero Box dozens of times and searched through the help menu but couldn’t find a proper solution. He just placed Wiryung in the waiting room and logged off.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was understandable to be flabbergasted.
 </p>
 <p>
  They had drawn a 5-star hero, which was supposed to be so powerful.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, she was unusable as soon as she was summoned.
 </p>
 <p>
  I could understand the situation indirectly, but Anytng wouldn’t have a clue.

 </div>
 <p>
  It was almost time for Anytng to log in.
 </p>
 <p>
  I tidied up the practice tools roughly and stood up.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  Click.
 </p>
 <p>
  Without knocking, I opened Wiryung’s door and went in.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the same as when I came in the morning.
 </p>
 <p>
  Wiryung was sitting on the bed, blankly staring at the floor,
 </p>
 <p>
  On the table, the fried eggs and milk had turned cold.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sat down on the bed.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Hey.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She still looked down without answering.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was like talking to a wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is a nuisance.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if I coaxed and comforted her, it wouldn’t be very useful.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was a special restriction on her engraving.
 </p>
 <p>
  At this rate, should she be synthesized?
 </p>
 <p>
  Being a natural 5-star, I would grow quite a bit if I consumed her.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sigh…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I let out a sigh deep enough to reach the ground.

 <p>
  Then I approached Wiryung and raised my right hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Snap out of it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Slap!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Wiryung, slapped, rolled over.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is this…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Wiryung looked up at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her right cheek was swelling red.
 </p>
 <p>
  I snorted and said,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t know what your problem is, but this is not Muryeon. If you don’t want to die, follow the rules here. Or should I synthesize you right away? Your experience points seem quite juicy.”
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  “I…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Wiryung’s expression changed as she looked at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally, she spoke in a low voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sorry. I was reminiscing about that time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That time?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “When Muryeon fell.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Wiryung’s eyes darkened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I… could do nothing. I was supposed to protect him… but I just…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stop annoying me with these sad stories.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Heh, that’s right. This isn’t Muryeon.”
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-7" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  Wiryung smiled bitterly.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like she had regained some of her senses.
 </p>
 <p>
  I handed her the cold milk from the table.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thanks.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let me tell you about your situation and what our current situation is.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You were summoned to Townia as a 5-star hero. And we’re facing a tough mission. We need all the help we can get, so we called you to use your full strength.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so? Another chance means this…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Another chance?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The priestess said so.”
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-12" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
  <script async="" crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4984013611805253">

 <p>
  The ‘priestess,’ another unfamiliar term came up again.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t hard to guess who it was.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Tel.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I knew that the top-ranked Muryeon account was annihilated for some reason.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether it was due to external invasion, mission failure, or some other reason.
 </p>
 <p>
  But now wasn’t the time to care about that. I might die anytime soon. As I said before, I really wanted any help I could get, even a finger from an ant.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anyway, tell me. Will you fight or not?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sorry… I can’t fight.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Wiryung shook her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I am bound by the Oath of the Sworn. I can’t properly wield a sword.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I clicked my tongue.
 </p>
 <p>
  At this rate, her future was clear.
 </p>
 <p>
  She would have to bear the consequences of her choice.
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned my back and walked to the door.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “By any chance, does this world belong to Zone 2?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Such vague terms were confusing.
 </p>
 <p>
  After thinking for a moment, I realized that ‘zone’ was synonymous with ‘server.’

  “And so what?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have a job to do. Help me just once.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re asking for help when you have no intention of pulling your weight?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at Wiryung with cold eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Wiryung swallowed hard.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I know it’s shameless. But… I must do this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “And what does that have to do with me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you help me, I’ll try my best too. Conditions might be met. Of course, it’s not a one-sided request. I will surely repay the favor.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll think about it if you’re useful.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Wiryung stood up.
 </p>

 <p>
  Oaths and conditions, it’s all a hassle.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s why 5-stars are no good.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shortly after.
 </p>
 <p>
  Wiryung and I arrived at the training room.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the center of the training room, there was a duel area surrounded by iron fences.
 </p>
 <p>
  “A duel?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I spoke to Wiryung standing in front of me.
 </p>

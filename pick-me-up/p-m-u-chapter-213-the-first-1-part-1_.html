  El Cid.
 </p>
 <p>
  The master, named after the legendary Spanish hero, was the first beta tester of “Pick Me Up.”

 <p>
  Additionally, he was the first ranker, the first to possess a 7-star, and the first to clear the 80th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  And currently, he holds the number one ranking.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although he barely participated in the community, he was the reason I, a mere light user, became deeply engrossed in “Pick Me Up.” Initially, I regarded the game as just another pay-to-win, but my perception changed dramatically after encountering him.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;If destroying Muryeon is possible, he’s the only one who can do it.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  I nodded at Yurnet’s words.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the third ranker is excellent, he falls far short compared to Muryeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  The following ranks were similar. And since Muryeon doesn’t actively tackle missions, there’s only one reason he would collapse.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you know him?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Wiryung squinted at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  She seemed puzzled.
 </p>
 <p>
  Understandably so.
 </p>
 <p>
  The number one ranker disappeared a year ago in real-world time.
 </p>
 <p>
  In Mobius time, it has been well over three years. As sub-master of Townia, my activity time didn’t align with someone like him, so my reaction was suspicious.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve heard of him before.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anyway, I need to relay this news to the rumor lord of Tachunhyang.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “And what will you achieve by doing that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I can’t say that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She’s full of secrets.

  I placed the practice iron sword on the display stand.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Master, what will you do? By the way, the repairs to Bifrost are complete. Why don’t you take this opportunity to visit Niflheimr?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “….”
 </p>
 <p>
  At this timing.
 </p>
 <p>
  I frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it were after clearing the 50th floor, it might be possible, but now I was in the middle of a busy period.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Everyone is being a bother.’
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;…Master.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Fine. I’ll come.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I could spare a day or two.

 <p>
  &lt;I’ll prepare then.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet ended the communication with a slightly brighter voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  I spoke to Wiryung, who was staring at me with eager eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You wanted to go to Niflheimr, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. It doesn’t matter how long it takes. I….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll send you today.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Wiryung’s eyes widened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you mean by that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I told you I have connections. I’ll come to pick you up at dawn, so be ready.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you serious?!”
 </p>

 <p>
  Wiryung rushed to me and grasped my hand tightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her eyebrows were even wet.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you so much! I’ll never forget this favor. I’ll repay it with all my heart!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright, let go of my hand. Wait quietly in your room. Don’t wander off.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I understand! I’ll stay quietly, like a mouse, no, like a corpse!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…There’s no need for that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Wiryung hurriedly ran out of the training center, regardless of my words.
 </p>
 <p>
  Left alone, I sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It would be nice if he stayed quiet.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The golden village, El Cid’s domain, was strong enough that Niflheimr would have to prepare for a total war.

 <p>
  I couldn’t grasp the exact strength, but knowing his capabilities, he must have grown tremendously. If a conflict occurred between the two, I couldn’t stay in Townia any longer. I would have to command them directly.
 </p>
 <p>
  I recalled the number one ranker’s play.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although there were no videos or guides, I happened to see his play by chance.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I understand it now.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, as a hero who fell here, I could understand things I didn’t back then.
 </p>
 <p>
  He already knew that the heroes of “Pick Me Up” were alive.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The timing of El Cid’s disappearance and obtaining the 7-star is similar.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He likely disappeared because of the 7-star.
 </p>
 <p>
  Probably, it was the Book of Reversal.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Then, is the current ruler a hero, not a master?’
 </p>

 <p>
  I couldn’t be sure.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the condition for advancing to 7-star is the fusion of hero and master, it’s not 100% certain.
 </p>
 <p>
  To understand how Muryeon fell, what El Cid did, and what message Wiryung has for us, I had to go to Niflheimr.
 </p>
 <p>
  That night, I asked Iselle to manipulate the logs.
 </p>
 <p>
  I requested her to erase the log showing that a Niflheimr airship was dispatched and to make it appear as if Wiryung and I had gone to the weekday dungeon if we didn’t return by the next day. Iselle readily agreed, and at dawn, a small Niflheimr airship secretly docked at Townia.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who’s you’re connection in Tachunhyang? For a single word from you to bring an airship immediately, you must be quite something.”
 </p>
 <p>
  On the airship to Niflheimr, Wiryung spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even her manner of address had changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “….”
 </p>
 <p>
  I kept silent.
 </p>

 <p>
  She would find out eventually, but I didn’t want to reveal my identity here.
 </p>
 <p>
  The airship Yurnet sent seemed to be a high-speed model; we arrived at a place of lightning and brimstone in less than an hour.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was Niflheimr.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whrrr.
 </p>
 <p>
  The dimensional vortex began to envelop the airship.
 </p>
 <p>
  When the light faded, I was not greeted by a hangar but by the scenery of the 13th floor of Niflheimr, with its five distinct regions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang.
 </p>
 <p>
  The airship that had dropped off Wiryung and me slid down to the lower floor with a small mechanical sound.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Apologies for the late hour. We have been expecting you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet bowed deeply to me.

 <p>
  I shook my head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s fine. I called because I needed to.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anyway, I have prepared a place. Please follow me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Wiryung tilted her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  I spoke to Wiryung, who couldn’t grasp the situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Follow me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet guided us to the pitch-black castle in the center of the 13th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a place prepared for my return. In the hall on the first floor, a large conference table was set up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please sit here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet pulled out the chair at the head of the table.
 </p>
 <p>
  And she patted the cushion, signaling me to sit.
 </p>
 <p>
  “….”
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, it’s not the first time.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sighed and sat down.

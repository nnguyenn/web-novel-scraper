 <p>
  I furrowed my brow.
 </p>
 <p>
  If I wasn’t careful, I could lose a hero in the engraving ceremony.

 <p>
  Raising elite heroes wasn’t easy, so if one of the strategy team members died, it would be a huge loss.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you saying to use two engravings together?”
 </p>
 <p>
  That was also challenging.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Black Dragon Blood was not a power that could be mastered in a day or two.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a top-tier engraving that had to be steadily developed until reaching the max level at 6-star.
 </p>
 <p>
  And now, adding another one.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s not impossible.
 </p>
 <p>
  But using both together would take quite a while to get used to.
 </p>
 <p>
  Trying to master the White Dragon Blood in this phase might end up with neither one fully utilized.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I need to think about it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  High return, high risk.
 </p>
 <p>
  Using the White Dragon Blood was too much of a gamble.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Excuse me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  While I was deep in thought, the door suddenly opened.
 </p>
 <p>
  Goo Goo Con and I turned to the entrance simultaneously.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was Velkist.
 </p>
 <p>
  Drenched in sweat, it seemed he had just finished training.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist walked straight toward me and Goo Goo Con.
 </p>

 <p>
  “What’s up?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I heard your voice while passing by. I apologize if I interrupted. More importantly…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kweh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist grabbed Goo Goo Con by the scruff and lifted him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You rude punk!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So this sparrow was the source of your power.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t take me for a fool. I’ve just been pretending not to know.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You brat! Let go right now!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The pigeon flapped its wings frantically, but Velkist didn’t budge.
 </p>

 <p>
  Goo Goo Con dangled from Velkist’s fingers.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you doing, Han! Why are you not kicking this insolent brat out immediately!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  I silently watched Velkist.
 </p>
 <p>
  He maintained his usual expressionless face, but there was something in his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Velkist.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Han!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you want to get stronger?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist smirked.
 </p>
 <p>
  The meaning was clear: there was no need to ask.

 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He must have figured out the situation by recalling what I said outside.
 </p>
 <p>
  He must have been listening from the beginning.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It felt odd. I thought I had caught up, but you kept getting further away. It’s unfair for you to use special powers alone, senior.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist said self-deprecatingly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even that talentless spearman has risen higher, while I don’t know what I’m doing lying down.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You fool! The power of the ancient species is not something a mere human can use. If someone unfit tries to wield it, they will be destroyed!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist looked at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is it squawking about?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He said if someone unworthy tries to use the power, they will be destroyed.”

  “Ask him to evaluate me too. Am I special?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The pigeon flapped its wings roughly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Judging by Goo Goo Con’s reaction, there seemed to be nothing special about Velkist.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was just a human with outstanding talent.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t for me to decide in the first place.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether to handle that power or not is up to the individual.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems not. That’s disappointing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Again…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s no need to warn me.”

 <p>
  Velkist already had an engraving.
 </p>
 <p>
  A mental skill-related engraving called Wildness, it wasn’t of a high grade, but it was versatile and safe.
 </p>
 <p>
  If Velkist wanted the White Dragon Blood, he would first have to erase his existing engraving.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Assinis may not favor this guy. If so, he will die!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist let go of the pigeon.
 </p>
 <p>
  Freed from its grip, the pigeon squawked and spread its wings.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This rude brat! If my true power returns, I’ll cut you to pieces!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s it been squawking about since earlier?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t mind it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sure.”
 </p>

 <p>
  Let’s see.
 </p>
 <p>
  Assuming the White Dragon Blood is an S-class engraving, I calculated the probability of completing the summoning dungeon and successfully imprinting it, considering Velkist’s current grade and abilities.
 </p>
 <p>
  “About 2 percent.”
 </p>
 <p>
  One success in 50 attempts.
 </p>
 <p>
  If I were a master, I wouldn’t attempt such an impossible task.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even after success, it would be the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  A power unmatched to a hero’s level often causes a disaster.
 </p>
 <p>
  Like the contamination state triggered when I used the Dragon’s Descent. I managed to escape with Goo Goo Con’s help, but Velkist might not be so fortunate.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve heard about the contamination state from the archer. If I get contaminated and get stuck, please take care of me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-12" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  “So, will you allow it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This brat, are you serious… giving our great power to a mere human…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I placed the feed bowl in front of the struggling Goo Goo Con.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Eat a lot today. If there’s anything you want to eat, let me know.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kukukook!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I buried Goo Goo Con’s beak in the feed bowl.
 </p>
 <p>
  And whispered very quietly, so only Goo Goo Con could hear.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I think this is the right thing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I repeat, I cannot guarantee your subordinate’s life!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I know. But what can I do when he insists on doing it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I was more aware than anyone of Velkist’s efforts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Training from morning till night, he sweated and bled without stopping.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he had gone to another account, he would have been treated as the top and played a significant role as an ace. He was that excellent. But… he was unlucky.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If he has enough talent, effort, and mental strength, eventually, it’s just a matter of having a chance.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In the past, I would have rejected it outright.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he failed, it would be a huge loss.
 </p>
 <p>
  But after watching Aaron overwhelm that task, my mind changed a bit.
 </p>
 <p>
  It might be a futile hope, but I decided to bet on it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can’t fight alone forever.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I don’t need subordinates who will clean up after me.

  What I need now are comrades who can stand shoulder-to-shoulder with me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a power that doesn’t suit a mere human.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If that’s the case, then just help him.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I released my hand pressing down on Goo Goo Con’s head.
 </p>
 <p>
  The pigeon pulled its beak out of the feed bowl and glared at Velkist.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmph, you’ll see the fate of those who have the illusion of easily becoming stronger….”
 </p>
 <p>
  Goo Goo Con, staring into Velkist’s eyes, fell silent.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, as if whispering, he said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This guy is crazy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”

  “It will happen even if you don’t like it.”

  Goo Goo Con picked up the White Dragon’s shed skin with his wings and walked out.

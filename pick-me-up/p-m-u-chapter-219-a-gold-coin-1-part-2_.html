  [Corrupted Goblin Lv.38] X 31
 </p>
 <p>
  Their once green skin had turned black.

 <p>
  Their bodies were bulging with hideous veins.
 </p>
 <p>
  Level 38. The monsters here were not only numerous but also significantly stronger.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘……Sigh.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I could only sigh.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the current forces, we couldn’t engage in a full-scale battle with them.
 </p>
 <p>
  The only viable tactics were luring and mobile warfare using airships.
 </p>
 <p>
  Avoiding battles as much as possible and quickly eliminating the egg with a completed key.
 </p>
 <p>
  Easier said than done.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even mobile warfare required a sturdy shield at the front to be effective.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is the limit.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon, I reached the edge of where observation was possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  Beyond this point, I couldn’t pass due to the transparent wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took in the scenery of the forest once more before turning back.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, Oppa, how many are there?”
 </p>
 <p>
  At the gathering place on the outskirts of the forest, Jenna approached me with quick steps and asked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You can see for yourself. There are too many.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s an overwhelming number!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The stench is so bad it’s hard to breathe. The whole forest reeks.”
 </p>

 <p>
  Kishasha wrinkled her nose.
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio, who was checking the exploration magic circle set up in the corner, also spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The church’s forces are likely in the forest’s interior as well. Combining the monsters and the church’s forces, the number easily exceeds ten thousand.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ten thousand? That’s a bit… extreme.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I wonder how we ended up in such a place. We’ve been utterly deceived.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio let out a deep sigh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria remained silent with a gloomy expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  Everyone’s faces were grim.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What should we do then? Are there any other places we should check? What about that Assinis place? Isn’t there a chance they’ll change their minds and help us?”
 </p>
 <p>
  If that were the case, we could solve this problem.
 </p>

 <p>
  Even though their successor and expedition were wiped out, the Assinis family wasn’t destroyed.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to Pria, they still had a significant number of troops.
 </p>
 <p>
  They just didn’t want to help us.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m sorry. If only I had persuaded them better….”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria bowed her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not your fault. It’s just the situation that’s messed up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In the original scenario of Townia, we would have proceeded with the mission strategy with the powerful Assinis family.
 </p>
 <p>
  But things got severely messed up when Delphine died on the 45th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had hoped history would be corrected and Delphine would come back to life as we moved up the floors, but that didn’t happen.
 </p>
 <p>
  The story of Assinis’s expedition being annihilated remained, and Assinis, who lost their successor following Pria’s advice, became distrustful of her.

 <p>
  “Isn’t everyone is… our enemy now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio looked back at me and said.
 </p>
 <p>
  I nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Groups belonging to the empire.
 </p>
 <p>
  Three of the four major families were initially in the enemy camp.
 </p>
 <p>
  The empire’s guards and the church’s forces were also enemies, and the only neutral Assinis turned their back on us.
 </p>
 <p>
  All major armed groups in Townia had turned against us.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is crazy. What do we do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio scratched his head irritably.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shouldn’t we stay calm? This isn’t the first time we’ve faced such enemies. Right?”
 </p>

  “That’s true, but….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If we look for a way gradually, we’ll find it. If worse comes to worst, we’ll manage by ourselves. We’ve prepared so hard, we won’t lose, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We need to analyze the situation once more. Let’s see….”
 </p>
 <p>
  The first party members were having a heated discussion.
 </p>
 <p>
  I, who had been standing back, retreated outside.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where are you going?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna asked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “For a breath of fresh air.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I gave a rough answer and walked toward the outskirts of the forest.
 </p>
 <p>
  Worrying in a cramped place wouldn’t help.
 </p>

 <p>
  Even on Earth, I used to go for walks when strategies hit a snag.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s somewhat better.’
 </p>
 <p>
  While the inside of the forest was dark, the outside was relatively okay.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sunlight filtered through well, and the trees and leaves were green.
 </p>
 <p>
  It looked more like a forest.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even the outer edges of the forest were divided into accessible and inaccessible areas.
 </p>
 <p>
  I pushed through the roots of a large tree and bushes, moving outward.
 </p>
 <p>
  The mission showed no sign of ending soon. I intended to move as far as I could.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Are there monsters here too?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I stopped my steps.

  In the distance, I sensed a faint presence.
 </p>
 <p>
  The presence was slowly approaching where I was.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…….’
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t a monster.
 </p>
 <p>
  Noticing that, I hid in the bushes.
 </p>
 <p>
  After about five minutes, they revealed themselves.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Two.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Two men were walking down the path.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were moving outside the transparent wall where I couldn’t go.
 </p>
 <p>
  They weren’t church soldiers.
 </p>

 <p>
  They were dressed in well-organized leather armor and armed with weapons at their waists.
 </p>
 <p>
  The man on the left looked no older than his early twenties. He still had a youthful appearance.
 </p>
 <p>
  The man on the right had a rough, seasoned look as if he had been through a lot.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why did we come to a place like this? There’s so much to do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The rough-looking man grumbled.
 </p>
 <p>
  His voice and tone didn’t match his face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just look at it. That weird-looking egg is supposed to bring peace? Who believes that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t it the church’s word? We have no choice but to follow it. And if you really wanted to investigate, you could have sent the subordinates.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Subordinates? What subordinates? They’re employees.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re your subordinates, brother.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re ten years older than me!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The young man and the rough-looking man kept bickering as they walked through the forest.
 </p>
 <p>
  I observed the young man. The rough-looking man called him brother.
 </p>
 <p>
  His body was well-balanced, and his walking posture was steady.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He’s quite strong.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Clearly, he had undergone extensive training.
 </p>
 <p>
  Additionally… there was a familiar yet strange smell.
 </p>
 <p>
  Something indescribable.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pajijik.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at my left arm.

  A dark red lightning flickered and disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…….’
 </p>
 <p>
  The young man with a cheerful expression looked across the forest and spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There are a lot of monsters. More than I can count. They’re swarming.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aren’t the high-ups handling it? Now that you mention it, there have been almost no monster attacks lately. Maybe the lords are gathering them to deal with them all at once? Peaceful, indeed!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This… smells fishy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The young man frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you planning an attack with the guys?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Attack what? How can we handle this much? It’s just suspicious, that’s all.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why can’t we? Are you forgetting who you are? You’re the idol of all mercenaries in Townia! You conquered all the dungeons on the continent in less than ten years… What a feat! That’s why I follow you as my brother. If you say the word, thousands of mercenaries in Townia will rise like a swarm!”

 <p>
  “Don’t call me brother.”

 <p>
  “Then the Mercenary King!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who’s the Mercenary King?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who else but you could be called the Mercenary King?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The man chuckled.

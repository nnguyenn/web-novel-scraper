 <p>
  I opened my eyes, greeted by a sight above my room—a sky that was tinted with a pale, ashen hue. It seemed to be the early hours of the morning, judging by its brightness.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shaking off sleep, I rose from my bed and splashed water on my face from the bowl that had been left by Chloe. Every dawn, she would diligently provide water to all the rooms in the facility.

  As I stepped into the lobby, a delightful aroma tickled my senses. Glancing at the clock, it displayed 5:45 a.m. I made my way to the dining area and picked up a perfectly roasted potato from the table.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you up? It’s a beautiful morning,” Chloe, who was busily heating stew in the kitchen, greeted me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I gazed at the sky, wondering what made it such a wonderful morning.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you heading out early again today?” she asked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah,” I replied.
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t afford to miss a day of training. Moreover, I needed to put the skills I acquired from yesterday’s battle to the test.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How about joining others for a meal once in a while? It can get lonely eating by yourself all the time, you know,” Chloe suggested.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Maybe, if I feel like it,” I replied noncommittally, peeling the potato and making my way to the kitchen.
 </p>
 <p>
  The waiting room was bustling with activity, and a sense of order had taken hold. Over time, a few rules had been established, one of which was gathering together for meals. Soon, the other residents would emerge from their rooms, having awakened from their slumber.
 </p>
 <p>
  I, however, remained an exception to this rule.
 </p>
 <p>
  A vivid image of Chloe’s bright, yet swollen eyes flashed in my mind. She had been working tirelessly. Zeeth and Hanson followed her lead in assisting with the daily task of preparing meals for twenty people. It was no easy feat, and I remembered how the three of us frequently offered our help, knowing how little rest Chloe took.
 </p>
 <p>
  With those thoughts in mind, I made my way to the training grounds.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna was there, drenched in sweat as she expertly wielded her dagger.
 </p>
 <p>
  That girl, always claiming to need more sleep, and complaining all the time about training early in the morning; this is a new thing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s gotten into you?” I asked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t want to end up dead!” Jenna replied, her voice determined.
 </p>
 <p>
  She gracefully executed aerial maneuvers, launching a rapid succession of strikes with her dagger.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t particularly surprising anymore. Jenna possessed an exceptional sense of balance and agility, surpassing that of other heroes. Even I struggled to keep up with her movements. With her lightning-fast reflexes, she could probably traverse various terrains and objects effortlessly.

 <p>
  “In contrast, Aaron…” I muttered under my breath.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite surviving last night’s battle, he hadn’t acquired any new skills.
 </p>
 <p>
  He still relied on that single, basic spear technique.
 </p>
 <p>
  Securing sandbags around my ankles and wrists, I adjusted their weight until they totaled around 10 kilograms. With a determined stride, I set off on a slow jog around the training field. Jenna kept pace beside me, her presence motivating.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the speed at which we ran, I found myself not gasping for breath.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mid-run, I tossed the sandbags aside, disappointed by the minimal impact they had on my exercise. The same applied to push-ups—they offered little challenge.
 </p>
 <p>
  Curious, I inverted my body and performed backward arm bends.
 </p>
 <p>
  Surprisingly, it worked.
 </p>
 <p>
  I could feel the weight gradually taking its toll.
 </p>
 <p>
  As my level increased, my body surpassed the capabilities of an average person. Strength, stamina, endurance, reflexes—every aspect had undergone a remarkable transformation. If I were to return to Earth in this state, I might even consider pursuing a career in a sport.

  My once ordinary adult physique had developed solid, lean muscles. A glance in the mirror would reveal a distinct six-pack, not the bulging muscles of a bodybuilder, but the practical, functional muscles of a skilled martial artist.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh my.”
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, I decided to challenge myself by doing push-ups with my left hand lifted off the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally, it felt like a real workout. At the same time, my body’s instability demanded balance, making it a great posture to improve both strength and balance.
 </p>
 <p>
  I accessed my “Status Window.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Han Iselle (★) Level 9 (Exp 54/70)]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Class: Novice]
 </p>
 <p>

 <p>
  [Agility: 21/21]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Skills: Low-level Swordsmanship (Level 5), Pain Resistance (Level 2), Composure (Level 3), Fury (Level 1)]
 </p>
 <p>
  My strength increased by 3, stamina by 1, agility by 1, and intelligence decreased by 1.
 </p>
 <p>
  The total growth value was 5. Since the previous level-up, the growth value had remained fixed at 5. It was an extraordinary and elastic value that one would typically see at the third level.
 </p>
 <p>
  My skills had also made significant progress.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had managed to level up my skills five times in a single battle. This phenomenon, known as skill awakening, was a rare occurrence that heroes experienced during combat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not bad.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The current trend of growth was quite promising.
 </p>
 <p>
  Except for the fact that I acquired the unexpected skill of Fury, everything was going according to plan. I would gradually discover how Composure and Fury could harmonize.
 </p>
 <p>
  Maintaining a firm stance, I bent my right arm and extended it.
 </p>

 <p>
  The effect was akin to lifting and lowering a 70kg weight with a single hand. Yet, my right arm showed no signs of slowing down.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though my stats had not yet reached 20, I couldn’t help but wonder how much more I would transform when I surpassed 100. Would I possess the ability to tear down walls or pierce through steel plates with my fingertips, like the martial arts masters?
 </p>
 <p>
  Coincidentally, I was nearing level 10. The timing couldn’t be more perfect. I could obtain the necessary materials for promotion from the newly unlocked weekly dungeon I ventured into yesterday.
 </p>
 <p>
  However…
 </p>
 <p>
  “What on earth are you doing?” I inquired, still in the firm position.
 </p>
 <p>
  Due to my posture, my shirt had slid down, revealing my sculpted abs. Jenna gently caressed them.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, they looked irresistible,” she replied.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Could you please not touch them?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why should I refrain? It’s not like it’s bothering you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s bothering me, so please remove your hand.”
 </p>

 <p>
  I flexed and extended my arm, utilizing the momentum to execute a full-body flip.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even my current self was capable of such acrobatics.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Speaking of which, this girl…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The more I observe her, the more audacious she becomes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the experience we had yesterday,s he shamelessly persists in her behavior the following day.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s not my place to say anything, though.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps Jenna’s approach is the correct one.
 </p>
 <p>
  We must not dwell on the past. What truly matters is what we need to do at present and the tasks we can accomplish. As long as we remember this simple fact, we can maintain composure even in a place like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  From that perspective, Jenna’s greatest talent may lie not in marksmanship or physical prowess, but rather in those psychological aspects.
 </p>
 <p>
  Today’s basic stamina training concluded rather swiftly.

  Although lunchtime was still a while away, we immediately transitioned to weapon training. It was now more efficient to invest time in honing our weapon skills rather than focusing solely on stamina. As always, we assumed our stances.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Preparations seem to be in order. Shall we proceed as usual today?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I nodded in agreement.

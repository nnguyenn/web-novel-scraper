  “Come here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria patted the spot next to her. I sat down without a word, and Pria started to massage my shoulders.

  “This shoulder bears the future of Townia. If it doesn’t relax properly, we’re in trouble.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It didn’t feel much. Like a feather brushing against me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It reminds me of old times.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria whispered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I used to massage the prince’s shoulders like this. He said my massages were the best. I wonder what he’s doing now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He’s alive, I’m sure.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s a relief. It’s been almost ten years since I entered the palace. I wish I could see his face at least once.”
 </p>
 <p>
  You’ll see the prince’s face soon enough. Not in the way you hope.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Listen, Pria. There’s something you need to do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehe, I’m good at massages. Do you want me to do it for all five of you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria continued to gently pat my shoulder blades.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……Have you heard of the Mercenary King?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm, the Mercenary King. I think I remember. Ah! I heard from a bard in a tavern. He and his companions conquered dungeons across the continent. But why?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You need to leave immediately and recruit this Mercenary King.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria’s hand stopped. I continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  “He seems to have a significant influence in the mercenary world. If we can recruit him, we might get reinforcements for this battle. As you can see, we can’t leave here. We’re tied to the mission. You’re the only one who can do it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can’t you do it?”
 </p>

 <p>
  I turned to look at Pria. She was blinking rapidly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You want me to bring him?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I heard many wealthy people tried to make a contract with him but failed. Why would such a big shot talk to me, a mere fallen princess? I have no money or honor. I’m just a powerless…… ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria bit her lip.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sorry, it seems I was gonna make the same mistake again. I was about to run away again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If it’s too hard, you don’t have to do it. We’ll find another way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No. I’ll go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He should be nearby.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll find him immediately!”

 <p>
  Pria stood up. She started walking towards the path leading outside, determined to find the Mercenary King.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Isn’t she being too rush?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I called out.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Pria.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “……?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Tell him that Han Israt has come to collect the gold coin.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A gold coin?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He’ll understand. The rest is up to you. I’m counting on you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pria flinched slightly. I smiled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good luck.”

  Pria slowly nodded and then moved forward. As she did, a light enveloped us.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stage Clear!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Jenna(★★★★)’, ‘Kishasha(★★★★)’ leveled up!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Reward – 300,000G, Forest Essence (Intermediate) x 3, Planks (A) x 13]
 </p>
 <p>
  [MVP – ‘Han(★★★★)’]
 </p>
 <p>
  The stage clear message appeared. Looking back, I saw the members returning to the waiting room one by one.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Finally.’
 </p>
 <p>
  There wasn’t much time left until the 50th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no time to rest. I started organizing tasks in the waiting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Particles of light enveloped me.

 </p>
 <p>
  ‘……?’
 </p>
 <p>
  As I was preparing to return, a strange message appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Restoring……]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Connection to the server was lost due to an error. Please wait a moment.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Static.
 </p>
 <p>
  The leaves swaying in the wind froze in place.
 </p>
 <p>
  The forest scenery turned a cold, ashen grey.
 </p>
 <p>
  This wasn’t the first time.
 </p>
 <p>
  It happened once before.

  10th floor. When Tell directly intervened in the mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Someone’s here.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I tried to turn around.
 </p>
 <p>
  「Stay still.」
 </p>
 <p>
  An unidentified voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gender and tone were indistinguishable.
 </p>
 <p>
  「It’s been a long time since I received a massage from that child.」
 </p>
 <p>
  “……What is this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  「It’s just a brief greeting before we meet on the battlefield.」
 </p>
 <p>
  A greeting?
 </p>

  「Han Israt, we intend to test your qualifications. If you truly wish to conquer the tower and learn the hidden truth of Mobius, overcome the absurdities that lie ahead.」
 </p>
 <p>
  “……”
 </p>

 </p>
 <p>
  The scenery regained its color.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Restoration complete!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Reconnecting to the server. We apologize for the inconvenience.]
 </p>
 <p>
  I immediately turned around.

 <p>
  There was only a pile of fallen leaves.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Was that a declaration of war?’
 </p>
 <p>
  It seems the prince can really use the interference power.
 </p>
 <p>
  He briefly imitated Tell’s actions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Destroy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Is that what Perseane meant by liberation?
 </p>
 <p>
  He seemed to be making a big deal out of it, but it didn’t matter.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The prince will appear on the 50th floor.’
 </p>
 <p>
  He won’t be able to directly fight due to the level difference, but he would cause trouble from afar.
 </p>
 <p>
  If I were him, I wouldn’t have given such a hint.
 </p>
 <p>
  Light enveloped my body, and when I opened my eyes again, I was back in the dimensional rift.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked ahead.
 </p>
 <p>
  The mirror in the center of the room glimmered faintly.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Climb the tower and save the world!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Main Dungeon: Current Climb Floor – 47]
 </p>
 <p>
  Climb the tower and save the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s a phrase I’ve seen thousands of times as a master and now as a hero.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’m utterly tired of it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oppa, what’s wrong?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nothing.”

  Jenna looked at me curiously from outside.
 </p>
 <p>
  I shook my head and followed her into the plaza.
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s a lot to do.
 </p>
 <p>
  The 50th floor was just around the corner.

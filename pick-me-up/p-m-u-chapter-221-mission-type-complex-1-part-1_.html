 <p>
  Time flowed without stopping.
 </p>
 <p>
  While continuing to train my weapon skills and the Black Dragon’s Blood, I also handled the duties in the waiting room during my spare time.

 <p>
  I checked the heroes’ training progress and the construction progress of the airships, organized parties considering the heroes’ temperaments and professions, and designated leaders for each party.
 </p>
 <p>
  The final decision on party composition was up to the Master, but Anytng never rejected my suggestions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, now on the eve of the 50th-floor raid, Townia’s forces exceeded our expectations.
 </p>
 <p>
  Five combat airships.
 </p>
 <p>
  Approximately four hundred heroes.
 </p>
 <p>
  An incredible force for a 49th-level account.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Our rear defenses are also perfect.’
 </p>
 <p>
  While the main force was on a mission, the defensive troops led by Wiryung would guard the waiting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  They had already successfully repelled a couple of invasions.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Velkist is back.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I thought Velkist would return just before departure, but he came back much earlier than expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t ask Velkist about the success of his mission. Just by looking at his expression, I knew the result. Goo Goo Con was clicking his tongue in disbelief.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘My level has increased enough.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Level 53.
 </p>
 <p>
  That was my current level.
 </p>
 <p>
  We cleared the 48th floor after the 47th, and we safely broke through to the 49th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Coincidentally, there was a mission on the 49th floor where we could gain a lot of experience by hunting monsters.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although we couldn’t upgrade to a 5-star rating due to the lack of experience points, we reached the limit of the 4-star rating.

 <p>
  This was the same for the other members as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Black Dragon’s Blood, which had been stuck at stage 3, recently broke through to stage 4.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, I wouldn’t lose in a 1-on-1 fight against any average boss monster.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before entering the main raid, Anytng wanted to send unnecessary heroes as a vanguard to the 50th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  He probably wanted to understand the patterns in advance.
 </p>
 <p>
  [※Mission deployment impossible!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [This mission requires an airship!]
 </p>
 <p>
  However, when Anytng touched the deployment button, a message popped up, and the mission window closed.
 </p>
 <p>
  A mission requiring an airship. However, there were no airships in Townia that could be discarded as a sacrificial pawn. In the end, we had to give up on the vanguard reconnaissance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, we had only one choice left.
 </p>

 <p>
  To gather all our forces and breakthrough in one go, just as we had always done.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus again,
 </p>
 <p>
  The time for departure came.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Take a deep breath, take a deep breath!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Rain, the twin mage from Party 2, patted Edis on the back.
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis, with a pale face, was reading the paper in front of her.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, can’t Han do it? I can’t do this…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But you’re the leader.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No! The raid leader should be the sub-master!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But you’re good at leading people.”

  “What are you talking about? I’m trembling to death.”
 </p>
 <p>
  This place was the hangar located in the dimensional rift.
 </p>
 <p>
  A vast space that could be called the second plaza.
 </p>
 <p>
  All the combatants belonging to Townia gathered in the dimensional rift. They stood in line, looking up at us on the podium, specifically at Edis, who was appointed as the commander of this raid.
 </p>
 <p>
  Behind the heroes were five airships lined up.
 </p>
 <p>
  The airships, named Capitalism, Lusette, Tier, Easy, and Fran, were all set to participate in this mission. Heroes responsible for piloting, maintenance, and artillery stood on their decks.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Giving a speech out of nowhere, a mere mercenary like me…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A pre-battle speech is essential for morale, don’t you think?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Absolutely! Absolutely!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Rain and Main echoed my words.

  “If the leader can’t step up, how can the subordinates go!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Exactly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is crazy…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I left the sweating Edis and came down from the podium.
 </p>
 <p>
  There, the members of Party 1, responsible for hitting key points under the mobile force in this mission, were gathered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There are more enemies than expected. Can we manage with this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Katiio sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had said that a hundred times since returning from the 47th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aren’t reinforcements coming? Wasn’t it the Mercenary King?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We don’t even know if they’re coming. We should exclude uncertain forces.”
 </p>

  “They’re not uncertain.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So they’re definitely coming?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If my prediction is correct.”
 </p>
 <p>
  They wouldn’t appear for no reason during a mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the system was working properly, Pria would surely return.
 </p>
 <p>
  The problem was whether we could hold out until then.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Dad is coming, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kishasha clenched her fists.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Will you be alright?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It doesn’t matter. I’ve barely seen him. He’s said to be the strongest warrior, so I just want to fight him.”
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-7" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  Kishasha’s face hardened coldly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though she said it didn’t matter, it wouldn’t feel good to hunt down someone she shared blood with.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Velkist, are you ready?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Always ready. I want to use it as soon as possible.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist grinned sardonically.
 </p>
 <p>
  He would use it so much that he’d get sick of it once the actual battle started.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Hmph, that lowlife has obtained power unbefitting him.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Halkion’s voice echoed in my ears.
 </p>
 <p>
  Originally, he was supposed to join us in the form of a pigeon, but Kishasha’s rampage prevented that.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, as long as we could communicate remotely, it didn’t mean we couldn’t use the power of the Black Dragon’s Blood.
 </p>

 <p>
  “This is always nerve-wracking.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna was taking slow, taking deep breaths.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I hope no one dies this time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s not possible.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I know. I just hope the members of Party 1 are safe. We don’t want to go through what happened on the 35th floor again, do we? You or I.”
 </p>
 <p>
  That was true.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the podium.
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis, with a stiff expression, was stepping up to the lectern.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hah.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis took a deep breath and opened her mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the speech began.
 </p>
 <p>
  The content was nothing special.
 </p>
 <p>
  In summary, ‘everything in the waiting room depends on this battle.’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Everything.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was true.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng invested everything in her account for this raid.
  <br/>
  (T/N: Lately in the original Korean text the author started to refer to Anytng as a female, so it seems it’s finally confirmed that she’s a female player.)
 </p>
 <p>
  If the heroes were annihilated, the waiting room would suffer irreparable damage.
 </p>
 <p>
  Given that we had gathered forces beyond our capacity, it was uncertain whether we could rebuild a similar force again.
 </p>
 <p>
  In other words, Anytng had bet too many chips.
 </p>
 <p>
  This attempt would likely be the last.
 </p>

 <p>
  ‘It’s a wonder she didn’t give up.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A single touch could end everything we had built so far.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some masters, unable to withstand this pressure, voluntarily gave up while preparing for the raid.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how many missions I had been through, my hands always trembled when pressing the deployment button.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fortunately, Anytng, like me, only hesitated briefly and did not give up on the mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  [※Caution!]

  A large-scale mission on just the 50th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  We were unfortunate to get such a mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There is no vanguard.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as the mission started, Townia’s raid would be deployed simultaneously.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Han, we must win!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle, with a victory headband tied on her forehead, pointed at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  [No matter who it is or what tricks they pull!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled.

 <p>
  The majestic deer bounded forward with explosive speed.
 </p>
 <p>
  I twisted my waist just in the nick of time to evade its charge. The deer’s antlers struck the tree, tearing it apart completely. The forest echoed with a thunderous crash as the tree began to tilt.

 <p>
  “Well, trying to stop it would be futile.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The deer shook its head, dislodging the shattered fragments of wood, and lunged at me once more.
 </p>
 <p>
  It felt as if a massive 1.5-ton truck was accelerating at full throttle. Rolling on the ground, I narrowly avoided its path and managed to grasp its leg.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, the wound inflicted was superficial. The deer’s thick hide and muscular frame offered substantial protection.
 </p>
 <p>
  I rose to my feet, bracing myself for what would be its third charge.
 </p>
 <p>
  Let’s give it a try.
 </p>
 <p>
  Halting its relentless advance seemed impossible. Evading it completely was out of the question. Any failed attempt would result in my body being torn asunder. In that case…
 </p>
 <p>
  I positioned myself against the sturdy trunk of an arim tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a cloud of dust billowing behind it, the deer raced forward. Every impact of its hooves caused the ground to sink, leaving deep imprints—a testament to its astonishing leaping power.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as its twisted antlers threatened to rend my body, I swiftly sidestepped.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thump!
 </p>
 <p>
  The antlers of the Forest Queen impaled the tree trunk. Even plunging a sword into such a thick tree was far from guaranteed, yet the deer accomplished it effortlessly.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the deer violently shook its head from side to side, splintered fragments danced through the air. The tree, too, was on the verge of collapse. Seizing the opportunity, I swiftly moved away.
 </p>
 <p>
  The immobilized deer kicked its hind leg, and although I blocked it with my shield, the impact reverberated through me like a resounding blow of a sledgehammer.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Damn, it’s relentless.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sensation faded from my left arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gripping my right hand firmly around the hilt of the iron sword, I launched myself toward the deer’s hindquarters. Once again, it struck out with its hind leg. I contorted my upper body, narrowly evading it. My collarbone narrowly escaped shattering into pieces.
 </p>
 <p>
  I thrust my sword into the deer’s haunch, encountering a formidable resistance akin to piercing through layers of sturdy fabric. Though the blade didn’t penetrate fully, I persevered, twisting it forcefully.

 <p>
  Enraged, the deer shattered the right side of the arim tree, turning its body to swing its antlers.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had no intention of confronting those lethal antlers head-on. With my entire body lowered, almost as if prostrating myself, I braced for what came next.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  A powerful gust of wind brushed against my ear.
 </p>
 <p>
  I swiftly rose to my feet, readjusting the grip on the shield in my left hand. The sword blade remained embedded in the deer’s haunch.
 </p>
 <p>
  Completing another rotation with its antlers, the deer seemed poised to turn once more.
 </p>
 <p>
  Stepping inward, I struck the deer’s cheek with my shield as it spun, then forcefully dislodged the sword hilt firmly embedded in its haunch.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kii!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A fresh cry resounded through the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  Excellent, the sword remained intact. I immediately relinquished the shield, tightening my grip around the sword hilt. Though tightly wedged between the deer’s leather hide and muscles, I managed to extract the blade.

 <p>
  I reinserted the blade into the same wound.
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, deeper.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  I swiftly retreated, creating a substantial distance. The deer’s antlers tore through my garments, leaving them in tatters.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once again, I charged forward, wielding the sword hilt. Crimson blood sprayed forth, marking a newly inflicted wound. The severed tissues allowed blood-stained sword to tumble from the expanding gash. I snatched it from the air and quickly distanced myself from the thrashing deer.
 </p>
 <p>
  Agonized, the deer thrashed about, leaping in all directions, its antlers swinging wildly. Branches and rocks ensnared within its antlers shattered into fragments.
 </p>
 <p>
  I stepped back a few paces to behold the spectacle before me.
 </p>
 <p>
  And just as it presented an opening…
 </p>
 <p>
  I dashed forward and drove the sword into its temple. With the blade piercing through the skull, no monstrous entity could survive such a strike. The Forest Queen’s eyes lost their luster, and her body slumped to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Phew.”
 </p>

 <p>
  I wiped the sweat off my forehead and gave my left arm a single rotation. It was a bit stiff, but I could still move it. Thankfully, it didn’t seem dislocated.
 </p>
 <p>
  I wiped the blood off the sword, retrieved my shield, and surveyed the fallen queen’s remains.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking at her now, it was hard to believe she was once a deer. She resembled more of a mythical creature, perhaps even a bull. Only one leg remained intact.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, what should I do next?
 </p>
 <p>
  My priority was to find the elemental stone.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But where could it be?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I had expected the corpse to vanish, leaving behind an item. However, my anticipation proved futile. Just as I pondered whether to call Jenna, the deer dropped something from its mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a sleek, green bead.

  [An elemental stone infused with the essence of the forest. Used for crafting various items and empowering certain heroes.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Bingo.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had found the elemental stone.
 </p>
 <p>
  Next, I needed to locate valuable components from the Forest Queen.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Her blood and scales.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Both were crucial ingredients for crafting superior items.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, I lacked the necessary tools to extract them. I attempted to push a blade against the antlers, but it barely left a scratch. They seemed tougher than steel. Bringing a saw wouldn’t do the trick either.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I guess I’ll have to take some blood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After making several incisions with the blade, I finally managed to sever the carotid artery.
 </p>
 <p>
  I pressed the back of the shield beneath the bleeding neck. With no means of taking it with me, I had no other choice. The blood began to collect on the shield.

 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I crouched down, observing the blood as it flowed from the neck.
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching it silently became exasperating.
 </p>
 <p>
  I rose to my feet, firmly gripping the sword. My focus now shifted to the deer’s antlers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Initially, I had contemplated discarding them, but my thoughts had changed. There was no telling when I would have another chance to obtain them.
 </p>
 <p>
  I relaxed my body, honing my concentration. With both hands clutching the sword hilt, I prepared for a decisive strike.
 </p>
 <p>
  I swung the sword down with force.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Unbelievable.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sparks erupted from the point of impact between the sword and antlers.
 </p>

 <p>
  Beyond mere disbelief, I was left dumbfounded. It felt as if I were cutting through steel. It wasn’t merely shattering the tree like brittle timber.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ultimately, there remained only one option.

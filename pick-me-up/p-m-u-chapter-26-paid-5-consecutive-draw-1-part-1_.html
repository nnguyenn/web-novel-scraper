 <p>
  [Drag and drop your heroes!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “‘Dica (★)’ has joined ‘Party 1’!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dica had become a member of our main party.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please take care of me!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dica nodded to me with a determined expression on her face.
 </p>
 <p>
  After the tragic deaths of Zeeth and Hanson, he displayed a somber demeanor for a while. However, it seemed he had managed to recover in some way. Recently, he had been joining me and Aaron in our training sessions.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sky shimmered brightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  It meant that the master had logged in.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems that it won’t be just a Weekly Dungeon today, huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron adjusted his spear nervously.
 </p>
 <p>
  The members Iselle called upon were me, Jenna, Aaron, and Dica. We were the core fighting party in the current waiting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to me, Dica was significantly weaker, but he outperformed the other members. Most of them were still on the 1st floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  When venturing into the Weekly Dungeon, we were dispatched with the sub-members, so these folks could understand the master’s intentions.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Open, Rift of time and space!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The central door of the plaza swung open.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our party’s faces tensed up. Even Jenna, who usually maintained composure, had a rigid expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why are you so nervous?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The 5th floor was incredibly challenging. I thought I was going to die.”
 </p>

 <p>
  Aaron let out a sigh.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry. It won’t be as tough this time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Really?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Yes, absolutely.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There seems to be some room for doubt in your answer!”
 </p>
 <p>
  While there is always a slim chance of encountering a high-difficulty mission in the sub-stage, I couldn’t be completely sure. That was the rule of Pick Me Up.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took a step forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before long, three others followed suit.
 </p>
 <p>
  We couldn’t fill the required party slots, but it didn’t matter.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took a light deep breath.

  [Climb the Tower, Save the World!]
  <br/>
  [Main Dungeon: Current Floor – 5]
 </p>
 <p>
  The left mirror in the Rift of the Dimension began to radiate light.
 </p>
 <p>
  It signaled our entry into the main dungeon. The tension returned to my party members’ faces, particularly Dica, who trembled while tightly gripping his sword and shield.
 </p>
 <p>
  We didn’t tell him how Zeeth and Hanson had met their end.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon, the light vanished, and we found ourselves in an unfamiliar location.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Floor 6.]
  <br/>
  [Mission Type – Exploration]
  <br/>
  [Objective – Explore the Unknown Location!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “The field is a forest.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Exploration, huh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Another rare mission had appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took a moment to assess the surroundings.
 </p>

 <p>
  No enemies were in sight. Only a vast field of swaying grass stretched out before us.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Um, hyung. I don’t see any enemies. Could this be another situation like the 5th floor…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron became as silent as a statue and nodded in agreement.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t raise your voices. Everyone, lower your heads and bow down.”
 </p>
 <p>
  They immediately lie down flat on the ground like soldiers.
 </p>
 <p>
  “….”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I said lower your heads, not lie down on the ground.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The party members stood up, slightly bewildered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s nothing major here, so relax. As long as we fulfill the conditions, we can make it through safely.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait a moment. I’ll be back soon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After concealing the three of them amidst the field, I quietly slipped away to the side of the road.
 </p>
 <p>
  As I advanced, I sensed an obstacle ahead. It seemed impassable.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a linear-shaped map.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If we followed the path that cut through the center of the field, we might reach an event point. When I returned, I directed the party to venture in the opposite direction.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are we sneaking somewhere?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna asked, plucking a stray leaf from her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  We proceeded, carefully hiding our bodies within the dense foliage of the grassy forest.
 </p>
 <p>
  With her keen eyesight, Jenna took the lead, and I followed closely behind.
 </p>

  “It feels familiar.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m not usually fond of these kinds of situations.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Muttering to herself, Jenna skillfully navigated through the verdant undergrowth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before long, our attention was captured by the appearance of enemies.
 </p>
 <p>
  Three goblins stood nonchalantly on the path, forming a loose formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ker, Kyarak!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kira, Kiraroro!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The goblins engaged in animated chatter among themselves.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are they saying?”
 </p>
 <p>
  These goblins were unlike any we had encountered before.
 </p>

 <p>
  Their scrawny arms now boasted sinewy muscles and their physique had grown more formidable. Their shoddy attire, once barely covering them, had undergone a transformation. They sported crude leather armor and wielded swords and shields.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Goblin Lv.8 X 3]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do we take them down, hyung?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron tightened his grip on his spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I examined the goblins’ appearance once again.
 </p>
 <p>
  A small horn whistle dangled from the leather belt around their waists.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pointing towards a tree beside the dense grass, I instructed:
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jenna, do you see that tree?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, I do.”
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-12" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  “Climb to the top and see what’s up there.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna swiftly ascended the tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  After a brief moment, Jenna returned with valuable information.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I think there’s a goblin lair. There’s a structure within the barrier, and it seems to be teeming with them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How many are there?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s hard to say. Maybe around a hundred?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I grasped the situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed to be a trap-like pattern.
 </p>
 <p>
  Inexperienced heroes would encounter the goblins while following the path and immediately engage in combat. That had been the recurring theme in the previous stages.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jenna, target the goblin on the far right when I give the signal.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aaron, when I lure them, thrust your spear into the head of that one.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “As for you…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dica gazed at me with hopeful eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If anything unexpected happens, lend us your assistance.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes…”
 </p>
 <p>
  There was nothing else to assign.
 </p>
 <p>
  Besides, exploration hardly yielded any significant experience points.
 </p>
 <p>
  I lay flat on the ground, plucking a small pebble rolling amidst the tall grass.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-14" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  Thunk.
 </p>
 <p>
  The pebble hit the back of a motionless goblin.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The struck goblin turned towards the direction of the grass, wearing a perplexed expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  Tap, tap.
 </p>
 <p>
  I lightly tapped the ground with the hilt of my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  The goblin, detecting the sound, ventured closer. As the familiar odor of the goblin wafted towards my nose.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna’s arrow pierced through the forehead of the rightmost goblin.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron’s spear impaled the face of the goblin protruding from the foliage.
 </p>

 <p>
  The remaining goblin let out a terrified shriek and pulled out a horn whistle.
 </p>
 <p>
  Emerging from the tall grass, I sprinted forward and delivered a forceful blow to the goblin’s face with my shield. Despite losing a broken tooth, the goblin desperately clung to the horn whistle, attempting to blow it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Pff…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I swiftly kicked the horn whistle aside and thrust my sword into the left side of its chest. The goblin crumpled without even having the chance to scream.
 </p>
 <p>
  As I withdrew the sword, sticky blood clung to its blade.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I-Is it over?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dica emerged from the grass.
 </p>
 <p>
  His face displayed a mixture of surprise and relief.
 </p>
 <p>
  “For now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I replied and wiped the blood off the blade.
 </p>
 <p>
  All three goblins had transformed into lifeless bodies. None of them had succeeded in blowing the horn whistle. I nudged the shattered horn whistle on the ground with my foot and spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If we let that whistle sound, reinforcements will come pouring out of the stronghold, making things quite troublesome.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Rushing in without knowing it’s an extermination mission would trigger the trap.
 </p>
 <p>
  A message appeared, indicating the completion of the mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stage Clear!]

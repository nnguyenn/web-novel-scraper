 <p>
  The following day arrived.
 </p>
 <p>
  After diligently clearing the weekly dungeon, Anytng led party 2, with Edis at the helm, to the 4th floor. However, when we attempted to venture to the 6th floor as our trio, the dungeon refused to open its doors.

 <p>
  [Warning! Re-entry to this dungeon is prohibited.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I warned you not to lose focus ‘master’.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Once the stream is initiated, re-entering the affiliated dungeon becomes an impossibility. It might be achievable with specialized skills, but given the circumstances, it was simply unattainable.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna scratched the back of her head, voicing her frustration.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why aren’t the master giving us any instructions?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just be patient.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After pondering for a brief moment, Anytng reached a decision.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Main dungeon, the current challenge lies on the 7th floor.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The door will open in 10 seconds. Prepare yourselves!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s the 7th floor. Get ready.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Brother, we have fewer members in our party…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We have enough.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Reentering the 4th floor has become useless due to our higher levels, resulting in diminished experience gains.
 </p>
 <p>
  The 5th floor is off-limits, and re-entering the boss stage is likewise an impossibility.
 </p>
 <p>
  The path to the 6th floor is obstructed, leaving us with only two options from the Master: either return us to the plaza or undertake the challenge on the 7th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  I yearned to put my skill, Frenzy, to the test, and luckily, an appropriate stage presented itself. A radiant light enveloped the fabric of space-time, and we found ourselves transported to an unfamiliar realm.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The field appears to be plain, but there’s something peculiar about it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pitter-patter.

 <p>
  Within this vast expanse, heavy raindrops descended, drenching us without mercy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna, shivering, couldn’t help but complain.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What on earth is this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s quite refreshing, isn’t it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Drawing my sword from its sheath, I marveled at the way the raindrops scattered along the path of my blade.
 </p>
 <p>
  And there they stood, our opponents.
 </p>

 <p>
  Through the torrential rain, their crimson eyes gleamed with malevolence.
 </p>
 <p>
  Large goblins, donning armor and wielding weapons, bellowed with fury. Aaron confidently brandished his spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank goodness, hyung-nim! We can handle this challenge!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swiftly, we formed our battle formation. Our party consisted of three members: a swordsman, a spearman, and an archer. The composition was perfectly suited for maintaining balance in combat. We had practiced formations to the point of tedium.
 </p>
 <p>
  I positioned myself at the forefront, with Aaron in the middle rank, and Jenna, the skilled archer, taking her place in the rear.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kiyaaa!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The goblins, too, assumed their designated positions, strategically dividing themselves between the front and the back, depending on the weapons they wielded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Within the deluge of rainfall, both our party and the enemy split into two factions.
 </p>
 <p>
  No words were necessary. The combat ignited with a flurry of arrows from both sides, signaling the beginning of the battle. I used my shield to deflect bolts heading towards Jenna. Lowering herself to the ground, Jenna let loose a volley of arrows.
 </p>
 <p>
  Direct frontal attacks were risky against enemies armed with shields, so she aimed for the lower parts. One of Jenna’s arrows pierced through the leg of the leading goblin.

 <p>
  Seizing the momentary distraction, my sword and Aaron’s spear claimed lives.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Unleash it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As I struck a goblin’s face, exposing its menacing fangs, memories of a similar sensation surged through me.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★)’ has entered a frenzy state!]
 </p>
 <p>
  My sword shattered the goblin’s shield, cleaving the creature in half from head to midsection. A spray of blood mixed with rain dispersed in all directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Slaughter and carnage ensued.
 </p>
 <p>
  A wave of exhilaration washed over me. With each swing of my sword, goblins were torn asunder. The metallic taste of blood filled my mouth. The rain, seeping through gaps in my armor, failed to quench my body’s heat.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before I knew it, I stood amidst a pile of goblin corpses.
 </p>
 <p>
  Only one foe remained—a solitary figure brandishing a broken sword. Jenna took aim with her bow.
 </p>
 <p>
  I raised my hand, motioning for Jenna to hold her fire.

  “Hold on, don’t shoot!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why? I’m drenched, and I want to wrap this up quickly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The battle neared its end.
 </p>
 <p>
  If that was the case, it was the perfect time to assess this stage. Considering the previous mission was an exploration, there was a high chance that this mission was part of a linked quest. I surveyed our surroundings.
 </p>
 <p>
  First notable detail.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rain continued to pour relentlessly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Second detail.
 </p>
 <p>
  A river flowed nearby.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kiaaak!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A goblin, wielding a broken sword, swung it vigorously, charging towards me. I swiftly struck the creature’s cheek with my shield.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Kyaaang!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Moving past the fallen goblin, I approached the riverbank.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  The river, cutting through the plain, surged and overflowed due to the incessant downpour. Crossing it seemed impossible. Even a slight misstep would sweep me away in an instant, leading to a watery demise.
 </p>
 <p>
  I edged closer to the riverbank, my curiosity piqued.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Has the dam collapsed?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I spotted the scattered remnants of rocks and soil near the water’s edge. A quick scan of the surroundings revealed nothing particularly eye-catching. With precision, I thrust my sword into the fallen goblin’s back, delivering the final blow.
 </p>
 <p>
  As I finished off the enemy, a subtle rumbling sensation reverberated through the ground, causing it to tremble ever so slightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stage clear!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Aaron (★)’ has leveled up!]

 </p>
 <p>
  We returned through the rift of space and time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our soaked bodies seemed to be recognized as objects in need of restoration, as the rain had all but evaporated. Jenna squinted her eyes and ran her fingers through her red hair.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once the tremors signaling our ascent to the next floor ceased, we emerged into the bustling plaza.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the heart of the plaza, Edis huddled with the party members near the fountain, engaged in earnest conversation. It seemed they were analyzing their previous battle. Jenna waved her hand enthusiastically.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sister!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, you all made it too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oppa, is today’s schedule complete? Can I go now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Feel free to go.”

 <p>
  “Yay!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned to Aaron and inquired.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What about you? It’s getting late.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I plan on heading to the training grounds.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Take it easy. Don’t overexert yourself.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I strolled towards our lodging. There was no need to linger around unnecessarily. Just as we did on the 6th floor, it was crucial to document the information we had gathered this time. Preparing for battles didn’t solely entail relentless training.
 </p>
 <p>
  Through the plaza’s entrance, I entered our comfortable abode.
 </p>
 <p>
  Casting a fleeting glance backward, I noticed that the door to the summoning portal remained ajar.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I stepped back outside. Aaron had already readied his spear, poised to depart for the training grounds.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aaron, hold on, don’t go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes? What’s the matter?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I gazed upwards, captivated by the dazzling radiance that bathed the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before long, a control panel materialized in my mind’s eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you have any desires at this moment, make your payment promptly!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Moebus supports the Master’s choice!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You have selected the ‘Newbie Potent Double Package!'”

  I quickly looked around.
 </p>
 <p>
  And there she was, Jenna appeared to be engrossed in a conversation with Edis.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, you know, when oppa is asleep, he talks in his sleep and…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jenna!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh? You’re still here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Forget the nonsense. Bring me that thing from my room. It should be on the table in my room. The one we drew last time.”

 <p>
  “I think we’re getting new recruits. People like you.”

  ‘I thought we might recruit some new members.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With parties of three, it was only natural that we needed to fill the vacancies.
 </p>

 <p>
  However, in our current state, there weren’t any suitable candidates to join our party. While some individuals in the training grounds showed potential, they needed time to grow.
 </p>
 <p>
  In that case, recruiting was inevitable.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Even though there are people who never made any purchases, there isn’t a single person who has only made one purchase.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled, recalling a well-known saying widely shared on the official forum. Anytng must have also learned a lesson from the previous incident.
 </p>
 <p>
  One shouldn’t recklessly indulge in paid summons.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although it may be partly my fault.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nevertheless, there were principles and methods even when it came to paid summons. If you mindlessly summon excessively just because you have an abundance of gems, you’ll incur 100% losses.
 </p>
 <p>
  In Pick Me Up, it was crucial not to forget that each hero had unique characteristics and individuality.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Take it slow. And step by step.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, advanced summoning begins! You have selected 2 consecutive advanced summons. A total of 1,000 gems will be consumed. Do you wish to summon?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes (Select) / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  With two people, Edis and I could each have one.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like he finally grasped the efficient method of summoning.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, advanced summoning begins. I’m excited to see which heroes will appear!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Thump, thump, thump]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Clang!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Rare!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master ‘Anytng’ has acquired the hero ‘Roderek (★★★)’!”

  [Rare!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master ‘Anytng’ has acquired the hero ‘Eolka (★★★)’!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A brilliant light emanated from the summoning portal.
 </p>
 <p>
  The gaze of me and my companions converged on the entrance.
 </p>
 <p>
  After a while, a man and a woman emerged, one from each side of the summoning portal.
 </p>
 <p>
  The man wore chain armor, with a spear strapped to his back, while the young woman wore an exquisite dress.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Why is she dressed like that?’
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are your names?” the man in armor asked, glancing at us.
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t help but notice the middle-aged man’s sturdy build beneath the armor, his hair silvered by age.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That can wait. Do you remember why you’re here?” I inquired, hoping to jog his memory.
 </p>

 <p>
  He furrowed his brows, lost in deep thought. The woman beside him seemed equally perplexed, her head tilted with confusion as she stood at the threshold of the summoning portal.
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, the summoning portal abruptly closed, knocking the woman off balance.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh my!”
 </p>
 <p>
  She exclaimed, tumbling to the ground in surprise.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the same time, Jenna made it to the square, “Oppa, I brought you the lot… Huh? New people have arrived. What are the names of the two of you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Roderick Sazan,” the man in armor introduced himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  “And what is that sister doing lying down like that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mind your own business. I’m sure she’ll get up on her own,” I replied, brushing off her concern.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m going to ask again what are your names?” the old man inquired.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I am Han, and this is Edis and Jenna.” I introduced us.
 </p>

  Turning to Roderick, I inquired about how he ended up here. As I expected, he couldn’t recall the details. He mentioned serving as a guard in a city and then finding himself in this unfamiliar place, accompanied by a persistent sense of duty.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It feels like there’s something I must do. Almost like being in a trance,” he explained.
 </p>
 <p>
  Roderick was aware of the core concepts including Master, Summoning, and Synthesis. However, he did not know concepts such as levels and skills. It was the same with Edith. At this point, the characteristics of three-star heroes were established. I didn’t even need to ask that woman.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, we have to face unknown enemies here?” Roderick summarized, seeking confirmation.
 </p>
 <p>
  I nodded, affirming his understanding.
 </p>
 <p>
  Roderick let out a disheartened sigh.
 </p>
 <p>
  The remaining woman lay on the ground, unable to rise.
 </p>
 <p>
  Could it be a disappointment?
 </p>
 <p>
  There are rare instances when a high-ranking hero is summoned but fails to live up to their potential. It’s like being cursed with unfortunate luck.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron, in his unassuming manner, approached the woman and helped her to her feet.

  She stumbled, her head spinning.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you. I feel a bit dizzy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s nothing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “She’s of noble birth.” Edis whispered, her voice intended for me alone.
 </p>
 <p>
  “A noble?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’d know if you’ve spent enough time as a mercenary. She seems inexperienced, like an innocent young lady. How did she end up here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Now that I think about it, except for me, everyone else is from Townia.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Regardless, it was time for the draft. The master also seemed aware, as he hadn’t assigned the two of them to a party yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We have two lots. If you draw the red one, take the gentleman. If you draw the blue one, take the woman. Any objections?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “None.”
 </p>

  “Jenna, bring the lots over here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, sir. Oops.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna tripped over a protrusion in the square. Swiftly, she rolled her foot and regained her balance. In the process, the container of lots she held shook up and down.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The right one is red. The left one is blue.’
 </p>
 <p>
  While I could check their status windows, I didn’t want to resort to cheating even in a place like this. Even without looking, it was clear whom I should choose. A seasoned guard with a wealth of experience and an inexperienced noblewoman.
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis, too, had her gaze fixed on the right swallow. She had deciphered the order, just like me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well then, here we go!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna placed the container between me and Edis.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if our current sub-abilities were inferior, we wouldn’t hold back.
 </p>
 <p>
  I chose the right one.
 </p>

 <p>
  Having Roderick, who wielded a spear, in our party would fortify the middle line.
 </p>
 <p>
  And at that moment…
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flames erupted from the woman’s hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘She’s a mage!’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Left!’
 </p>
 <p>
  As lightning-quick as our hands moved towards the left lot, they converged.

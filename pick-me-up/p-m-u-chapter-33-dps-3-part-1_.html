 <p>
  “Key!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Goblin riders zoomed past us on their wolves, kicking up a swirling cloud of dust that briefly concealed their presence.
 </p>

 <p>
  There were approximately 27 of them.
 </p>
 <p>
  When you count the goblins and the wolves separately, the total comes to 54.
 </p>
 <p>
  The goblins, clad in sturdy iron armor, brandished crossbows and blades, while the wolves were massive creatures, almost resembling horses.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Looks like we’ve got some troublemakers on our hands.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Dealing with just one or two wouldn’t be an issue, but facing nearly 30 of them was akin to a full-fledged cavalry charge.
 </p>
 <p>
  The goblin riders, who had been thundering by, abruptly changed course and charged directly towards us.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What should we do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Simple! Take ’em down!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Quick as a flash, Jenna notched an arrow and let it fly.
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the leading goblins toppled from its wolf companion, crashing to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of all the places, it had to be an open plain.
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t help but frown. We were left completely exposed to the stampeding onslaught of the twenty goblin riders. Dust billowed around them as they raced forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Krrrr!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Keeeyaaa!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The wails of the wolves mingled with the goblins’ cries, creating a dissonant symphony.
 </p>
 <p>
  We’ll need a different approach here, something unlike our usual tactics.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aaron, when you come face to face with them, sidestep and strike. Can you handle it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll give it my best shot!”
 </p>

 <p>
  “As for you…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned my gaze towards Eolka.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll deal with you later!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, a bolt whizzed through the air, aimed directly at my forehead. Swiftly, I deflected it with my shield and spun around, unleashing a sweeping arc with my sword. The foremost goblin’s upper body twisted grotesquely as it was severed from its lower half. Rolling swiftly to the ground, I evaded the charging path just in time.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the goblins raced past me, their blades swung perilously close. I parried with my shield, retreating a few steps.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aaron!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ready!”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a piercing thrust, Aaron impaled a goblin with his spear, piercing its chestplate. At that very moment, a bolt flew towards the defenseless Aaron. Reacting swiftly, I cleaved it in half with my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna’s well-aimed arrow sent another goblin tumbling to the ground, lying motionless.
 </p>
 <p>
  Using my shield, I deflected a bolt hurtling towards Jenna and spoke urgently.

 <p>
  “Eolka! Cast your magic.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Magic?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t make me repeat myself! Aren’t you a magician? Wipe them all out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I need some time!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How long?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “One minute!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The goblins launched a second charge. This time, a ferocious wolf lunged for my face. Reacting swiftly, I dropped to the ground, thrusting my sword into its gaping maw.
 </p>
 <p>
  With lightning reflexes, I rolled once more, narrowly avoiding the trampling fury.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Cast it now!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eolka frantically shook her head, her eyes closing.
 </p>

 <p>
  【La Gran Cedus.】
 </p>
 <p>
  A deep, resonant low note flowed from Eolka’s lips as if it were expanding through the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  A single thread of fire ignited beneath Eolka’s feet, steadily growing thicker and twisting upward like a coiling serpent, enveloping her entire body.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is… magic.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The warmth radiating from Eolka’s figure tickled my cheeks, a tangible testament to the power surging within her.
 </p>
 <p>
  Given our limited range and maneuverability, Aaron and I lacked the means to launch a preemptive strike. It was up to Jenna, the skilled archer, and Eolka, the proficient mage, to make their mark.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aaron, shield Jenna from incoming bolts. Let her focus on her shots.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, sir!”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a swift motion, Aaron deflected the bolts with his spear. In the meantime, Jenna’s arrow pierced through one of the goblins, finding its mark.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just one minute. Time is running short.”
 </p>

 <p>
  We had to endure until the enemy passed us by and circled back, a process that would take at least 30 seconds.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kia, Kiaaa!”
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the goblin riders realized the unfolding spell and rallied the others, charging recklessly towards Eolka. Stepping forward, I positioned myself in front of her, intercepting their path and cleaving through their ranks with my blade.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mages, whether allies or adversaries, were always the primary targets for elimination. I could buy us some time, but completely halting the charge of 30 goblin riders was an impossible feat for me alone.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can’t you make a shield while casting?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Mages, during their incantations, typically fortified themselves with an additional barrier to withstand any interruptions or impact.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can’t you answer?”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Or perhaps she can’t hear me?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I turned my gaze back, catching sight of Eolka’s unceasing muttering, her eyes flickering with a fiery glow.
 </p>
 <p>
  It would take approximately 10 seconds for the riders to reach us. Despite Jenna’s expert marksmanship, bringing down another goblin mid-charge, their momentum showed no sign of faltering. The goblins swung their swords overhead, forcefully kicking their wolves with their hind legs.
 </p>

  “If you remain there, you’ll be swept away by their charge!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can’t you cast your magic while on the move?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oppa! It’s getting too risky!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uwagh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Acting swiftly, I grasped Eolka’s arm and rolled to the side, narrowly evading the swinging blade that passed perilously close. A scorching heat tingled through my limbs, evidence of the searing flames that had nearly caught us.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What… What are you doing?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re quite the nuisance, aren’t you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  If there had been a shield barrier, I wouldn’t have been able to reach out and grab Eolka’s hand. In the end, she was casting her spell completely exposed, without any protective measures.
 </p>
 <p>
  “A nuisance, you say? Well, this magic, do you know difficult it’s to convert mana into fire!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Enough.”
 </p>

 <p>
  I clenched and unclenched my hands, the lingering warmth of the flames still tingling through my fingertips. It was uncomfortable, but I could still move.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having completed their third charge, the goblin riders now aimed for a fourth, hurtling towards us with one goal in mind—Eolka.
 </p>
 <p>
  If their target had been me, Aaron, or even Jenna, we could have lured them in, evaded their charge, and launched a counteroffensive, wiping them out. But Eolka was different. With her clumsy attire and lacking both stamina and agility, there was a real risk of her being swept away and killed in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, if I could come up with a plan, I could use Eolka as a decoy and eliminate the enemies.
 </p>
 <p>
  I scanned our surroundings once more.

 <p>
  That very night, I summoned my party members to the lobby.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna, Aaron, and I gathered together, ready for discussion. Eolka, however, remained in her room, recovering from the effects of dehydration incurred during training. Since the upcoming conversation pertained to the three of us, Eolka’s absence did not pose an issue.

 <p>
  I placed the prepared stove in the center of the lobby.
 </p>
 <p>
  Within the stove, flames flickered and danced, radiating warmth. I addressed my companions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We have officially welcomed a magician into our party.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, that’s to be expected. It goes without saying,” Jenna replied.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now, our responsibilities will shift accordingly. Do you understand the significance of me bringing this stove here?” I asked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m not entirely sure,” she responded uncertainly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Observe closely,” I declared, raising my right hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  A surge of doubt washed over me.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is utter madness.
 </p>
 <p>
  What a reckless endeavor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Suppressing the rising tide of negative thoughts, I refocused my mind. It had to be done—for the sake of necessity and progress. Taking a deep breath, I plunged my right hand into the heart of the roaring flames.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, Hyung! What are you doing?” Aaron cried out.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aaron, what’s happening?” Jenna asked, her voice filled with concern.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If Eolka is an expert at using fire magic… then we must become immune to it,” I explained.
 </p>
 <p>
  My vision blurred as pain enveloped my hand. I clutched my right hand with my left, desperately enduring the searing heat. Despite my efforts, blisters formed, and the pain intensified.
 </p>
 <p>
  After counting to ten, I withdrew my hand from the scorching blaze.
 </p>
 <p>
  My right hand displayed a fiery red hue, but as fresh skin gradually appeared, the pain began to subside.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Eolka isn’t the only one who will harness the power of fire. We will fight alongside her. If we don’t grow immune to the flames, we will become toasted before our enemies,” I stated firmly.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Are you suggesting we should do something like this?” Jenna’s eyes widened in fear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron closed his eyes momentarily, then spoke with curiosity, “How many times do we have to do this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We must persist until we develop resistance,” I replied, hinting at acquiring the Flame Resistance skill.
 </p>
 <p>
  While it was possible to create accessories imbued with Flame Resistance, it necessitated a plentiful supply of materials and proper facilities. Nonetheless, acquiring elemental resistance proved advantageous, not just for Eolka but for the entire party.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Remember the fifth floor. We can’t afford to let our guard down again,” I warned Aaron, his gaze fixed upon the stove. He raised his right hand, preparing to plunge it into the flames, but I interjected.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do it where I can’t see. I have no desire to witness your suffering. My actions were merely meant as an example,” I clarified.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I understand,” he acknowledged, accepting my guidance.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How about you?” I looked at Jenna.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I… I’m not sure if I can,” Jenna hesitated.
 </p>
 <p>
  “In that case, allow me to bear the burden with you. If we hold hands and face this challenge together, the flames won’t feel as scorching,” I reassured.

 <p>
  “That… that’s not necessary!” Jenna blurted out, her face flushed with embarrassment.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you going to keep running away whenever Eolka uses magic? She can’t create shields or use teleportation spells. If we can’t keep her protected by our side, she’ll be defenseless.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We don’t have any other choice.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna’s gaze lowered slowly, and with uncertain words, she nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sighed deeply, then said,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Next.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do we have another task?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aaron, I’m sorry to ask, but there’s one more thing you need to do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay.”
 </p>

 <p>
  I reached out my right hand towards the ground. From Jenna’s waist, I drew a dagger and placed it on my upturned palm.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s this for?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Pain Resistance.”
 </p>
 <p>
  My hand tingled uncomfortably, but I managed to speak.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I won’t force you to do it this way. Find your own method. It’s about building your resilience to pain.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I slowly withdrew the dagger with my left hand. The wound healed quickly. Clenching my right hand, blood staining my palm, I looked at Aaron. Sweat drips formed on his forehead.
 </p>
 <p>
  He must be feeling terrible. I felt the same. I knew it was necessary, but personally going through with it felt maddening. Yet, it was necessary. While Health Potions could heal wounds, they came with intense pain. To endure and fight, Pain Resistance was an essential skill.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do I also need to…” Jenna looked terrified.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You don’t.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Phew.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “But it’s something you’ll have to face eventually.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please, let it be later, much later.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay, but you need to do something else. After practicing with the dagger, you become a switcher.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A switcher?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, it means you can use both a bow and a dagger. Make it possible for you to switch between the two weapons quickly. You must be able to fight at both close and long-range, wherever and whenever.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But I prefer using the bow.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “From now on, things will be different. It may not be your natural preference, but there will be times when the two of us won’t be able to protect Eolka. At those times, you’ll need to take on an additional defensive role.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It felt like protecting a true princess.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, to truly harness Eolka’s potential, there’s no other choice.
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering the formidable firepower we witnessed on the 8th floor, its versatility will surely come into play.
 </p>

 <p>
  “From now on we’ll form a triangular formation centered around Eolka. We’ll commence training from tomorrow.”
 </p>
 <p>
  We have a colossal cannon on our side.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, this cannon lacks any defensive mechanisms. Therefore, our only option is to position it along external defense forces. Thus, we create a single tank equipped with turrets and armor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Eolka’s endurance may be lacking, we can compensate for it by reducing firepower and utilizing mana potions. After all, the effectiveness of any weapon ultimately depends on how it’s wielded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If only we had one more support-type magician.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In that case, the Double Magician system would be complete. It was widely acknowledged as one of the most efficient party compositions in Pick Me Up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anyway, the next challenge awaits on the 10th floor. If we want to survive, we must put these tasks into action.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  While the 9th floor still remains, our chances of venturing there are slim.
 </p>

 <p>
  To gain experience in climbing the tower, two parties will embark on the 9th floor. Given the collaborative quest, having a single party is insufficient. This knowledge is practically common among players, and Anytng is likely aware of it too. After the 10th floor, missions will require cooperation between two or more parties.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hints have been provided during this stream, and we might end up with one on the 10th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Subjugation. Survival. Escort. Breakthrough. Assassination. Defense. Siege. Pursuit. Escape.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I compared the multitude of mission types with the information I’ve gathered. Although I had some speculations, reaching a definite conclusion proved elusive.
 </p>
 <p>
  Action can only be taken once we’re in the midst of the actual mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our work is far from finished.
 </p>
 <p>
  Returning to the room, I set about creating a detailed plan.

 <p>
  Aaron’s mouth gaped in astonishment.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What the heck is that?”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Never seen a monster before?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Truth be told, this was my first too.
 </p>
 <p>
  I drew my blade across my shield, and the piercing sound of metal split the silence.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t be afraid, everyone! It’s just a beast, like us, it has a brain and a heart. If it has a heart it means it can die. Keep thrusting your weapons, and it’ll fall.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, it’s better than facing a swarm of goblins!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ping!
 </p>
 <p>
  In a swift, graceful motion, Jenna said then released an arrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  Twirling through the air, it found its mark deep within the ogre’s belly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kuaaah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The ogre roared, drool flying from its mouth, yet it continued its approach steadily. Each heavy footstep disturbed the earth beneath.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna, smiling, scratched her cheek nonchalantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Or perhaps, facing goblins is better?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll find out once this one’s down.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I cast a glance over my shoulder.
 </p>
 <p>
  My party was tense with uncertainty, yet their faces betrayed no fear.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was promising. If each held their ground, victory was within our grasp.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Get hold of yourselves! We’re splitting responsibilities. Eolka, you’re to create a wall of fire near the dam.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A wall of fire?”
 </p>

  “To bar the goblins from advancing until backup arrives.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can manage that, but what about that monster?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll handle it. Aaron, your job is to shield Eolka. Jenna, depending on how things unfold, assists either Aaron or me. Trust your judgment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Everyone, to your positions.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Eolka sprinted toward the riverbank opposite the dam, she started her spell casting.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron followed in a swift stride, warding off any projectiles aimed at Eolka.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna, entrusted with the center position, observed the unfolding scenario, her arrow poised to strike.
 </p>
 <p>
  I hurled a stone from the riverbank straight at the ogre’s grim face.

 <p>
  The ogre scowled at the unpleasant surprise and advanced towards me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I readied myself, drawing my sword and raising my shield.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kuoouoouoo!”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a deafening shriek, the ogre swung its formidable iron hammer.
 </p>
 <p>
  I nimbly rolled aside to evade. The ground trembled under the mighty force of the hammer, flinging dirt and mud high into the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘One hit could spell the end.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A shield is only as good as its ability to withstand the force it’s meant to deflect.
 </p>
 <p>
  I vaulted backwards, deftly avoiding the erratic arc of the plummeting hammer.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ping!
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna’s second arrow pierced the ogre’s right shoulder.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Kiaaaa!”
 </p>
 <p>
  At the same time, Goblins began to surge towards the dam in a frenzied rush.
 </p>
 <p>
  【Ignite!】
 </p>
 <p>
  Whooosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Fire seared a path between the goblins and the riverbank. The flame’s menacing wall caused the goblins to falter momentarily, a pause Aaron seized to spear through a goblin’s skull with deadly precision.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eolka, her eyes closed, continued to recite her spell unyieldingly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her purpose wasn’t to shoot fire, but to sustain it. Even in the relentless rain, the flames roared upward, their fury undiminished.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ogre, after retrieving its iron hammer, nonchalantly shrugged its shoulders. An arrow lodged in its muscular crevice slipped out smoothly. Jenna, who was readying her third arrow, grumbled a curse under her breath.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What a beast!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aim for vital spots, or don’t bother. We can’t waste arrows.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “And where the hell are these vital spots?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s for you to figure out!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  As if about to leap in, I rolled forward. The place where I once stood was demolished by the iron hammer. I sprang to my feet and swung my sword in a wide arc, causing a spray of blood from the ogre’s right arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ogre, unaffected, swept its hammer sideways. I evaded narrowly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Cutting deep is tough without a proper stance.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I snuck a glance sideways.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron was giving his all, yet there was no assurance of how long he could shield Eolka. The goblins, having assessed the situation, had shifted from close-combat to long-range attacks. They fired bolts; the ones without crossbows resorted to hurling stones. Whether bolt or stone, a single hit could disrupt Eolka’s balance.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I must take the risk.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The ogre upheaved its hammer and thundered it down.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  I semi-bent my knee and moved in closer to the ogre. As the hammer’s tail end threatened to shatter my skull, I yanked my left hand back, lifting my shield in a deflective block.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ka-ka-kak!
 </p>
 <p>
  A bone-warping shockwave rattled my left hand. I shrugged off the pain and, with a slippery move, slid under the ogre’s feet and tightened my grip on the sword hilt.
 </p>
 <p>
  With my right hand, I drove the sword tip into the ogre’s groin with all my might.
 </p>
 <p>
  A sensation of crumbling filled my hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Ow, so he’s a male.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Blood gushed between its legs as I yanked out the sword and swiftly wriggled free.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kuoooooo!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The ogre howled, brandishing its hammer aimlessly in an unhinged frenzy, a desperate act to override its agony.
 </p>
 <p>
  I established a safe distance between myself and the gigantic beast, ensuring I was just a few meters away.
 </p>

 <p>
  An agonizing sting surged from the deep recesses of my left arm, the sensation akin to a broken bone. Still, it wasn’t incapacitated, and with some effort, remained functional.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kuoo, Kaaaa!” roared the ogre, slamming its iron hammer down with brute force, painting a gruesome picture as a handful of goblins were crushed into a bloody pulp.
 </p>
 <p>
  In an electrifying moment, an arrow from Jenna’s quiver found its mark, piercing the ogre’s left eye with deadly precision.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ogre lost control, dropping its hammer and thrashing wildly, jumping and spinning chaotically.
 </p>
 <p>
  Taking a quick breath to steel myself, I moved in for the attack. With a nimble step back, the ogre’s tree-trunk-like fist grazed past my nose in a swift miss. I plunged back into the fray, noticing the ogre’s back arching over. The ogre’s armor, covering its left chest, showed a visible gap.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a firm grip on my sword hilt, I lunged, aiming directly for the beast’s heart. The ogre’s muscular chest put up a fierce resistance against my sword. Undeterred, I twisted my blade, plunging it deeper until I could sense the pulsating beat of its heart through my weapon.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a swift pull, I withdrew my sword. Blood, thick and red, erupted from the gap in the ogre’s chest plate.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a heavy thud, the behemoth’s body collapsed face-first into the muddy sludge.
 </p>
 <p>
  The rain, now tainted with the ogre’s blood, splashed wildly, soaking me to the waist.
 </p>
 <p>
  Stunned by the spectacle, the remaining goblins hesitated, their confidence shattered.
 </p>

 <p>
  Spitting out the rainwater that had slipped past my lips, I pressed on towards the petrified goblins. The first one didn’t even react to my blade, and just as I was about to engage another, Jenna’s urgent voice rang out.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oppa!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s wrong?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I think there’s another one!”

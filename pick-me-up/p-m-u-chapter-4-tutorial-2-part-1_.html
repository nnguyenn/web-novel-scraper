 <p>
  I staggered to my feet.
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s no way back. There’s no way sideways. The only path is forward.

 <p>
  So, does that mean I have to fight that monster?
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han(★)’ has escaped panic!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Here it goes!
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ll Fight. And regardless of whether this is a dream or not, I’ll shatter the face of the person who sent me here.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took a deep breath, in fact, several deep breaths. But even so, my heart didn’t calm down, so I bit my tongue hard. The taste of sharp, metallic blood filled my mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Assess the situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Figure it out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Where am I? What should I do? I can think about the reasons later. I can take my time to look around after waking up from this dream.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If that’s really the case….”
 </p>
 <p>
  I surveyed my surroundings.
 </p>
 <p>
  Burning houses. Desolate cottages. Villagers fleeing. Goblins chasing after them. I had seen this scene somewhere before. It wasn’t just a mere glimpse. I could vividly recall it even now.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pick Me Up.
 </p>
 <p>
  This place was the prologue stage of Pick Me Up.
 </p>
 <p>
  The burning village field. It was much more realistic and detailed, but it was just a “background.” It was like the backdrop of a play. I couldn’t interact with the others, and they couldn’t interact with me.
 </p>
 <p>
  But why am I here…? No.
 </p>
 <p>
  I pushed away the lingering negative thoughts.
 </p>
 <p>
  You can vent your anger later.
 </p>
 <p>
  I twirled the iron sword in my right hand once.
 </p>

 <p>
  My right shoulder became stiff from the weight.
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s only one enemy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although there were hundreds of goblins in the village background, there was only one goblin in the “field.” The rest could be treated as nonexistent.
 </p>
 <p>
  Under the hill, a goblin with a rusty helmet blinked its eyes. Blood dripped from the blade.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Keuk!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I remember looking at this scene and saying… If you’re going to make it, at least make it decent….”
 </p>
 <p>
  The graphics weren’t that good. Pick Me Up is a mobile game. It definitely does not have this kind of graphics. Fangs at the corner of the mouth, red eyes, lumpy bumps on the skin. Splattered blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  Why is it so realistic?
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han(★)’ feels fear! All ability scores reduced by 30%.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tips: Heroes with low fear resistance often experience fear. Be careful.]

 <p>
  Even if you have a bold personality, you can’t help but feel scared when you’re suddenly thrown into a place like this, handed a sword, and told to fight monsters.
 </p>
 <p>
  At least lend me an AK-47 or give me a gun to shoot!
 </p>
 <p>
  Just standing here makes my legs tremble.
 </p>
 <p>
  The surroundings darkened, and my breath rose to my throat.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hot breath escaped from my mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Will it hurt if I get hit by that sword?
 </p>
 <p>
  If I die here, will I die in reality too?
 </p>
 <p>
  Or will I wake up from this dream?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Damn it….”
 </p>
 <p>
  I had no intention of finding out. It would be too painful.

 <p>
  I spat out saliva mixed with blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  The goblin’s physique was smaller than mine. At best, it was the size of a middle school student. Its limbs were thin and frail. In terms of muscles, it probably wasn’t that strong. Whether it’s an elementary or middle school student, one stab with a sword would be enough.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, I was on a steep hill, and the goblin was below.
 </p>
 <p>
  The terrain favored my side!
 </p>
 <p>
  “You bastard!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I sprinted up the hill, kicking off the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  The goblin at the forefront was kicked in the chest and tumbled down.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the goblin rolled, it swung its sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Don’t tense up. Don’t blink. Don’t close your eyes. Watch it to the end! If you don’t look at it, you’ll die!
 </p>
 <p>
  As I took a step back, the blade brushed past my nose. A cold lump of ice settled in my chest.
 </p>

 <p>
  If I had been a little slower…
 </p>
 <p>
  “You piece of crap!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I threw the iron sword. The hilt hit the goblin’s helmet, making a clanging sound. The goblin staggered. I leaped onto it and attacked.
 </p>
 <p>
  The goblin and I fell together.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Die, you bastard!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I took the mount position and landed a punch on the goblin’s face.
 </p>
 <p>
  With both knees pinning its shoulders, I scraped its nose with my fist. There was a thud, and the goblin’s nose sank. Blood splattered.
 </p>
 <p>
  It feels like my head is on fire. Riding on the goblin, I punched wildly like a madman. I even forgot about the sword. I put all my strength into each punch. I punched until my fists were about to break.
 </p>
 <p>
  For a few minutes like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Haah, haah….”

  I rolled away from the goblin and collapsed onto the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  The goblin, covered in blood, twitched slightly and then stopped moving.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stage cleared!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han(★)’ leveled up!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [A reward will be given. Please check your mailbox.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Once again, my vision abruptly shifted.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I opened my eyes, I was in a white room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fatigue had completely disappeared. There were no visible wounds on my body. I stood up unsteadily. Instead of fatigue, a sense of emptiness overwhelmed me.
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  What is this message again?
 </p>
 <p>
  Could it be?
 </p>
 <p>
  I opened the door and stepped into the plaza. Among the tightly closed iron gates, the door to the “Summoning Station” was open.
 </p>
 <p>
  No way.
 </p>
 <p>
  Summoning?
 </p>
 <p>
  [“Master, you’re lucky! Check the hero you summoned. Please touch the ‘Heroes’ tab in the menu.”]

 <p>
  Trembling, I entered the summoning station.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the center of the spacious room, a black magic circle was engraved.
 </p>
 <p>
  Standing on it was a female knight. After a while, part of my field of view sparkled, and Shay’s status window appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Shay Radasterry(★★★★) Lv. 1(Exp 0/10)]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Class: Knight]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Strength: 18/18]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Intelligence: 10/10]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stamina: 16/16]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Agility: 20/20]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Skills: Tactical Combat(Lv.1), Intermediate Swordsmanship(Lv.1), Knight’s Resolve(Lv.1)]
 </p>
 <p>
  The knight was wearing a dazzling suit of armor that could be seen in movies, with her eyes closed. The silver rapier hanging at her waist gleamed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shay opened her eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, I’ve been summoned.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She murmured in a low voice and walked steadily off the magic circle. She glanced at me, who was standing still.
 </p>
 <p>
  “And you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ha, Han Seojin.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Han Seojin? That’s a strange name. I’m Shay Radasterry. A knight.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Shay replied nonchalantly and left the summoning station.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now’s not the time. I scratched my head and followed Shay. She was looking around the vicinity in the center of the plaza.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm, so this is the place. I understand.”

 <p>
  I pulled out the second dagger and hurled it at the girl’s forehead.
 </p>
 <p>
  The dagger pierced through her skull, deeply embedded in its hilt.
 </p>

 <p>
  “This is my answer.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehehe…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The dagger slid out smoothly from her forehead as if time were reversing, and the wound healed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah, if you don’t have this level of determination, you can’t climb the tower. I forgive your rudeness, I forgive you!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A marble door appeared from the darkness.
 </p>
 <p>
  The door opened.
 </p>
 <p>
  Beyond the door, a swirling iridescent light filled the space.
 </p>
 <p>
  I walked slowly towards that door.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll show you, the true prologue prepared just for you, who is starting the climb. The real beginning of Pick Me Up!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The girl’s body scattered into shadows.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kururur.
 </p>
 <p>
  A small vibration spread throughout the entire field.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the narration, a message appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The land where humans and other races coexist, Townia.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The location changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  A setting sun. An ankh harvesting in the golden wheat field.
 </p>
 <p>
  It changed again.
 </p>
 <p>
  A village. Children running around with bright laughter.
 </p>

 <p>
  The scenery shifted like a continuous panorama.
 </p>
 <p>
  Scenes of peaceful human worlds.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among them was the city of Nelsar, which I had seen during my mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  I kept walking through the ever-changing landscapes.
 </p>
 <p>
  [An unknown enemy invades the continent of peace and prosperity!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The location reversed.
 </p>
 <p>
  A burning castle and the field in front of it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soldiers clashed with monsters.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the outcome was clear.
 </p>
 <p>
  The humans were being slaughtered in a one-sided massacre, to the extent that it was difficult to call it a battle.

 </div>
 <p>
  Battles and fights in castles, villages, fields, forests, and deserts all ended in defeat.
 </p>
 <p>
  I walked through the battlefield filled with blood and screams.
 </p>
 <p>
  [In the end, the continent was torn apart by the power of darkness.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Somewhere, a grassy field with countless flowers floated in the field.
 </p>
 <p>
  From within it, a loud voice echoed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you know why Pick Me Up’s difficulty so hard?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Because we have to overturn battles that ended in defeat!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Reverse fate, Loki!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Hope still remains.]
 </p>
 <p>
  In an unknown forest, a girl with red hair and scorched skin was holding a bow.
 </p>

 <p>
  I knew who she was. Her name was Jenna Shirai.
 </p>
 <p>
  The scene changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  An unfamiliar city. Aaron, carrying a burden on his back, was haggling with a middle-aged man. Beside him, a young girl held Aaron’s hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  It changed again.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a training ground, Shay, holding a sword, training with her fellow knights.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master! If you want to save the world, climb the tower!]
 </p>
 <p>
  After that.
 </p>
 <p>
  The daily lives of heroes who had already been summoned and those who would be summoned in the future unfolded.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the faded landscapes, their bodies were shining.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Countless heroes will be with you.]

 <p>
  Lastly, beyond the screen, I was seen using a cellphone.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Such a pain…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, believe in the bond with the heroes. The future of the world lies in your hands!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [“It does! The future of the world depends on you and the Master!”]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Countless enemies will stand in your way!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The scenery suddenly changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Various monsters, hundreds of them, were staring at me from behind a transparent barrier.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took a deep breath and continued walking.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Powerful enemies hidden in various landscapes!]
 </p>
 <p>
  In the depths of the deep sea.

 <p>
  Beyond the sea of clouds.
 </p>
 <p>
  Across vast deserts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Huge and terrifying demons were gathered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shrouded in mist, their exact appearance was not clear, but I could tell they were incredibly sinister.
 </p>
 <p>
  [“Can you climb to the top of this tower, where no one has ever made it before?”]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kraaaaaaah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The monsters roared all at once.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ground itself trembled under the immense sound waves.
 </p>
 <p>
  I glanced back briefly before moving towards the door.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ever-changing scenery unfolded like a comic lens being lifted.
 </p>

 <p>
  Suddenly, I found myself back in the rift that had served as the entrance to this place.
 </p>
 <p>
  Right in front of me was the door leading outside.
 </p>
 <p>
  I stepped my left foot into it.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I turned around, the shadow inside the room’s mirror was wriggling.
 </p>
 <p>
  [“Climb the tower, Loki. I, No. ‘We’ will.”]
 </p>
 <p>
  A pair of red eyes flashed within the shadow.
 </p>
 <p>
  [“…Be waiting for you.”]
 </p>
 <p>
  Just before entering the door, I responded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “F*uck you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  *Crash!*

 <p>
  [Congratulations, Master!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The forgotten memories of the hero were awakened.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★★)’, promotion complete! He became a 2-star hero.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Illustrations are updated.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Level and skill limits have increased.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Blinding light enveloped me.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I opened my eyes, I was standing on the crimson magic circle.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s over.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked up at the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  A dazzling light was flowing.
 </p>
 <p>
  From outside the screen, Anytng was looking down at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  As I left the synthesis room, the door closed one after another.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as I was heading back to the dormitory from the training grounds, I spotted Aaron.
 </p>
 <p>
  When our eyes met, he approached with a delighted expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, hyung-nim. Have you returned?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is everything alright?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “As usual. Still the same.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t find any trace of the melancholy from the previous dawn on his face.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He must have been thinking about the reason to fight.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The reason you fight.
 </p>

  The reason you were brought here, risking your life to battle enemies.
 </p>
 <p>
  “By the way, what did you go in there for alone?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I had a promotion. You’ll be having it soon too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As Aaron and I exchanged some conversation, we headed back to the dormitory.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Nina, was that her name?’
 </p>
 <p>
  She’s Aaron’s younger sister.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the illusion I saw, they were holding hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  He said he wants to come back for her.
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s no need to mention it.
 </p>
 <p>
  I decided to bury it in my heart for a while.

 <p>
  ‘The goal hasn’t changed.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Climbing the tower.
 </p>
 <p>
  Returning to Earth.
 </p>
 <p>
  If there’s one thing that has changed, it’s that I feel much shitty than I did back then.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I won’t forget.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Whoever you are, whatever your name is.
 </p>
 <p>
  I will definitely repay this debt.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I tried to close the door to the dormitory.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unexpectedly, a message appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Welcome to the world of Pick Me Up!]

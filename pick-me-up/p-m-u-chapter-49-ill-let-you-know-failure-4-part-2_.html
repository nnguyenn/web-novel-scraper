  [Master, would you like to end your connection?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes (selected) / No]

 <p>
  [Then goodbye!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The moment the wipeout message appeared, Anytng disconnected.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle, tears welling up in her eyes, appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Loki!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do we do, what do we do! Is Master really quitting?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He might quit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then what about me, what about us!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Tell me, what will happen if he quit?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If the Master doesn’t log in for a certain period, the account gets deleted. Loki knows it too! You can’t let this happen!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I see.
 </p>
 <p>
  I know. If you don’t log in for six months in real-time, the account disappears. Recovery wasn’t possible. Restated to the waiting room time, it’s about a year and six months.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Without the Master, the waiting room cannot be maintained. I won’t be able to interfere too! I’ll disappear! I haven’t even been alive for long!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t jump to conclusions. Nothing’s confirmed yet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But still…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if Anytng disappeared right now, I could somewhat fill his place using the power I have as a half Master. But it wouldn’t be perfect. I still needed Anytng.
 </p>
 <p>
  I grinned and said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry. If he were to quit he would have done it when he synchronized that 4 stars.”

 <p>
  [Really?]
 </p>
 <p>
  I nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Oh, I see. Then I’ll trust you.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “But why are you so desperate? Are you going to die if you don’t climb the tower?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yeah.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Die?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Disappear.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “….”
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed pointless to ask any further questions.
 </p>
 <p>
  After Iselle left, I fell into contemplation.
 </p>

 <p>
  When Anytng returns next time, should I lift the strike or continue it? I sounded confident, but the possibility of him quitting wasn’t zero. If that happened, I would be in trouble.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Wait a moment.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Six months.
 </p>
 <p>
  Niflheimr…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Do I have enough time?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I furrowed my brows.
 </p>
 <p>
  I came to a conclusion.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I won’t lift the strike.’
 </p>
 <p>
  For a quick climb, an equivalent foundation was essential.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unless it was confirmed that Anytng had fully changed his mind, it seemed necessary to maintain it. Even if the results weren’t good.

 <p>
  A more definite failure was needed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Close to or equivalent to almost quitting.
 </p>
 <p>
  All I could do now was wait for the upcoming opportunity.
 </p>
 <p>
  The next evening.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng, who had logged in earlier than usual, immediately brought up the control window to recharge gems.
 </p>
 <p>
  A payment notification appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you want to buy you can make a payment right away!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Mobius supports the Master’s choice!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Gold Triple Package!’ has been selected.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Package Contents – 5,000 gems, 3 gift vouchers]

 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes (selected) / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  Having collected rewards from the mailbox, Anytng immediately started the paid draw.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, advanced summoning is starting. I’m excited to see which heroes will appear!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Talk-talk, drululu.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Thud!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Rare!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master ‘Anytng’ has acquired the hero ‘Nokin (★★★)’!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Rare!]

 <p>
  [Master ‘Anytng’ has…]
 </p>
 <p>
  As expected, it’s a triple summon.
 </p>
 <p>
  I understood why there were three. There were some 1-star heroes in the training ground who couldn’t fit into any party.
 </p>
 <p>
  What you need to do is to assemble a party by combining lower-tier heroes and higher-tier heroes. People pick up this strategy from forums and try to follow it. But they do it without understanding the principles and methods needed.
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  If a sparrow tries to follow a falcon, its liver will get ripped apart.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you’re going to do it like this, you might as well go for a quintuple summon.
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, the three heroes weren’t the worst combination.
 </p>

 <p>
  While one ended up in a critical state, they completed the test safely. It seemed like they understood their roles properly. Anytng gave the three of them gift vouchers obtained from the gold package.
 </p>
 <p>
  Including the two 1-star heroes who were idling around, a party of five was formed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The completed ‘Party 3’ immediately started leveling up as they rolled through the lower floors.
 </p>
 <p>
  A few days later.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna, who had been running after me in the training ground, spoke up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t this getting dangerous?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Those people. Our spots could be taken by them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I glanced at a corner of the training ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  The members of Party 3 were gathered there, engaged in a simulated battle.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-12" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  Three 3-star heroes against two 1-star heroes who were clearly lagging behind.
 </p>
 <p>
  With each swing of the longswords, bruises formed on the bodies of the 1-star heroes.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was more akin to abuse than a simulated battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Leave them be.”
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the 3-star members of Party 3 met my gaze and came closer.
 </p>
 <p>
  The guy looked away nervously.
 </p>
 <p>
  While those three aren’t blatantly running amok like wild wolves, they’re not exactly on the kind side either.
 </p>
 <p>
  They started causing trouble from the first day they arrived here, so Edis and I spared some time to teach them a lesson. Of course, the content of that lesson was enough to make them understand who’s in charge while also making sure they don’t die.
 </p>
 <p>
  More time passed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Party 3 continued to grow steadily without any eliminations. Two swordsmen, one spear user, and two archers. There were no mages, but the balance wasn’t bad. Anytng’s plan seemed to be working well.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why aren’t those guys leaving already? They’ve been rejected by the Master, hehehe. Once we grow a bit more, we’ll be able to take them on. Oh, except for the female mage. We should put her in our party.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t our party already full?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There are two useless ones. We can just kick one out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, that’s an interesting plan.” I came behind him and said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right… urg!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Nokin, who had been gossiping about us in the dining area, turned around to see my face and was startled.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was a level 8, 3-star hero, and the leader of Party 3.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nokin, sweating profusely, said:
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wh-why are you here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just came for a drink. And heard you talking about random stuff.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “It’s nothing, hahaha. Shall we head to bed?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The three members of Party 3 scattered like a swarm of flies.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Teamwork is nonexistent, no matter how you look at it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  They didn’t even treat the 1-star heroes in the same party like people.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, Anytng must be satisfied.
 </p>
 <p>
  In many ways, they might be sloppy, but Party 3 cleared the 14th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like the 13th and 14th floors were easy. The 12th floor must have had a challenging recoil.
 </p>
 <p>
  Or maybe they were just lucky.
 </p>
 <p>
  I checked with Edis, but there were no signs of a Stream this time.
 </p>
 <p>
  The 15th floor seemed to be a mission that could be resolved with only one party of five.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-15" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  None of the members of Party 3 had surpassed level 10.
 </p>
 <p>
  But Anytng was planning to challenge it.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had always done so and had never failed. And the moment Party 3 clears the 15th floor, just as Nokin had assured, we would merge. If there’s an alternative solution, there’s no need to waste time on heroes who don’t listen.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took a sip of water and returned to my room.
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t care.
 </p>
 <p>
  I knew that it wouldn’t be long before I could witness an interesting sight.
 </p>
 <p>
  That moment would be the turning point.

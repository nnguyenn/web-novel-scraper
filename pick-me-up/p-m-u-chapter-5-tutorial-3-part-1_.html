  [Oh, you’re not going?!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why would I go? I would die.”

 <p>
  “It’s not death. It’s synthesis!”
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s the same b*ch!
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle’s adorable eyes wrinkled. Each time the wings on her back fluttered, sparkling dust scattered.
 </p>
 <p>
  She pondered for a moment, then clapped her hands as if remembering something.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If we synthesize, you can return to the original world! Let’s see, Han Israt, where you used to live…”
 </p>
 <p>
  A register appeared next to Iselle. Iselle rummaged through it and stopped at a certain place.
 </p>
 <p>
  “To Townia, where you used to live!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Townia?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Townia’s Heim Peninsula! Your hometown!”
 </p>
 <p>
  It was an unfamiliar place to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was taken aback and retorted, “My hometown is Gangseo-gu in Seoul.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seoul? Gangseo-gu? Such names…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The expression on Iselle’s face, as she alternated between the register and me, stiffened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, well? Wait? Who are you? Why don’t you look like your picture? Han Israt doesn’t look like this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Han Israt, who is that, and where is Townia? I’m Han Seojin, born in Gangseo-gu, Seoul. I don’t know who you are, but let’s just send me back home while I’m still asking nicely, shall we?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait, you…came from Earth?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I came from Earth. You thought I came from Mars?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Cold sweat formed on Iselle’s forehead.
 </p>

 <p>
  Iselle began to search through the register. There were no visible movements, but her pupils rapidly rolled up and down.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How can a being from a higher dimension…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle muttered with a puzzled voice and pointed to the window at the top of the room.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can you see this too?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Now Loading…]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can see it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Augh, ah! How am I supposed to handle this?! I’m going crazy! I’m going crazy!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle shook her head as if headbanging. Her black hair, braided left and right, spun like a windmill.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Anyway, just go in! Go in!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t want to! Why should I? You go in…”
 </p>

 <p>
  [Go in!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle grabbed me by my wrist and threw me forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  As if floating, I felt my body rise and flew into the synthesis chamber.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thunk.
 </p>
 <p>
  The door to the synthesis chamber slammed shut.
 </p>
 <p>
  I immediately got up and pounded on the door. I kicked it and even tried to use my full strength. However, the locked door didn’t budge.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, you! Let me out, you brat! I won’t stay still! I will fight you”
 </p>
 <p>
  Tough that little fairy had quite the strength!
 </p>
 <p>
  I won’t have a chance.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Quiet down, you’re being noisy.”

 <p>
  Shay, leaning against the wall, said. On the floor where I stood, there was a complex and strange magic circle that encompassed the entire room.
 </p>
 <p>
  A thought suddenly came to my mind, and I asked, “You, you…where are you from?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Me? I’m from Arantia.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Arantia? Which region is that? The USA? Canada?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “USA? Canada? What are you talking about? If you’re also a citizen of the Empire, don’t you know the Asinis, one of the Four Great Families?”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘What nonsense is this?’
 </p>
 <p>
  It would be easier to communicate with a foreigner than with this person.
 </p>
 <p>
  Wait, what was I just saying right now?
 </p>
 <p>
  I pressed my lips together. The words that came out just now, those weren’t Korean. They weren’t English or Japanese either.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was an unknown language.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  “Can such a thing even happen?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Half in disbelief, I pulled out the decisive question. Once again, an unknown language escaped my lips. It felt as if the words I wanted to say were being filtered out by my brain.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you come from Townia, by any chance?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, I did.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not Earth?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t know about a place like that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  So, this mage came from Arantia, which is part of Townia.
 </p>
 <p>
  Everything went pitch black. Even my wildest dreams couldn’t compare to this.
 </p>
 <p>
  And above all, the finale of the nightmare awaited.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, synthesis is starting.]

  “Drag and drop the hero you want to synthesize onto the hero you want to offer as a sacrifice. You can gain experience points. The sacrificed hero will disappear.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tips: Registering heroes as favorites can prevent synthesis mistakes.]
 </p>
 <p>
  I can return to the original world, huh?
 </p>
 <p>
  I recalled how the fairy hesitated for a long time when I refused to go to the synthesis chamber. It was all a lie.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pick Me Up, the final gateway that decorates the end of the tutorial.
 </p>
 <p>
  Named Hero Synthesis. Users can experience a tremendous power-up by sacrificing heroes here. I experienced it myself.
 </p>
 <p>
  The problem is, I’m a 1-star hero, and this girl is a 4-star hero.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stats!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you saying?” Shay wondered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Status window!”

 <p>
  I half-shouted those words in frustration.
 </p>
 <p>
  A small window appeared before me.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Han Israt (★) Lv. 2 (Exp 7/20)]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Class: Novice]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Strength: 11/11]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Intelligence: 11/11]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Health: 11/11]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Agility: 11/11]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Skills: None]
 </p>
 <p>
  The fairy called me “Han Israt.”
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-12" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
  <script async="" crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4984013611805253">

 </div>
 <p>
  So, these stats must reflect my current situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at Shay, who was staring at me with curious eyes. This time, I whispered, barely audible, “Status window.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Shay Radasterry (★★★★) Lv. 2 (Exp 3/20)]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Class: Knight]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Strength: 19/19]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Intelligence: 10/10]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Health: 18/18]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Agility: 22/22]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Skills: Tactical Logic (Lv.1), Intermediate Swordsmanship (Lv.1), Knight’s Mindset (Lv.1)]
 </p>
 <p>
  We were both at Level 2, but the difference in stats was like night and day. Moreover, Shay had three prerequisite skills.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among them, the most noticeable one was Tactical Logic. It was an extraordinary passive skill rated as an S-grade among hundreds of skills. Intermediate Swordsmanship provided an attack bonus with swords, and Knight’s Mindset was a supportive skill that resisted mental manipulation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, I had none.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Shay.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I spoke with a trembling voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this a dream?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a dream, but it’s a dream you can’t wake up from.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Shay smiled softly.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Do you really want to proceed with the synthesis?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes (Selected) / No]
 </p>

 <p>
  A bright light radiated from the magic circle engraved on the floor of the summoning chamber. A peculiar sensation engulfed my entire body as if being submerged in water.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, this is how it ends.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If this is truly the world of Pick Me Up, and if the “Master” is controlling this game, I would disappear here as a sacrifice to Shay. All for a few experience points.
 </p>
 <p>
  I might not have made a significant impact during the battle. But judging from the goblin kill count alone, Shay had four, while I had barely one.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who would synthesize a 1-star hero with a 4-star hero?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The light grew stronger, and I closed my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hoping that when I opened them, I would be in my living room.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Synthesis complete!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “‘Shay (★★★★)’ has turned into light and disappeared.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh?”
 </p>

 <p>
  I slowly opened my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shay, on the other side of the magic circle, was being engulfed by light and disappearing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shay smiled bitterly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is where it ends.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why are you vanishing?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I wasn’t chosen. That’s all.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But, wait, is this even possible? You’re 4-star, and I’m 1-star!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I pray for you, Han.”

  Shay transformed into particles of light and scattered away.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clunk.

 <p>
  The door leading to the plaza opened.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This is how heroes become stronger through synthesis.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, believe in your bond with the hero. The future of the world is in the Master’s hands!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The tutorial has ended.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tips from Iselle will always help you. Don’t miss out on the valuable information to become a powerful Master!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [For more detailed strategies, please check the official forum.]

 </p>
 <p>
  [Welcome to the world of Pick Me Up!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Bapabam!]
 </p>
 <p>
  With a loud sound effect, the holographic window disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Standing in the plaza for a while, I shouted loudly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Iselle, are you there? Answer me!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why are you calling me? It’s so annoying!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle appeared in the empty space.
 </p>
 <p>
  She folded her wings and landed on the ground, waving her arms up and down in rage.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What an idiot! Synthesizing a 4-star with a 1-star? Are you brainless? I told you to use favorites! Tips, I told you about the tips! Read the tips! Arghhh, I’m going crazy, I’m going crazy!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  So, that’s what happened.

 <p>
  The reason I survived was simple. The method of hero synthesis involved dragging and dropping the hero to be sacrificed. He inadvertently touched and accepted the sacrifice without realizing it.
 </p>
 <p>
  A bitter laugh escaped me. I survived with just a stroke of luck. On the other hand, Shay died due to a simple control mistake.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, would you like to log out?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes (Selected) / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Goodbye then!]
 </p>
 <p>
  A message announcing the game’s end appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle, who had been fidgeting, wiped away a tear from her eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Damn it, it finally started and it ends like this…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Tell me about the situation. I’m curious and about to go crazy. Where is this place? How did I get here, and how do I go back?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmph, why should I?”
 </p>

  Iselle stomped the ground and then stuck out her tongue.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her figure gradually became blurry.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you want to know, climb the tower. The answers are there. Goodbye then!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, wait!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I waved my hand where Iselle had been, but nothing was caught.
 </p>
 <p>
  She had escaped.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I was left alone in the plaza.
 </p>
 <p>
  Both the cheeky fairy and the knight had disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Both of them knew things I didn’t. If I had known that, I should have asked Shay.
 </p>

 <p>
  Leaving the empty plaza behind, I returned to the room.
 </p>
 <p>
  The room still resembled a luxurious residence. When I opened the closet on the dressing table, there were instant noodles inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a gloomy feeling, I took out a pot and boiled water.
 </p>
 <p>
  Electricity, water, and gas were all functioning. While the water was boiling, I searched for an exit but couldn’t find one. The building itself was an enigma, with no clue about its origins.
 </p>
 <p>
  I gulped down the noodles.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ramen, eaten after a long time, tasted incredibly delicious.
 </p>
 <p>
  Without even cleaning up, I crawled into bed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Only then did I fully realize what had just happened up until this moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  Screech.
 </p>
 <p>
  The goblin’s cry that sounded like boiling phlegm. Their sinister. The Burning houses and the fleeing people. The sound of a sword slicing through the air as it approached me. The sensation of life being extinguished at my fingertips.
 </p>

 <p>
  ‘I wasn’t chosen. That’s all.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Shay’s bitter voice echoed in my mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  You weren’t the one who wasn’t chosen. You were just unlucky. In the first place, it should have been me, the ordinary hero who was supposed to disappear. I remembered Shay, enveloped in light, vanishing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It doesn’t make sense.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I had entered the world of the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Could such a thing really happen?
 </p>
 <p>
  If everything turned out to be a dream when I woke up, it would be laughable.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was even a part of me that wanted to applaud the ridiculous dream of me entering the game world.
 </p>
 <p>
  That I could have such a realistic dream.
 </p>
 <p>
  But if it wasn’t a dream.

  If everything remained the same when I woke up.
 </p>
 <p>
  If this mineral-like room and the empty plaza outside still existed.
 </p>
 <p>
  What If I had really entered the game world as a hero, not as the Master…
 </p>
 <p>
  I flipped the blanket over and thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  Who I was in Pick Me Up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rank 5 out of 100 million Masters worldwide.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no user who knew more about this game than me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I knew almost all the crafting recipes for skills and items, efficient strategies and tactics, hero development methods, and hidden elements.
 </p>
 <p>
  People referred to me as the Master of Masters.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s who I was.

  If, when I woke up, everything remained the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If that happens.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t help but remember the moment just before I crossed over to this world.
 </p>
 <p>
  A level 999 bug monster with an unknown identity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Without a doubt, it was mocking me.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was him. He was the one who had brought me here.
 </p>
 <p>
  I clenched my teeth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You messed with the wrong person.”

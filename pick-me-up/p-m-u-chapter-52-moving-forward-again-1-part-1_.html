 <p>
  I placed the statue of the warhorse on top of the fountain.
 </p>
 <p>
  I intended to take it with me once the master is logged out. However, now that Anytng has returned, we’ll be busy again from today onwards. The tasks to be done were piling up like a mountain.

 <p>
  As I headed to the training ground, Iselle followed along.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Loki, what if the Master hasn’t changed?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s no chance of that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I reassured Iselle’s concern.
 </p>
 <p>
  While we couldn’t be sure to what extent things might change, it was certain that they would. The fact that he went to the official cafe for counseling in itself indicated a change in his state of mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, I would be able to tell how much he changed, the next time I contact him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “When’s the next opportunity?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [The next online meeting, you mean?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle inquired.
 </p>
 <p>
  I nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  [It could take as short as a month, or it might go beyond half a year. It depends on how quickly residual interference accumulates.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s this interference?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s the source that twists Mobius causality and alters the rules. When the Master logs in and watches the waiting room or engages in activities, energy accumulates. As the floor numbers increase, the gathering speed becomes faster. And above all… Gems!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle spun around and raised her right hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  A blue, sparkling gem was clenched in her hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This is a gem! The crystallization of interference, a jewel imbued with the power of creation.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that kind of power in microtransactions?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Of course. Human money carries strong intentions, you know. Cyber money is fine, but what’s even better is cold, hard cash! If you bring cash to the main office, you get an additional 1% payment benefit. Didn’t you know?]

 <p>
  ‘Kind of trivial.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Not many would go all the way to the main office for just 1% extra.
 </p>
 <p>
  Regardless, I knew that this encounter with Anytng wasn’t the last.
 </p>
 <p>
  The most important thing is we continue to build on this foundation, then if any discrepancies emerge, we could correct them during the next encounter.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a bit more breathing room, I planned to investigate about life and death in real life, Mobius, and Pick Me Up. There’s still so much I don’t know. To do that, I felt the need to pick up the pace a bit more, as I had to gather what they called “interference.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The first contact had ended. It was time to assess the changes.
 </p>
 <p>
  After parting ways with Iselle, I entered the training ground. Members of the 1st party were scattered around, engaged in training. I stepped between Jenna and Aaron, who were sparring.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, Oppa?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stop for now, I have something to say. Call Eolka too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Some time later, the members of the 1st party gathered in one place.
 </p>

 <p>
  I immediately spoke up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Effective immediately, the participation restriction of Party 1 is lifted.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The three of them looked at me with bewildered faces.
 </p>
 <p>
  I briefly explained the fact that the Master would change.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna giggled and said, “It didn’t matter to me how the Master was, but still, this is good.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron gripped his spear silently.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eolka alternated her gaze between the two of them and me, then sighed and lowered her shoulders.
 </p>
 <p>
  All three agreed. With sound effects, a system message appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘1st party’ is now manipulable.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Well done, Master. The hero has reversed their heart!]

 <p>
  “You’ve had quite a break all this time. Isn’t your body itching?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, I…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at Eolka calmly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Itchy, itchy. I’m feeling itchy!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The conditions of the three aren’t bad.
 </p>
 <p>
  During the extended strike, they inadvertently had some rest time.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Han, Jenna, Aaron, Eolka!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle’s voice calling the 1st party echoed out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Immediate deployment. I came out to the square with the members.
 </p>

 <p>
  Iselle was fluttering around the square.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the midst of it, Aaron whispered, “Hyung-nim, the Master might have changed his mind, but we’re still just four. Isn’t there one spot vacant?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry about that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I grinned.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle shouted again.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Edis!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Edis unni?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna tilted her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  A moment later, Edis appeared with a puzzled expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why me?”
 </p>

 <p>
  [The Master requested temporary inclusion in the 1st party. Will you do it? Speak up?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis looked at me and said, “You lifted the participation restriction?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “As you can see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “And the Master?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll see in due time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After a brief contemplation, Edis came to a conclusion.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright. If you all are fine with it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘2nd party’ is now manipulable.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The incapacitation of the 2nd party, including Edis, was lifted.
 </p>
 <p>
  The leader’s decision is the will of the entire party. If the bond isn’t strong within the party, it’s deemed impossible.
 </p>

  [Forming a party.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Drag and drop the hero!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Edis (★★★)’ joins ‘1st party’!]
 </p>
 <p>
  And with that Edis’s affiliation was changed to the 1st party.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, it was a temporary measure.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The deadline is until we break through the 15th floor.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As a result of the sacrifice of the 3rd party, it was concluded that the 15th floor required a small-scale mission with a single party. In that case, there’s no need to divide parties. If both sides work well together, we can create temporary parties by mixing elites according to the Master’s intention.
 </p>
 <p>
  The standard method is to insert a new hero and nurture them from level 1, but given the delay due to the strike situation, things had been considerably slowed down.
 </p>
 <p>
  Maintaining speed while pursuing efficiency.
 </p>
 <p>
  I welcome this approach as well. Training new members wouldn’t be too late even after clearing the 15th floor. After all, the leveling speed increases as the floor numbers go higher. This is due to the opening of new facilities and dungeons.

  “I won’t stay long.”

 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t plan to hold you for long.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Open, Rift of Time and Space!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Creak.

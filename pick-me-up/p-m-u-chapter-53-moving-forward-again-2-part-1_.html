 <p>
  I led Eolka into the main hall.
 </p>
 <p>
  The dimly lit lanterns illuminated the interior of the magic hall, and the scent of unknown incense and old books wafted through the air. Eolka, who had entered inside, blinked unexpectedly.

 <p>
  “So, this is the magic hall. Why did you bring me here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I told you. You won’t be training your magic.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I closed the door leading outside. The interior darkened immediately.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What you have to do is research.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Research?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just wait and see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I leaned against the wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  An information window appeared, showing the tech tree of research.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Research!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Current development levels are as follows.]
 </p>
 <p>

 <p>
  I rummaged through the books on the shelf.
 </p>
 <p>
  While spending time in the waiting room, I had realized I could decipher Townia’s language, but the contents of these books were still cryptic. Only magical patterns and formulas were vaguely familiar. I remembered seeing them a few times in the mini-game for crafting items.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle appeared beside Eolka, who was staring blankly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eolka exclaimed in surprise.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t suddenly appear by my side! You startled me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Shush. Get used to things like this. I didn’t appear here just because I felt like it. Anyway, you see that desk over there? There should be a pen and ink. Solve the problems with that pen and put them into the box with the complicated patterns on it.]
 </p>
 <p>
  I closed the book and placed it back on the shelf.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, I looked at Eolka. She was awkwardly approaching a desk on one side of the hall. On the desk, there were a blue-glowing ink, a black feathered pen, and a document covered in strange symbols. Eolka scanned through the document and said,
 </p>
 <p>
  “These are the formulas we used to learn at the magic school…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Solve the problems and put them in the box.]
 </p>

 <p>
  Iselle pointed at the black circular box placed next to the desk.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eolka responded with a baffled expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The reason I have to do this is…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [That’s for research… Anyway, you must do it! Unless you want to get scolded. It’s an order from the Master.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You people always use these methods…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eolka grumbled and sat down at the desk. She dipped the pen in ink and began solving the problems. After 3 minutes, Eolka wrote down the solutions on paper and put it into the box next to the desk. The paper inside the box ignited into blue flames and disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Research points +1 acquired!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Current research speed: 10/h. Requires 10 gems per hour.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The research efficiency isn’t great.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In Pick Me Up, research also requires the premium currency, gems.

 <p>
  10 points per hour was the lowest level. Given the low facility level and Eolka’s lack of research skills, it was inevitable.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Setting research time.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [3 hours per day!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tips/Setting excessive research time might lead to dissatisfaction among researchers! Remember, they have their own lives too.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I just need to solve this last one.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eolka said as she put the last problem into the box.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Eolka’s expression froze the next moment. A document with problems appeared on the desk, thicker than before.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle held out three fingers.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Every day, 3 hours!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “3 hours? No way! You’re telling me to do this for 3 hours? This is giving me a headache. These aren’t simple formulas! I’m already struggling so much!”

 <p>
  [‘Eolka (★★★)’ expresses dissatisfaction!]
 </p>
 <p>
  As expected, this happened.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was something I anticipated. Eolka’s current schedule was already quite demanding. Physical training in the morning, magic training focusing on Telekinesis power in the afternoon, and tactical drills in the evening. I had arranged some rest periods, but the fact was that there was little room for leisure.
 </p>
 <p>
  Asking her to invest another 3 hours here would likely cause resistance. No one really enjoyed overwork.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the training time couldn’t be reduced, and the same went for research time. Research was a crucial factor in determining the expedition’s progress.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eolka pursed her lips.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, you say something too. This gonna enslave me from morning till night.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I pondered for a moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  A way to maintain Eolka’s motivation without losing time.

 <p>
  ‘There is something.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I whispered to myself silently.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘A fur coat.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★★)’ wants ‘Fur Coat’. Would you like to gift it?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Cost: 3,000 gold.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes (selected) / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  A coat covered in white mink fur appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was one of the clothing items available in the gift shop.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eolka’s eyes widened as she looked at the coat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s…!”
 </p>

 <p>
  “You said you wanted it, didn’t you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I smirked.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had heard from Jenna that Eolka wanted warm clothing. The waiting room could get chilly, after all. I tossed the coat to her. Eolka stood up from her chair and eagerly accepted the coat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s prepaid. If you complete the tasks properly, you’ll get more.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eolka hastily put on the fur coat and stroked it in delight.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, suddenly, she muttered in a sarcastic tone.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re trying to change my mind with this? How ridiculous!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you don’t like it, give it back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I held onto the coat and tugged.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eolka held onto it firmly, refusing to let go.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Who said I don’t want it! I mean, I’ll do it, okay? I’ll do it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eolka sat back down in her chair and continued working on the problems.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, Anytng was still managing the operations even after giving instructions for research.
 </p>
 <p>
  After the 2nd party returned, a new 3rd party was formed.
 </p>
 <p>
  It consisted of promising individuals recently summoned. Later, Iselle faintly called out the members of the 3rd party. Among them, those who showed promise might join the 1st or 2nd party.
 </p>
 <p>
  Next, the gathering members were sent to the weekday dungeon, and the members at the equipment workshop were ordered to craft weapons. It was a rather lively movement.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Not bad.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The Master had certainly changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The current tasks were basic, but that’s what made them important. The previous Anytng hadn’t even properly carried out such tasks.
 </p>
 <p>
  While enjoying the control of Anytng, Eolka suddenly struck up a conversation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t you have any intention of learning magic?”

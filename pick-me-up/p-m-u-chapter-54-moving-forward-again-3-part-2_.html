  18 wins out of 19 matches.
 </p>
 <p>
  That was the record of my duels with Jenna.

 <p>
  Of course, the 18 wins were mine. The one loss I had was due to an unfortunate overlap of coincidences, almost like an accident.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you going to surrender? Aaron is waiting.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, no, I’m fine…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron waved his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Adding to that, his record was 32 losses out of 32 matches.
 </p>
 <p>
  We had never gone over 10 minutes.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should probably insert two of them at the same time.’
 </p>
 <p>
  By my estimation, it was time for the levels of my Skill ‘Inferior Swordsmanship’ at level 6 and Projectile Defense Skill at level 2 to rise. With the right opportunity, I would soon be able to break through that barrier.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as I was contemplating the skills, Jenna raised her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No. I’ll try a little longer.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright, let’s do it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I thrust my sword forward and leaped.
 </p>
 <p>
  In that moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Twang!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Jenna (★)’ has acquired ‘Weakness Detection’!]
 </p>
 <p>
  A red cross-shaped light flashed in Jenna’s eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ping! Ping-ping!
 </p>
 <p>
  With a time lag, three arrows flew.
 </p>

 <p>
  Thanks to the Projectile Defense skill, the trajectory, speed, and point of impact were all visualized in my mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The three arrows followed each other meticulously, exploiting openings.
 </p>
 <p>
  My way of dealing with arrows was to dodge or block. With this, I could block the second arrow as well. However, the precise aim of the third and final arrow was at a point where I couldn’t react.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang!
 </p>
 <p>
  I deflected the third arrow with my shield.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the first time I used a shield in a duel against Jenna.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Augh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna exclaimed in disappointment.
 </p>
 <p>
  With my sword extended, I muttered,

  “Where did you learn this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I just thought of it. If there’s a skill for blocking, there should be one for piercing, so I wanted to try…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Originally, I had intended to give her a hint after the duel was over.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna had two ways to overcome her current challenge. Shoot with such force that I couldn’t block it, or aim at a spot where it’s hard to block. The first was a skill called ‘Strong Bow’, and the second was the ‘Weakness Detection’ she had just gained.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s interesting.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Did she acquire the skill with just a casual comment? Moreover, ‘Weakness Detection’ was one of the skills that had significant synergy with rapid fire.
 </p>
 <p>
  There might not be a need to include Aaron.
 </p>
 <p>
  I extended my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s go again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It won’t be easy like before.”

 <p>
  The random arrows being shot at me became more precise.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first arrow forced a reaction, and the second or third aimed at vital spots. Sometimes, a fake shot was mixed in. Dealing with them became much more challenging.
 </p>
 <p>
  She could now include both real and fake movements within the shooting.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Jenna (★)’s ‘Low-Grade Archery’ has increased to Level 6!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Arrows came relentlessly.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the past, I would have deflected them all at once and closed the distance, but I couldn’t narrow the gap between Jenna and me as easily. I didn’t use the shield unless it was an emergency. This was still a training to acquire skills.
 </p>
 <p>
  I needed to go beyond just observing the trajectory.
 </p>
 <p>
  If I could grasp the intention behind the arrows.
 </p>
 <p>
  Time seemed to slow down.
 </p>
 <p>
  Something like white threads started appearing at the tips of the arrows, almost like ethereal strands.

 </p>
 <p>
  Clang clang clang clang!
 </p>
 <p>
  I deflected the arrows without leaving anything behind and closed in.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, with a bewildered expression, I thrust my sword into Jenna’s neck.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Does this make it 19 wins for me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mo, monster…”

  Amidst the crowd of onlookers, I heard that voice.

 <p>
  As I turned my gaze, they scattered like a swarm of ants.
 </p>
 <p>
  Insight.
 </p>
 <p>
  It helped distinguish illusions, slightly enhanced vision and also provided versatile benefits by giving adjustments to weapon skills. There seemed to be effects I didn’t know about as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘So, how many skills do I have?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I brought up the status window.

 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s quite a few.’
 </p>
 <p>
  From Inferior Swordsmanship to Equestrianism, there were a total of 8 skills. It’s too many for a 2-star Level 11.
 </p>
 <p>
  Coincidentally, Jenna and Aaron were discussing skills.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aaron oppa, how many skills do you have?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Me? Well. Inferior Spear Technique, Pain Resistance, Fire Resistance. Those three. What about you, Jenna?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Inferior Archery, Inferior Dagger Technique, Switching, Quick Draw, Weakness Detection, Eagle Eye, Agile Body… there’s something else too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s enough.”

 <p>
  Aaron mumbled with a melancholic voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  I interjected, “Having many skills doesn’t necessarily make you stronger.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The strength of skills is determined by level and synergy more than quantity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having too many skills could even be a disadvantage. For example, my Ferocity and Calmness. They became quite the odd combination.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But it’s true they lean towards the stronger side.’
 </p>
 <p>
  From Agile Body to Forest Hunter, and even Fire Resistance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna had a total of 9 skills.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anyway, during the ongoing training, Anytng was diligently managing the waiting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle’s voice calling for members to go to the dungeon rang incessantly. The equipment workshop was running day and night, and occasional messages announcing the summoning of 1-star monsters appeared. One point I wanted to make was to avoid synthesis, and if they read the documents I sent properly, they should be able to learn how and when to use it.
 </p>
 <p>
  The 15th floor is right ahead, but there seems to be some freedom for now.
 </p>
 <p>
  After the strike, we visited the dungeon a few times, but all were under the 10th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unless we achieve a certain level of growth, it seemed we didn’t intend to send anyone to the 15th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  I don’t want to relive the struggles I had on the 5th and 10th floors.
 </p>
 <p>
  I want to challenge it when I’m in the best condition. But even if I could do that, I can’t guarantee 100% survival.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gripping his spear with a tense expression, Aaron came out of the training field.
 </p>
 <p>
  I adjusted my sword.

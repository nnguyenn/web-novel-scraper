 <p>
  Priasis looked at me with unwavering eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  I knew she wanted power. And it seemed like she knew what she wanted. But telling me such a story was futile, no matter how many times she tried.

 <p>
  I narrowed my eyes and spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So you want me to help you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t understand why you’re asking someone like me for help, but wouldn’t it be much easier to wield power if you were a princess? Skilled knights would line up to serve you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis’s gaze wavered.
 </p>
 <p>
  The girl closed her eyes tightly and lowered her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m just a scarecrow. Only a princess in the name. Besides that, there’s nothing to me. No one listens to me. No one follows me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But you have money. You could hire mercenaries.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then I’ll hire you as a mercenary. I’ll pay you as much as you want. I might be only a princess by name, but I have plenty of gold coins.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis rummaged through her dress and pulled out a silk pouch. The pouch was filled with sparkling gold coins.
 </p>
 <p>
  But I had to bite the hand that was trying to hand me the pouch.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t know what you want to do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have several things in mind.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a refusal. Find someone else.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m the one who wants to ask why? I might not understand the sense of money in this place, but with that amount of gold, you could hire more capable people.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Because you didn’t mock my story.”
 </p>

 <p>
  Priasis spoke with a serious voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  “When I brought up the story of my dream, no one believed me. No one even tried to listen properly. But you’re different. That’s why I want to hire you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is troublesome.’
 </p>
 <p>
  This kid is just an NPC.
 </p>
 <p>
  If what I heard during the promotion ceremony is correct, the current stage is Townia’s past. Even if I had a willingness to accept, the contract couldn’t be fulfilled. This brat and I were in a temporary relationship, and we would part ways when the mission was over.
 </p>
 <p>
  I shook my head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “… Is it a refusal?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s a reason for this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What reason?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Outside the window, it’s still a pale blue.
 </p>

 <p>
  There’s plenty of time until deep night.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the girl in front of me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis was examining my complexion with a serious gaze.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sighed and then spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We came from a different world.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A different world?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A really messed up place. There, we’re given missions, and if we don’t fulfill those missions, we die. Our coming here was also part of that mission.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you talking about? Coming from a different world.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I didn’t expect her to understand.’
 </p>
 <p>
  After thinking a bit more, I decided to add more to my explanation.
 </p>

 <p>
  There’s nothing to do until dawn anyway. It wouldn’t be bad to keep this kid company.
 </p>
 <p>
  I explained the goal of this mission, that it was about escorting, and if we failed to protect the target, we would die. As I finished speaking, Priasis held out her hand in confusion.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait a moment. So, you guys came to this place from a different world to fulfill a mission?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah. When the mission is over, we’re forcibly sent back to our original world. So I can’t take on your request.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Such a silly story.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis mumbled in a low voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t something easy to talk about, but it wasn’t something impossible to talk about either.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter who I told, they wouldn’t believe it, and even if it was revealed, it wouldn’t have any impact. I just needed to keep my secret hidden.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is this a lie to avoid me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Think what you want. Whether you believe it or not doesn’t matter.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Then I understand. I’ll trust your story. So, you guys are warriors from a different world.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I felt a bit dumbfounded but then regained my senses.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, she’s a girl who seriously believes in what she saw in a dream.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just as you didn’t mock my story, I won’t disregard yours. I know there are reasons. I won’t hold you any longer. You should do your thing. I’ll do mine.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s your thing?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t it obvious? To prevent that dream from becoming reality.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I recalled the situation when the mission started.
 </p>
 <p>
  The citizens were gathering in the central square of the city.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Were you the one who gathered these people in the square?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Silver Temple? Yes, I did. I was planning to give a speech.”
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-6" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  “Why were you planning to give a speech?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “To gain influence. As I am now, compared to my brother, I’m no different from a beggar.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Influence.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If things were normal, this kid would’ve been dead and buried here nine times out of ten.
 </p>
 <p>
  If there’s any meaning to the Pick Me Up mission, it meant that this NPC named Priasis Al Ragna had some value worth resurrecting.
 </p>
 <p>
  I closed my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a Master, I remembered the mission of my previous game, Nieflheimr.
 </p>
 <p>
  At first glance, they seemed unrelated. Scenes of heroes and NPCs having conversations-like interactions were visible, but the contents were inaudible. The locations and times were all mixed up. But upon closer examination, I came to the conclusion that there might be common threads connecting the missions.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I wonder if the contract has already been made.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled.

  “My name is Han.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Han.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis muttered my name repeatedly as if tasting it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you. If it weren’t for you, I would have died.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not over yet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They want to kill you. Do you have any idea why?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “… I don’t know.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you don’t know, then forget about it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis lowered her head.
 </p>

 <p>
  I seemed to have acquired roughly the information I could get by asking.
 </p>
 <p>
  Waiting began again.
 </p>
 <p>
  I decided to take another look around the house. Until a few years ago, this seemed to be the home of a prosperous family. The feeling of life remained in every corner.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the wardrobe on the second floor, I found worn but relatively clean clothes.
 </p>
 <p>
  I came downstairs to the living room and tossed the clothes to Priasis, who was half-dozing.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Change into these.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis widened her eyes and looked at the fabric.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a worn shirt and skirt with traces of use.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You stand out too much. You’re like a walking billboard.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A billboard?”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Used the wrong term.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled bitterly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anyway, Priasis’s attire easily caught the eye. Even if it was dirty, the golden crown and the silver dress would shine even in darkness. It would be a hindrance to our future actions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You want me to wear these clothes? Then, what I was wearing…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll get rid of that. There’s a trash bin outside.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you dislike it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis raised her head, but her face was visibly gloomy.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, I’m grateful. It’s about time to get rid of it. However…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “However?”
 </p>

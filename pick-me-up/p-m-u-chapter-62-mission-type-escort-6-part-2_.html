  “Then die.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★★)’ has entered a frenzy state!]

 <p>
  I triggered the switch in my mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  The veins on the arm holding the sword stood out vividly.
 </p>
 <p>
  I charged forward and swung the sword forcefully.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang!
 </p>
 <p>
  The steel plate was dented deeply.
 </p>
 <p>
  The knight wavered for a moment, then managed to block the second strike aimed at his neck. But he couldn’t block the third strike aimed at his thigh. The sword’s grip had a strong anti-recoil mechanism.
 </p>
 <p>
  With power approaching 40.
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t penetrate the steel plate, but I could break it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang! Clang! Clang!
 </p>
 <p>
  Every swing of my sword caused the armor to deform. I aimed for the gap between the plates that were exposed during each of his moves, but the knight desperately defended each spot. Even so, it wouldn’t take more than 10 minutes to bring him down.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Jenna (★★)’ is in a bleeding state. Her health decreases at regular intervals.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Aaron (★★)’ has fallen into a critical state. His life is in danger!]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Unbelievable.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Eolka (★★★)’ has entered a mana surge state.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tips/Mana surge is a state that occurs when a magician uses magic excessively.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It hasn’t even been 10 minutes yet?’
 </p>
 <p>
  The gap in the knight’s visor traced a line resembling a smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  The knight wouldn’t attack. He feared countering. He was stationed at the entrance, blocking only fatal strikes.

 <p>
  “Kid, run!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I shouted loudly, my voice no longer concerned whether the surrounding soldiers heard.
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis stumbled out onto the street. Then she started to run.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang!
 </p>
 <p>
  The clash of swords rang out.
 </p>
 <p>
  I yelled fiercely.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No matter what happens, don’t worry about it. Get out of the gate. Run along the path!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Priasis sprinted desperately.
 </p>
 <p>
  The knight remained steadfastly in the middle of the gate. He wouldn’t move for me, but he would to Priasis. He would strike without hesitation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Get lost!”
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  I used all my strength to push the knight away.
 </p>
 <p>
  The knight held up his greatsword to block, but his body was pushed back. In that gap, Priasis lunged.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  With the sound of slicing through the air, the greatsword swung. I quickly twisted my body. My stance was shaky, but I managed to block it somehow. A powerful impact shook my whole body.
 </p>
 <p>
  Above the gate, a shadow projected from the ceiling cast a violet line towards Priasis, who was passing through the passage. An assassin.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no room to block with a sword. I turned my body and took the dagger.
 </p>
 <p>
  The dagger pierced into my left shoulder.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★★)’ is now in a poisoned state. Health decreases at regular intervals.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Party wipe crisis!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, the party’s situation is critical!]

 </div>
 <p>
  This time, the knight swung his greatsword at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t feel anything in the left arm where the dagger had stuck. I was struck by the greatsword. My body, weaker than the weight, slammed into the corridor wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★★)’ is in a bleeding state. Health decreases at regular intervals.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Han, no!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you stop, you’ll die by my hands!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pausing briefly in that spot, Priasis turned to look at me, nodded slightly, and started running again.
 </p>
 <p>
  I inspected my left shoulder. Violet liquid was oozing from the half-buried dagger. I skimmed it with the blade of my sword, and then as I got up, I swung the sword in the air. The poisonous liquid on the sword sprayed onto the knight’s visor.
 </p>
 <p>
  The knight clutched his face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did it get in your eyes?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled weakly.

 <p>
  [‘Edis (★★★)’ is in a bleeding state. Health decreases at regular intervals.]
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked around and there was a crossbow aimed at the target.
 </p>
 <p>
  The target needed no introduction. It was Priasis, who was escaping through the gate. But the assassin was too far to reach him.
 </p>
 <p>
  I picked up a stone from the ground and hurled it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ping!
 </p>
 <p>
  Mid-flight, the stone collided with the bolt and sent it veering off course. The assassin stared at me in disbelief.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you looking at, punk!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I pulled out the dagger lodged in my left shoulder and threw it.
 </p>
 <p>
  The dagger plunged into the assassin’s hood. The assassin collapsed immediately.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gradually, Priasis’ figure vanished beyond the gate.

 <p>
  “……Phew.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked down.
 </p>
 <p>
  The knight was clutching his head, writhing as if in pain.
 </p>
 <p>
  He seemed like he wanted to remove the helmet, but his arms only twitched feebly outside the helmet. I picked up the greatsword lying next to the knight with one hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  With all my strength, I swung the greatsword down onto the knight’s head.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thump!
 </p>
 <p>
  A section of the helmet caved in deeply, and black fluid splattered through the gaps.
 </p>
 <p>
  The knight froze like a dead insect.
 </p>
 <p>
  After confirming the deaths of the knight and the assassin, I leaned against the wall as if collapsing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Blood was flowing from the long gash on my body. I had blocked the greatsword, but my stance hadn’t been good, and got injured.

 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The poison is spreading quickly.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I let out a cough.
 </p>
 <p>
  The blood I spat out was tinged with purple.
 </p>
 <p>
  I slid down against the wall, feeling like I was slipping away.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What a damn mess.”
 </p>
 <p>
  5th floor, 10th floor, 15th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Every mission pushed my body to its limits.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Tired.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I closed my eyes.

 <p>
  My job was done. The rest depended on whether the party could hold out until the target reached its destination. Considering their conditions, Aaron was close to death, Edis and Jenna were injured, and Eolka couldn’t use magic.
 </p>
 <p>
  A while later, a message appeared in the darkness.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The escorted target has escaped the city.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Stage cleared!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★★)’, ‘Jenna (★★)’, ‘Aaron (★★)’, ‘Eolka (★★★)’, ‘Edis (★★★)’ level up!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Rewards – 100,000G, Iron Ore (A) x3]
 </p>
 <p>
  [MVP – ‘Han (★★)’]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is there anyone dead?’
 </p>
 <p>
  All five of us leveled up.
 </p>
 <p>
  I faintly smiled.

  Back through the rifts of time and space.
 </p>
 <p>
  The familiar circular field.

 <p>
  I hung my sword on my belt and raised my shield. The wounds and poison had been thoroughly cleansed. However, a strong sense of discomfort lingered due to the aftermath of recovery.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Whoa! I thought I was going to die!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna slapped my shoulder as she got up. Upon seeing me, she ignited a flame.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oppa you’re the one who told her to give me those weird clothes, didn’t you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Feeling unhappy? They looked pretty expensive though.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Clothes are clothes, in their own way. They’re even uncomfortable to move in. They were in a trash can. And did you know that the soldiers rushed at me as if they were crazy, also they were only targeting me?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna grumbled as she slung her bow over her shoulder.
 </p>
 <p>
  I grinned and opened the door leading to the plaza. The distinctive cool air of the waiting room enveloped me. I glanced back at my party members.
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis was stowing a thrown dagger that had fallen to the ground into her sheath, and Eolka was catching her breath with a slightly depleted expression. Jenna was counting the number of arrows in her quiver.
 </p>
 <p>
  And Aaron had his head bowed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not many unscathed ones around.”
 </p>
 <p>
  They were acting nonchalant, but even Jenna’s hand, while counting arrows, trembled ever so slightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis was probably the only calm one.
 </p>
 <p>
  As expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  If we had been a minute late for the clear, there might have been casualties. The fact that no one died could only be attributed to luck.
 </p>
 <p>
  “[Recording complete!]”
 </p>
 <p>
  “[Video saved! The video will be stored in the gallery. You can also watch it with other users online.]”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked up.
 </p>

 <p>
  The sky was shining white. It took about 6 hours to clear the mission. Since the sky is like this, then Anytng had been watching us for a long time. If he had logged in late at night, he might have stayed up all night.
 </p>
 <p>
  “[Master, would you like to end the connection?]”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes (Selected) / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Goodbye then!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng disconnected frighteningly as the message announcing the completion of the recording appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sky darkened. The sight of the extra personnel heading to the equipment workshop beyond the door to the plaza, on their way to work, could be seen.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is it already morning?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good job, everyone. No one died, and we cleared the boss stage. Especially Edis. It would have been much harder without you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It was just a matter of course.”

 <p>
  Edis smiled softly.
 </p>
 <p>
  She was practically the MVP of this mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  She quickly analyzed the geography of the city and provided accurate information to the party. Both leading the soldiers away and setting up decoys for the party wouldn’t have been possible without Edis.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you going back to the 2nd party now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s the plan. I wasn’t planning on staying long anyway. The Master will fill my position with someone else.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a shame.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Skilled thieves weren’t easy to find.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the battles were battles, the thief class was essential to the party for other missions. Jenna was somewhat similar, but she was also an archer type and hadn’t undergone a job change yet. She was lacking in various ways compared to Edis.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll go first.”
 </p>

 <p>
  Edis, who had secured her dagger on her belt, left for the plaza.
 </p>
 <p>
  Asher and Dica were waiting for her in the plaza. With both of her comrades, Edis returned to her quarters.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s always this hard.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eolka sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I want to rest now too. I stayed up all night. My skin feels damaged.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do as you please. You’ve worked hard too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So have you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eolka glanced at Aaron, who had his head lowered, before leaving the spacetime rift.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, only Jenna, Aaron, and I remained in the rift. Jenna went through her preparations and approached Aaron.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Aaron Oppa, don’t be disappointed. It was just bad luck. You didn’t cause any harm.”
 </p>

 <p>
  Aaron didn’t respond.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna sighed, then said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, I’ll be going too. See you tomorrow.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna disappeared into the rift. There was no reason for me to stay here either. I needed to rest and recover my strength before thinking about what to do next.
 </p>
 <p>
  As I was about to leave the plaza, I heard Aaron’s voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hyungnim.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m sorry. It’s because of me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I know well enough.”
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  I grinned.
 </p>
 <p>
  If we were to be objective, we had suffered quite a lot of losses because of Aaron in this mission. We wouldn’t have faced a crisis if he hadn’t been injured. However, it was entirely my decision. Even if we had been wiped out, it was due to my lack of judgment, not something I blamed Aaron for.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t do that next time. I won’t save you twice.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is there a guarantee that I won’t do it again next time?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What nonsense is this again?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hyungnim, do you plan to keep pulling me along until the end?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron’s voice was trembling.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked back. I couldn’t see Aaron’s expression as he bowed his head deeply.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No matter how hard I try, I don’t think I can catch up. The gap seems to widen as time goes on. With Eolka, Jenna, and you, hyungnim.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “And?”
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-7" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
  <script async="" crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4984013611805253">

 </div>
 <p>
  “… I’m sorry. I think I’m just talking nonsense.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After shaking his head, Aaron walked past me in a heavy-hearted manner and left the spacetime rift.
 </p>
 <p>
  As we emerged into the plaza, I caught sight of Aaron’s back as he headed toward the training grounds.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Indeed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I knew what he was struggling with.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron’s current level was 14. The same as Jenna’s and similar to mine.
 </p>
 <p>
  But if you looked into the details, there was quite a gap. First, Aaron’s growth stats were at the lowest level, 4, from the 1-star tier. Jenna and I got into 5 midway through, I sometimes go up to 6, but Aaron didn’t change even when he was promoted.
 </p>
 <p>
  And when it came to skills, the gap was even more severe.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron had the skills of Novice Spear Arts, Pain Resistance, and Flame Resistance. Of course, having numerous skills didn’t necessarily mean they were good. But Aaron’s proficiency wasn’t high. His highest level skill, Novice Spear Arts, was merely at level 4. His foundation in combat skills was solid, but his ability to apply them was sorely lacking.
 </p>
 <p>
  For now, we might be able to get by somehow.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-12" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
  <script async="" crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4984013611805253">

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  But as time passed, the gap would widen significantly. Eventually, Aaron would either be excluded from the party or die due to his lack of ability.
 </p>
 <p>
  He lacked talent.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had nothing to say about that.
 </p>
 <p>
  I did feel a slight attachment to Aaron. Otherwise, I would have discarded him without hesitation when he got poisoned. But I wasn’t so mad as to force an utterly useless member into the party.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He doesn’t have much time left with us either.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If he can’t keep up, I’ll discard him.
 </p>
 <p>
  That fact was still valid.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, rather than discarding, it’s more like finding him a different role.
 </p>
 <p>
  Coincidentally, the position of the instructor at the training grounds was vacant. Aaron would do well if he took on that role.
 </p>
 <p>
  I returned to my lodgings.

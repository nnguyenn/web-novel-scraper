 <p>
  Early in the dawn, after finishing the meal prepared by Chloe, I headed out to the training grounds.
 </p>
 <p>
  As usual, I followed the same schedule, returning late in the evening, without any expeditions to the dungeon. The members of the 1st party were excluded from the dungeon that had been part of their routine.

 <p>
  After conquering the 15th floor, it seemed like Anytng was focusing on something on the other side. His main tasks were nurturing sub-parties and collecting resources.
 </p>
 <p>
  After completing the morning training, and on the way to the dining hall for lunch,
 </p>
 <p>
  I found a group of heroes emerging from the rifts of time and space. They were the party that had just finished the weekly dungeon. Enok, the carpenter, was among them. His expression was deeply furrowed. As he was about to separate from the group and enter the warehouse, I grabbed his arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s wrong?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They’re not helping.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Enok spoke in an emotionless tone.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They tossed a few branches and chatted in the forest. Thanks to that, I worked hard all by myself.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Enok glanced at the people heading to the dormitories and sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Enok rarely expressed himself this way, with such little emotional change.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The situation has changed a lot. Back then, people like that had no choice but to die. Do you think that the world is better now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Perhaps.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have to go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Enok entered the warehouse. He seemed to be preparing to transport lumber from the warehouse to the equipment crafting center. As a skilled carpenter, he was constantly busy without any time to spare.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng was logged in. He must be aware that the results of the weekly dungeon and the training were not the same as before. Operational efficiency was rapidly declining.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Hmm.’
 </p>
 <p>
  There were two ways to handle this.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first was to go through mass synthesis. In that case, almost all second-generation heroes would be sacrificed. However, work and training efficiency would increase. If you didn’t want to die, there was no other choice.
 </p>

  </script>
 </div>
 <p>
  This method had significant drawbacks.
 </p>
 <p>
  If synthesis was overused, the stress level in the waiting room would skyrocket. Therefore, most masters were inclined to regulate their stress levels by conducting synthesis at an appropriate level.
 </p>
 <p>
  The second was to give heroes a motivation other than fear.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Let’s see how it plays out.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng wouldn’t just stand by like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether the first or second option, a decision needed to be made.
 </p>
 <p>
  I entered the dormitory’s dining hall.
 </p>
 <p>
  The lunch menu consisted of boiled chicken soup.
 </p>
 <p>
  And that evening.
 </p>
 <p>
  While practicing with my sword at the training grounds the door to the magic workshop opened, and Eolka appeared.
 </p>

 <p>
  Eolka had taken a break from training, but she hadn’t stopped her research. It seemed she had successfully finished her research for today.
 </p>
 <p>
  After raising hero responsiveness and consistently researching without missing a beat, points had accumulated quite a bit.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng immediately brought up the research status window.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Research!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Current development status is as follows.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [1. Hero Responsiveness Research (Lv.1)]
 </p>
 <p>
  [2. Facility Scalability Research (Lv.0)]
 </p>
 <p>
  [3. Dungeon Complexity Research (Lv.0)]
 </p>
 <p>
  The cursor moved to select number 2.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Facility Scalability Research’ has been selected.]

  [Facility customization feature is now open.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tips/Facility customization allows you to change the structure of facilities to your liking. Decorate and change your own waiting room, Master!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike the hero responsiveness, there was no noticeable effect.
 </p>
 <p>
  A message indicating function opening appeared quite simply.

 <p>
  Facility customization.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a system that allowed for the restructuring of facility layouts. Dozens of construction tools were provided, allowing for the creation of even intricate and complex structures based on the Master’s manipulation.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took a sip of water.
 </p>
 <p>
  Research on facilities was complete. It seemed like the process of renovating the waiting room was about to start.
 </p>
 <p>
  It had been a long time since expanding the waiting room, and there were many heroes now. It was a valid choice.
 </p>
 <p>
  As I stood up, Aaron, who had just finished sparring with Edis, approached.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since returning from the 15th floor, Aaron’s days had been filled with rigorous training from morning till night. His entire body was drenched in sweat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hyungnim, can we have one round?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “With that body? You won’t last a minute.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m fine.”
 </p>

  “Aren’t you pushing yourself too hard?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Perhaps, but…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I attached the sword to my belt as I leaned against the wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  ***
 </p>
 <p>
  As the evening approached midnight, the training grounds were nearly empty except for members of the 1st and 2nd parties. The 3rd party was out in battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s still early. Where are you going?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna asked as she came out of the shooting range.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m not going anywhere. I’m just preparing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What? For what…?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Everyone gather at the plaza!]
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-7" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  Iselle’s booming voice echoed through the entire waiting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  I shrugged my shoulders.
 </p>
 <p>
  “For this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How do you predict things like this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anyway, we need to gather. Training is on hold. Wrap up what you were doing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After placing the tools back on the rack, we headed to the plaza.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dozens of people were bustling in the plaza. It was enough to make the plaza feel crowded. Anytng had conducted at least one draw a day. All of them were free draws.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna looked up and mumbled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s the first time the Master has called everyone like this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Could it be for synthesis?”
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-12" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  Edis’ expression changed to one of concern.
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled and said, “10 people would be synthesized.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That many?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s the problem, master can always draw again?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So he’s sacrificing them all…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “True.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the heroes gathered in the plaza.
 </p>
 <p>
  Support heroes like Chloe and Enok. Combat heroes like me, Jenna, and Edis. And even those who weren’t really useful. The third-tier seedlings avoided my gaze, their eyes skittering away when they met mine.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Is everyone here? Except for those who went to the dungeon? If you were sleeping and didn’t come, you’ll be in trouble!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Everyone’s here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Chloe said.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle nodded in satisfaction and said, [We’re about to undergo a major operation. So, all of you stay put in the warehouse and don’t come out. There’s a chance you might disappear if you get caught in it. Got it?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “If it’s an operation… It’s the same thing we did last time!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna’s eyes gleamed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, the number of people has increased. It’s time for some renovations. I wonder how things will change.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “An operation?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You came late, so you wouldn’t know. Sometimes the Master creates facilities in the waiting room. I wish they’d make a hot spring bath this time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna responded to Edis’ question with a cheerful smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Everyone here, head to the warehouse. Execute!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The door to the warehouse creaked open.

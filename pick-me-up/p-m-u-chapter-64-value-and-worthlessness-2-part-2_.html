  [Everyone here, head to the warehouse. Execute!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The door to the warehouse creaked open.
 </p>

 <p>
  People entered the warehouse one after another. When I entered, the door closed behind me. The warehouse was cold and dark. People whispered nervously with anxious faces. Aaron asked me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you think will come of this, Hyungnim?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who knows. It’s clear that things won’t go as expected, but…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “As expected?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ll see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  There had been several opportunities to level up facilities.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Anytng had waited until the scalability research was complete before starting the upgrades.
 </p>
 <p>
  The intention was clear.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were enough gems to build the facilities.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng hadn’t done any paid draws since the previous charge.
 </p>
 <p>
  A message guiding the construction appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Constructing a facility. Please touch the desired facility type.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Dormitory Lv.3’ has been selected. Would you like to expand this building?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes (selected) / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Dormitory has reached Level 3. Hero possession limit has increased.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Starting with the dormitory, the completion windows for buildings appeared one after another.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Bathing House,’ a subsidiary building of ‘Dormitory,’ has been selected. Would you like to construct it?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes (selected) / No]
 </p>

 <p>
  [‘Training Grounds Lv.3’… ]
 </p>
 <p>
  Krrr.
 </p>
 <p>
  An untimely vibration shook the waiting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  People looked around uneasily.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Bathing House has been completed! Heroes’ facility satisfaction will improve.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Lounge has been completed! Heroes’ fatigue will significantly decrease.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Restaurant has reached Level 2! High-quality meals will be provided to heroes.]

 <p>
  [Great!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [As facilities proliferate, the plaza evolves to Level 3!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Excellent!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [The waiting room evolved to Level 2! More floors are added. You will be able to install more facilities.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng didn’t stop operating.
 </p>
 <p>
  Following the facility window, the customization window opened.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Changing the structure of the facility.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You can load external map data.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna was explaining the current situation to the people.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You know the Master, right? He’s in the process of creating new buildings for us. We used to live in shabby places at first.”

  “You can think of it that way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s great! The beds were uncomfortable.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can we try new dishes too?”
 </p>
 <p>
  People were chattering cheerfully all of a sudden.
 </p>
 <p>
  Their faces were filled with anticipation.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Construction complete! Heroes can come out of the warehouse.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The door leading to the plaza opened.
 </p>
 <p>
  People poured out as if they had been waiting.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh wow, it’s really different! The buildings have changed!”
 </p>

 <p>
  Someone exclaimed with a delighted face.
 </p>
 <p>
  I walked out slowly from the back of the group.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The second floor has been added.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The structure of the plaza wasn’t much different from before, but now there were tall stairs leading upward in one corner. Beyond the stairs was a transparent ceiling. It was both the ceiling of the first floor and the sky beyond the second floor, visible as if it pierced through.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Bathing house! Bathing house!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Interesting.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna ran towards the dormitory. Edis followed behind, muttering.
 </p>
 <p>
  A small parade formed from the warehouse to the dormitory.
 </p>
 <p>
  The dormitory has a second floor as well now, and so do the training grounds.
 </p>
 <p>
  In other words, the entire waiting room had transformed from a one-story to a two-story structure.
 </p>

 <p>
  First-floor dormitory.
 </p>
 <p>
  Confusion rather than joy appeared on people’s faces.
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis murmured, “Doesn’t it feel worse for some reason?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s true.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The radiators were gone. The sofas were gone too. Decorations like carpets and frames had all disappeared. There were only a few chairs in the lobby that looked like they might break if you sat on them.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What happened here!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It wasn’t like this last time?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna mumbled with a puzzled face.
 </p>
 <p>
  A young woman walked out into the corridor and said, “The beds are gone too. Are you asking us to sleep on the floor now?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s not possible, there’s no way…”
 </p>

 <p>
  “There is a way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I stepped forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  Everyone’s attention focused on me. I tapped the stairs with my foot as I said, “Can’t you see the stairs? Just go up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Could it be!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna’s eyes sparkled, and she quickly climbed the stairs.
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally, as if understanding, people followed Jenna.
 </p>
 <p>
  The second floor perfectly met people’s expectations.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soft carpets and a fireplace. Plush sofas. In the rooms were beds with high-quality sheets, and the bathing house was filled with warm and clean water. People, their faces full of joy, started discussing which room they would stay in.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, there was no one who wanted to stay on the first floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Why are you all talking nonsense?]
 </p>

 <p>
  “Nonsense…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s not over yet. Everyone, gather in the 2nd-floor plaza! Master will personally assign your rooms.]
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, everyone gathered in the 2nd-floor plaza.
 </p>
 <p>
  The basic structure was similar, but from the second floor, you could look down at the 1st-floor plaza.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Configuring facility details.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You have selected the dormitory. The subsidiary buildings are as follows.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Restaurant Lv.2, Bathing House Lv.1, Lounge Lv.1]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Restaurant Lv.2]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Manager: ‘Chloe (★)’, ‘Amarine (★)’]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Available types of dishes: Meat, Potatoes, Fruits… ]
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng’s control panel was moving chaotically in one corner of the field of vision.
 </p>
 <p>
  People thought something strange was happening, so they murmured.
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can’t understand Master’s intention.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  What Anytng was doing was simple.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was creating a hierarchy in the waiting room.

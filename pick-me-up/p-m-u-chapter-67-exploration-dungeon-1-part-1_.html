 <p>
  On the following day,
 </p>
 <p>
  After finishing my morning routine, I stepped out into the lobby.
 </p>

 <p>
  The lobby, which had gone through a renovation, was luxurious enough to remind one of a high-end hotel.
 </p>
 <p>
  I walked through the corridor to the dining area.
 </p>
 <p>
  The second-level dining area was also neat and tidy. A long table with a white tablecloth was in the center. And there, Jenna was having breakfast.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, Oppa, did you wake up?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna waved her hand as she looked at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  While waving her hand, she mumbled. In front of her were bread, bacon, and a meat stew.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oddly enough, breakfast is really delicious today. Thanks to that, I’m eating to my heart’s content.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna put a piece of bacon into her mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her eyes seemed to twinkle with joy.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course. It’s a given when you have fewer people to feed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I pulled out a chair next to Jenna and sat down.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just until yesterday, there was only a single piece of meat in the stew, and the bacon was unbelievably tough. The bread was hard and dry. Beyond the ingredients, there wasn’t enough time to cook. They had to prepare a meal for 35 people with only two of cooks.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, with the number of people reduced by more than half, the ingredient usage per person had greatly increased, and there was more preparation time. The days of the cooks working tirelessly without rest were over.
 </p>
 <p>
  The heroes on the first floor might be peeling potato skins now.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna continued to hum a tune as she continued eating.
 </p>
 <p>
  The reason Jenna’s skin seemed unusually radiant might be because she spent the entire night in the bathhouse. I also received my share of food and started eating.
 </p>
 <p>
  After the meal, Jenna and I headed to the square.
 </p>
 <p>
  The second-floor square was empty. It was expected. Lazy individuals who would chatter even in the early morning wouldn’t come up to the second floor. They were either sleeping after staying up all night or had already gone to the facilities or training grounds.

 <p>
  I opened the door to the training ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was Aaron, thrusting a spear into a wooden doll.
 </p>
 <p>
  This guy had been at the training ground until the latest hours yesterday and was the earliest one there today. Except for Aaron, we were the fastest. The second party’s activity hours were slightly later than ours.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Have you arrived?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron greeted me as he folded the spear.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sighed and spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you get at least 4 hours of sleep?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “About 3 hours, I think.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re quite the amazing one.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With precise movements, the tip of the spear pierced into the wooden doll.
 </p>

 <p>
  After finishing his routine, Aaron approached us. And as always, the basic physical training began.
 </p>
 <p>
  The most significant change in the Level 3 training ground was the addition of individual training rooms and a sparring area.
 </p>
 <p>
  The individual training rooms were divided by walls and could be locked from the inside. We could now engage in the aggressive training we did only at dawn without worrying about being pierced by the others’ eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sparring area referred to the high platform at the center of the second-floor training ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  One could ascend using the stairs, and it was surrounded by iron bars. The distinct feature from other spaces was that high-speed recovery didn’t apply here. Healing tricks using the waiting room’s properties didn’t work here. It meant that sparring could happen under the same conditions as real combat. Of course, if you suffered severe injuries, you had to be pulled out quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  After about 30 minutes, Eolka appeared, yawning.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eolka glanced at us running on the track as if uninterested and then went into the magic hall. Eolka’s training break was until today. However, that didn’t mean she was goofing off. When Eolka didn’t have physical training, she studied magic in the hall’s library.
 </p>
 <p>
  A while later, the second party joined us, and we had enough personnel for the day.
 </p>
 <p>
  As always, a busy day began. During breaks in training, I would come down to the first-floor square to observe. Unlike a few days ago, there were very few people scattered around. Most were either in the training ground or learning skills from the support heroes in the facilities.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Two individuals seem promising.”
 </p>

 <p>
  I peered inside through the open door of the first-floor training ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the first-floor training ground, Velkist was sparring one-on-one with other heroes. Although it was a spar, they held real swords. It was probably Velkist’s idea. Except for the first party, Velkist was the only one who used real swords during sparring.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Rogue personality. Fearless. Talented.”
 </p>
 <p>
  For instance, Velkist’s newly awakened skill, “Wild,” was a rare ability with an acquisition rate of less than 1%. It was different from composure or frenzy. Wild converted mental states like fear or anger into combat power, and when combined with skills that caused forced mental states, it gained tremendous synergy.
 </p>
 <p>
  I shifted my gaze in another direction.
 </p>
 <p>
  A woman with short black hair and a cool demeanor was fiercely attacking a wooden doll with her slender sword. Neryssa Llyor. She was a dual-sword user who alternated between slender and short swords.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her combat power itself was lower than Velkist’s, but her personality was generally calm and composed. Furthermore, she had exceptional senses for special actions like stealth, ambush, and intelligence gathering. With proper training, she would develop into a respectable rogue-type Hero.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘There’s no need to see the rest.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Whenever Velkist’s sword swung, inevitably, one person would flinch.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the three of them were teaming up, they couldn’t become a real threat. Neryssa was the only one capable of being a threat. Even though all of them were summoned around the same time, the differences had become significant.
 </p>

 <p>
  Velkist who laid the three of them on the ground looked at me and smirked.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though I couldn’t hear the sound, I could understand the meaning.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Senpai, are you going to try too?’
 </p>
 <p>
  “You arrogant brat.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled and drew my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then I entered the first-floor training ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  As expected, Velkist wasn’t my match.
 </p>
 <p>
  After messing around to some extent, things would quiet down for a while. It was praiseworthy that he endured the pain even in situations where his entire body was being assaulted.
 </p>
 <p>
  After training until evening, Anytng logged in.
 </p>
 <p>
  After sending the low-level heroes he recruited yesterday on another mission, Anytng began touring the day dungeons. Starting from Facility Level 4, various materials such as ores, wood, and leather were needed. A new role as a gatherer for farming would be introduced from now on.

 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Party 1, gather!]
 </p>
 <p>
  It had been three days since Iselle called us.
 </p>
 <p>
  After finishing the training schedule, I got up from my seat, where I had been analyzing the state of the waiting room from my room on the second floor. After organizing the data, I came out to the plaza. Except for me, members of Party 1 were gathered in the square.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ah, going up and down is so exhausting. Have I gotten old?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle pouted while patting her shoulder.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eolka interrupted Iselle’s complaint with a lack of interest.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s the matter? Are we climbing a new floor?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It won’t be a new floor. One person is missing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I said.
 </p>

 <p>
  The last members of Party 1 and Party 2 hadn’t been filled yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  The circumstances were different from the 15th floor.

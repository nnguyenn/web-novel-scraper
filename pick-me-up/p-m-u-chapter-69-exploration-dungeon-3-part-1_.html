 <p>
  They stepped out of the inn.
 </p>
 <p>
  The boy protested that he was busy, but I didn’t let him go. At the very least, I needed to get some guidance in exchange for the coins. With some effort, he reluctantly led the way while grumbling.

 <p>
  “This isn’t right… I need to finish my work by evening…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you think a few words really be worth the value of a golden coin?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The boy pouted his lips and secured his leather bag.
 </p>
 <p>
  I followed closely behind the boy as he walked briskly down the street. He was heading in the direction of the inner city, passing by the intersection where the inn was located. The faint silhouette of the inner city wall could be seen beyond the heads of passersby.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…’
 </p>
 <p>
  He’s going inwards, not towards the outskirts of the city.
 </p>
 <p>
  Two possibilities came to mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  Either this kid was trying to deceive me, or the dungeon was indeed located within the city.
 </p>
 <p>
  I would find out the moment we reach our destination.
 </p>
 <p>
  The result became clear after 5 minutes.
 </p>
 <p>
  As we moved further into the city, the number of mercenaries increased. Some wounded individuals were being carried out on stretchers, blood flowing from their severed limbs.
 </p>
 <p>
  The boy frowned upon seeing the injured men.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is why I didn’t want to come here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, the dungeon is within the city.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “To be precise, it’s in the center of the city, right next to the temple. It appeared right after the Nelsa invasion ended.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The boy passed through the city gate.
 </p>
 <p>
  Familiar buildings were visible right ahead. A tall tower made of bricks. It was the watchtower we used for scouting at the 10th floor. The cathedral on the right was also the same as he described, though it seemed more like a temple than a cathedral.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…What’s that?’
 </p>

 <p>
  Between the watchtower and the temple, a distinctive structure caught my eye.
 </p>
 <p>
  A massive staircase leading underground. Sturdy iron grating surrounded the staircase. A knight clad in elaborate silver armor stood at the entrance within the iron grating. Mercenaries, merchants, and priests were scattered around the area.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That staircase is the entrance to the dungeon. Pretty easy to spot, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Doesn’t look like much.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, if it’s nothing special, would they station guards like that? Besides the stones I mentioned, various treasures pour out from the dungeon. From coins to gems, even valuable equipment! It’s a true treasure trove. Well, you can’t just walk out with everything, though.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A party consisting of two men and a woman tried to enter the staircase.
 </p>
 <p>
  The knight blocked their way. The man at the front presented a shiny piece of silver.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The church holds the monopoly on the dungeon. They profit by selling passes like that. They also take a share of the treasures that come out from inside. They’re just greedy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I nodded my head.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clearly, entering for free wasn’t an option.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Anyway, this should cover the cost, right? Can we go back now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good job. You’re free to go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I decided to leave it at that, even though I could make him spend the entire day here.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had asked everything worth asking. The rest, I could find out on my own.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you have more questions, come back. I’ll give you some special treatment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “And where can I find you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’ll have to find out on your own!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The boy muttered and quickly disappeared into the crowd.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sat down on a nearby wooden bench below a tree. It seemed you could buy passes with coins. I could also go and see for myself. But that wasn’t my intention.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had left my party behind and didn’t have enough time to make an attempt. I was ill-prepared.
 </p>

 <p>
  The projected return time displayed at the top of my field of vision indicated 45 hours.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking at the mercenaries going into the dungeon, they were all laden with supplies. I could see cooking utensils through the openings in their open bags. It meant conquering the dungeon within a day or two was nearly impossible.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wouldn’t make sense to regroup with the party now either.
 </p>
 <p>
  The fact that I knew about Priasis’ status and the existence of a dungeon where I could acquire the Advent Stone was already enough gain.
 </p>
 <p>
  I can come back later, after finding someone that I can trust him with the waiting room for a long time.
 </p>
 <p>
  With this, the general information gathering is complete.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I have nothing to do.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I scratched my head.
 </p>
 <p>
  The work was completed in less than a day. It would be okay to ask nearby mercenaries about the dungeon, but I’m not too keen on it.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the first place, a lot of the mercenaries are watching, but only a few are entering.
 </p>

 <p>
  Those who can overcome the hidden walls and those who cannot. Probably most of them are the latter.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a result of observation for about 30 minutes, the ratio is less than 10 to 1.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, it seemed that if someone who could pass through went ahead, their companions could also enter. Therefore, the term “bringer” seemed to apply. They seemed to be looking around, checking if there was anyone else who could pass.
 </p>
 <p>
  I crossed my arms and pondered.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was certain that I could get across.
 </p>
 <p>
  After all, there was still time. Resting wasn’t appealing either.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Should I gather a party and go in?’
 </p>
 <p>
  With no risk, there’s no gain.
 </p>
 <p>
  If something were to happen, I could leave it and come out.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I made up my mind and stood up, someone grabbed my sleeve.
 </p>

  “Hyung, you’re still here!”
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the boy who had left 30 minutes ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  He seemed oddly excited.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is it? You said you were going to work.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s true. I took the coin you gave me to a jeweler, and it seems it’s worth more than I thought. It’s an ancient coin or something.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, you see…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can’t give you more. Don’t think you can take advantage of me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not like that!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The boy puffed up his cheeks and raised his voice.
 </p>

  “It’s free, I mean free. Don’t you want the service I mentioned earlier?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m not interested.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems like you’re curious about the witch. There’s an unspoken rumor.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The boy looked around and leaned close to my ear.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Actually, that witch was framed by the church…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I know. There’s no need to say it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What?! How did you know? I had a hard time obtaining this information!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I stood up from my seat.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had intended to explore the dungeon, but this little brat was killing my enthusiasm.
 </p>
 <p>
  The boy followed closely behind me.

  “Don’t follow me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, I’ll guide you through the city then! I know all the best places to eat. I used to be a guide, you know.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t need it. Why do you keep bothering me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I brushed off the boy and headed out.
 </p>
 <p>
  But thanks to him I learned a new thing.
 </p>
 <p>
  I needed to exchange the golden coins to use them properly. I had decided to go to a jeweler. The boy hurriedly spoke beside me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s because you look a lot like someone I know, Hyung!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Someone you know?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Black hair and black eyes! Hyung, aren’t you from the Eastern minority? Among the kids I’m hanging out with, there’s someone who looks similar. He’s much younger, though.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I stopped in my tracks.

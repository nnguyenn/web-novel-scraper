 <p>
  The middle-aged man stepped forward as if trying to calm the surroundings.
 </p>
 <p>
  “For starters, one thing is certain: none of us, including you, know anything about this place. By sharing what we each know, we might obtain valuable information. Shall we start with introductions? Does anyone have a different opinion?”
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  The people remained silent. The man smiled satisfactorily and began speaking.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let me introduce myself first. I’m Lyle, thirty-four years old. I run a carpentry shop in Edora. I have a wife and two daughters. As for why I’m here… I’m sorry, but I don’t remember. Next, will you introduce yourself?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m Grete. I’m thirty-two. I used to be a street vendor in Halsea. I don’t know why I came here either.”
 </p>
 <p>
  People started introducing themselves, going clockwise around the circle.
 </p>
 <p>
  Their ages and occupations varied. Merchants, loggers, carpenters, blacksmiths, coachmen, hunters, butchers…
 </p>
 <p>
  They introduced themselves as practitioners of long-lost professions. They were dressed in rough clothing made of leather and fabric, and they spoke names and terms I had never heard before.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle had mentioned that I was from Taonia. I didn’t know the reason, but the clothes I was wearing when I arrived here weren’t sweatpants but similar to theirs.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike Shay, they seemed completely unaware of the current situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anyway, my expectations were correct.
 </p>
 <p>
  These people are not from Earth. They seemed to be natives of the continent Iselle called “Townia.” There are humans there too, but their civilization seems to be much more backward compared to Earth. Among the eleven of us, I was the only one from Earth.
 </p>
 <p>
  The introductions of the people gathered in the square were over.
 </p>
 <p>
  Through their introductions, all we could gather was the fact that they knew nothing. Lyle asked multiple times if anyone remembered how they came here, but no one, including himself, had any knowledge.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is embarrassing…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lyle stroked his beard and wore a troubled expression. But as if saying, “When did that ever happen,” he clapped his hands together and revived the atmosphere among the people.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shall we start by looking around this place? It could be dangerous to wander alone, so let’s pair up into groups of four, three, and three…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you saying, old man!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As expected, she appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle sprinkled stardust as she circled above us.
 </p>

  “Since the Master seems to be opening a rift in space-time, get ready for a fight or something!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You, you…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m Iselle, the fairy who manages this place! Don’t complain if you don’t want to get hurt.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly a man stepped forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  I squinted my eyes. His name was Molmont. He’s the only one among us with two stars. He used to be a mercenary, he said. He wore a worn leather armor and had a proper sword at his waist.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Status.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I muttered while looking at Molmont.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Molmont Karl (★★) Lv. 1 (Exp 0/10)]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Class: Novice]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Strength: 14/14]

  [Stamina: 12/12]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Dexterity: 12/12]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Skills: Novice Swordsmanship (Lv.1)]
 </p>
 <p>
  His initial stats weren’t bad. His intelligence, which is useless for anyone except a mage, was 10. Compared to the 1-star characters who start with all stats at 10, he was much better.
 </p>
 <p>
  Molmont stepped forward and spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you the one who brought us here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Who do you think you are, doing whatever you want!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sharp sound of metal scraping made everyone hold their breath. Molmont drew his sword and aimed it at Iselle.
 </p>

 <p>
  [Don’t do it, you will regret it.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll wipe you out!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Molmont let out a battle cry as he thrust his sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a thrust filled with considerable momentum.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle suddenly smirked, and his head suddenly exploded.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Molmont (★★)’ has returned to the embrace of the goddess. His determination will be remembered forever.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Instant death!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Sign – Suicide due to stress]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tips: Heroes can become tired, fall into depression, or panic. Reduce their stress levels! Provide resting places and toys for your heroes. It can prevent unexpected deaths.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud.
 </p>

 <p>
  Molmont’s headless body collapsed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kyaaaah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What, what the hell! He’s dead? He’s dead! What is this!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [If you don’t want to die, don’t complain, okay? If you touch me, you’ll be minced meat. It’s self-defense. Got it?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle flicked her right hand, and droplets of blood scattered. With those fern-like hands, she smashed the head of an adult man in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  Suicide due to stress?
 </p>
 <p>
  Does that look like suicide to you!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh, ugh, ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Some people with weak stomachs vomited and collapsed.
 </p>
 <p>
  I felt nauseous too. There was a human corpse right in front of me.

  [Open, rift of space-time!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The door at the front of the square creaked open.
 </p>
 <p>
  “W-What’s happening? What is this!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Calm down! Calm down! First, calm down, Miss. Fairy! So, why did you call us? If you want something, just tell us!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lyle stuttered as he asked Iselle.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle covered her ears with her index fingers and spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  [What do I want? Listen to me, fight well, win well. That’s it. Easy, right?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “W-Well, what should we do then?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Step forward if your name is called. Lyle, Ranto, Marlin, Kelkeld, Jackson!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What if we don’t want to?”

 <p>
  [If you want to be like that guy, don’t come out.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle pointed at the headless corpse.
 </p>
 <p>
  The five of them reluctantly managed to step forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Now, stand in order. See that door over there? Go inside.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wait a minute!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I spoke up.
 </p>
 <p>
  [You again! What now!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course, you want to climb the tower too, don’t you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle’s expression crumpled.
 </p>
 <p>
  It looked like she was about to burst into laughter. If not, there would have been no need for her to get angry when the master lost Shay. She might have even scoffed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [So what if I do?]
 </p>
 <p>
  “As the Master to draw weapons too. We’re all 1-star heroes. We don’t even have basic weapons. You don’t plan on sending a suicide squad, do you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Well… Fine, wait a minute!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle disappeared with a “poof.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, the heroes don’t have equipment.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Before embarking on the adventure, would you like to summon equipment for smoother battles?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tips: Heroes without weapons enter battles wielding worn iron swords (F). If you place equipment in the armory, heroes will equip them automatically. Of course, you can also specify the weapons you want to give. Prepare the equipment. Don’t forget!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Another assumption came true.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle could interfere with the system messages.
 </p>
 <p>
  Following Iselle’s guidance, Anytng entered the summoning station and started summoning right away.

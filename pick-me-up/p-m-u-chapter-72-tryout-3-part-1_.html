  Aaron said nothing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis spoke up.

 <p>
  “The roles of a swordman and a spearbearer are different. It’s not about strength but about formation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Formation issues, huh? That could be true.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist limped out of the training area.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then he downed the water on the shelf. As if the paralysis had been lifted, Velkist’s bent upper body straightened. And then he continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I want to ask. Does that theory apply even if the spearbearer can’t do his job properly?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you mean?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis squinted her eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist laughed coldly and spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I, too, watched the seniors’ fights in the rift of space and time. It was very interesting. But there was one person who didn’t fit in. Is a spearbearer really that necessary? To the point that you have to tolerate such weakness? I think differently.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist’s gaze shifted to Aaron.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you not feel your limits, senior?”
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no hint of a smile on his face.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist was speaking sincerely.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron bit his lip and lowered his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna frowned.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t talk nonsense! Aaron is doing well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Lady, you have an abundance of talent, so you may not understand. Sometimes, gentle comfort can be more venomous.”

 <p>
  “What…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Quiet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Both of them fell silent at my words. I looked at Aaron.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron looked at the ground with a contemplative look in his eyes. His right hand, clenched with force, was stained white.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, as you said, a spearbearer may not be absolutely necessary. If a skilled swordsman joins, we can use other formations.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oppa…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But that’s when the swordsman is stronger than the spearbearer. Do you think you’ll be more helpful than Aaron?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If I wasn’t confident, I wouldn’t have spoken up. I challenge you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist drew his sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then he stared at Aaron with fiery eyes.
 </p>

 <p>
  ‘Is it finally happening?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I noticed that Aaron was pushing himself harder than usual.
 </p>
 <p>
  He knew that if he continued like this, it would end badly. Whether he collapsed on his own or fell during a mission. To overcome this, he needed at least a little spark.
 </p>
 <p>
  I said to Velkist.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You better not underestimate him. Aaron has been here much longer than you. If you challenge him with mere confidence and lose, I will never change my mind about you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry. If I lose, I’ll join the second party without speaking a word. I won’t break my promise.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist ran his hand over the blade.
 </p>
 <p>
  A drop of blood trickled down his index finger.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You decide, Aaron. This will end if you just say no.”
 </p>
 <p>
  They say you don’t need a spearman, but in fact it’s good to have one. Also, Aaron has been practicing formation in Party 1 for a long time and has been working well with us.

 <p>
  Even if the gap is growing, it is not that significant yet. For the time being, he can still function as a first-party member.
 </p>
 <p>
  But Aaron shook his head with a heavy expression and said to me:
 </p>
 <p>
  “Give me 5 minutes, please.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron closed his eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  A short break.
 </p>
 <p>
  After Neryssa left the training area without looking back, Jenna persuaded Aaron not to fight, and Eolka joined in. Aaron didn’t respond.
 </p>
 <p>
  The second party gathered around Edis and had a serious discussion.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist sat down in a corner of the training area, sharpening his sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  And five minutes later.
 </p>

  “I’ve made my decision, hyungnim.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What will you do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I’ll give it a try.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you lose, you can’t come back to the first party. Be prepared for that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron adjusted his spear and walked to the training area.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist smirked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve been waiting for that answer.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist stood up immediately.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the two of them stepped onto the training area, the entrance was closed amid loud noises.

 <p>
  ‘It got out of my hands.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Since things turned out like this, there was nothing I could do.
 </p>
 <p>
  I said, “The winner of this duel will join the first party. Do you agree?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I agree.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I agree.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The duel message appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Velkist (★★)’ challenges ‘Aaron (★★)’ to a duel!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Aaron (★★)’ challenges ‘Velkist (★★)’ to a duel!]

  [Do you agree?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes (selected) / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, Anytng touched Yes again.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a click, the sound of the training area’s entrance door locking echoed. Until the outcome was decided, no one could enter the training area.
 </p>
 <p>
  “He left, Aaron oppa. Are you fine like this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s his decision.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I know that. But what if he loses? Velkist is quite strong.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If he does what he always does in training he will be fine.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Both sides had a weapon skill level of 4.
 </p>
 <p>
  Additionally, Velkist had a few passive abilities that Aaron didn’t possess.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-12" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  However, Aaron had a greater advantage, and that was the difference in experience.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist hadn’t been here for long.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike Aaron, who had fought enemies in various situations, Velkist hadn’t even experienced a boss stage firsthand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crucially, Velkist lacked experience in facing spearbearers like Roderick and Aaron. In contrast, Aaron had faced such situations dozens, even hundreds of times.
 </p>
 <p>
  The techniques of a sword and a spear differed.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how skilled Velkist was, he wouldn’t adapt to a spear right from the start.
 </p>
 <p>
  In time, Velkist might become a threat with accumulated experience, but at this point, Aaron had the upper hand in this duel.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Just stick to what you’ve been doing.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist unsheathed his sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron gripped his spear firmly with both hands, adopting the textbook stance of spear technique, bending his knees.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Begin.”
 </p>

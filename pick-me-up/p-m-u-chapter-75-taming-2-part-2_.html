 <p>
  The next morning.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist and Neryssa didn’t show up for morning training.
 </p>

 <p>
  Eolka looked surprised.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where did those two go? They didn’t desert right after coming here, did they?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, they went to the first floor.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why the first floor?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “They asked for some time from me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yesterday, Neryssa came to my room in the early morning.
 </p>
 <p>
  The request was to remove the two from tomorrow’s training schedule. I readily agreed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eolka’s complexion brightened.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, what about today’s training…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Since two of them are gone, we should increase the intensity.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh no!”
 </p>
 <p>
  That morning, Eolka received an extra pouch of sand.
 </p>
 <p>
  And in the afternoon.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t until late in the evening that the two of them showed up at the training ground. I sheathed my sword and approached them.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you adequately prepared?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “As much as we can be.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa answered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist remained expressionless, but his eyes revealed his determination.
 </p>

 <p>
  “Jenna.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, I’m ready.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna, who had been practicing at the shooting range, came down.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna wiped the sweat off with a towel and alternated her gaze between the two.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are both of you ready? Oppa said it’s a one time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re ready.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll go up first.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna gracefully ascended to the training ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  On her left belt were two short swords, and on her right, a short bow and quiver were attached.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do as we discussed.”
 </p>

 <p>
  Neryssa whispered to Velkist.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist furrowed his brows for a moment but then relaxed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally, the two of them entered the training ground. The iron bars closed with a loud noise.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The rules are the same as yesterday. Use real weapons, and there are no other restrictions. You only get one chance.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We understand.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa drew her rapier.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist also brandished his short swords. He took a stance and mumbled, “This doesn’t feel right, but I have no choice.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The duel began.
 </p>
 <p>
  As always, Jenna initiated an attack.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm?”
 </p>

 <p>
  Jenna hesitated for a moment instead of reaching for her arrows. At the same moment, Velkist and Neryssa, who had been spreading out to the sides, froze in place.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anyway, here it goes!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna’s arrow was aimed at Neryssa.
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa had weaker throwing resistance compared to Velkist. It was a reasonable decision to knock down the weaker one first.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Velkist, standing beside her, moved suddenly and shattered the arrow aimed at Neryssa.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, Neryssa threw a short sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna narrowly dodged the blade. At the same time, the second round of shooting followed. Jenna had the ability to maintain continuous shooting in any position. Five arrows were aimed at various vulnerable points on Neryssa’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now I can see it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Skill Awakening!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Velkist (★★)’ has acquired ‘Throwing Resistance’!]

 </div>
 <p>
  Velkist swung his sword, causing the arrows to fall in unison.
 </p>
 <p>
  With his sword held sideways, Velkist rushed towards Jenna.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re too far away.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna calmly blocked his attack with an arrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  The distance between the two wasn’t close enough yet. It was still Jenna’s territory. Five arrows aimed at vulnerable spots and gaps in movements were heading towards Velkist.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist dodged one arrow and deflected two.
 </p>
 <p>
  Two arrows remained. With their unavoidable trajectories and speed, Velkist continued his charge. Suddenly, Neryssa, who had appeared from behind, shattered the two arrows with her rapier.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It took them two days.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I heaved a sigh.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you can’t handle it alone, handle it together.

 </div>
 <p>
  They made a fuss because they didn’t know something so simple.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist and Neryssa, covering each other’s weaknesses, broke through the barrage of arrows and closed the distance to Jenna.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then they split apart.
 </p>
 <p>
  And simultaneously, they merged.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s over.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna avoided Velkist’s thrust by jumping backward, kicking against the iron bars.
 </p>
 <p>
  The short sword chased after Jenna’s back. Then, Neryssa, who had sprung up to the same position, thrust with her rapier. At the same time, Velkist thrust from below to above.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna’s posture was disrupted, and her dress was torn.
 </p>

 <p>
  Before she could regain her composure, Neryssa grabbed her.
 </p>
 <p>
  A dagger was at Jenna’s throat.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s over.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did I… lose?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna scratched her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Such an easy thing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist muttered dejectedly.
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled and stepped forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You struggled all day because you didn’t know this ‘easy’ thing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If they had seen the battle on the boss stage, they would have known that group strength took precedence over individual strength. They just hadn’t emotionally accepted it. I was merely helping them realize that.

 <p>
  “Anyway, you passed. Remember this feeling.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can we defeat the senior with this fighting style?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Wanna try?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I drew my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  And naturally.
 </p>
 <p>
  The two of them were utterly defeated by me.

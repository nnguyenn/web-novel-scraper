 <p>
  Light enveloped our entire beings.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I opened my eyes, we were back through the rift of time and space.

  Our time spent on the 16th floor was approximately half a day. Looking up at the sky, I noticed that the light had faded. It seemed that Anytng had disconnected after what had been a somewhat lengthy mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Will the 17th floor be the same?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Probably.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna’s face was filled with dissatisfaction.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t like this. I wish it would end quickly. It feels like it’s getting late, I need to go freshen up first.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna hung her bow on her back and gestured to Eloka.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka followed Jenna, and as always, it seemed like they were heading to the baths together. I turned to Velkist and Neryssa, who were waiting behind me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Today’s mission is over. Well done. There’s training again tomorrow morning, so don’t be late.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll be on our way then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist sheathed his sword and strode out.
 </p>
 <p>
  That left just Neryssa and me. Neryssa was standing nearby, looking somewhat hesitant.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you have something to say?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have something to tell you about the place we just visited.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa’s gaze was fixed and determined.
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed, her reaction was unusual when we first entered the 16th floor. I proceeded to the plaza.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Follow me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>

 <p>
  The 1st-floor plaza was now empty, unlike before.
 </p>
 <p>
  It had been a long time. The plaza’s clock indicated early morning, and the sky was a deep, ashy blue. I ascended to the 2nd floor through the stairs. The direction was towards the dormitories. I saw Velkist’s back at the entrance of the open 2nd-floor training hall.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…’
 </p>
 <p>
  I had already realized that he was just as much of a training enthusiast as Aaron.
 </p>
 <p>
  As I passed Velkist, I closed the door to the training hall with my toe. Then I entered the dormitory. Neryssa followed me.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was late at night, so the dining hall was deserted.
 </p>
 <p>
  I took a seat at any table. Neryssa sat across from me.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the center of the table were a teapot and cups. I poured water into a cup and handed it to Neryssa.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, what did you want to say?”
 </p>

 <p>
  Neryssa took a sip of water with a stiff expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then she spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The mansion we just visited. I know that place.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t just know it; I used to work there before coming here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I remained silent and then replied.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why are you telling me this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Because I think your chances of survival are higher if you know.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, fine. If you have information, share it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It was better to know than to go in blindly.
 </p>

 <p>
  Since the labyrinth appeared, there was a possibility that it would lead to a boss stage. More information was always better.
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That place is the residence of the Halkion family, often called the Golden Mansion.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Halkion?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, one of the four major families of Townia. You must have heard of it since you’re from the Han Family.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t know much about it. I’m just a farmer from a humble background.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No one would believe that, though.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Regardless, Neryssa gave me an overview of the Empire and the four major families.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Townia continent was ruled by a single nation, called the Empire, and within it existed four families with power comparable to nobility: the Shutenberg of Magic, the Halkion of Gold, the Lantia of Culture, and the Assinis of Martial Arts.
 </p>
 <p>
  “These are the four major families. Even the Emperor must treat the family heads with respect.”

 <p>
  Neryssa’s explanation continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  I listened to the necessary parts and let the unnecessary ones pass. When she finished, I drew a conclusion.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, you’re saying that the place we visited was the Halkion Mansion?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s my guess, but I can’t be sure. The entrance to the mansion is the same, but the rest of the structure is completely different. I don’t know why it turned out that way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I agree with that point.
 </p>
 <p>
  Architecturally, such a mansion’s structure would be pointless.
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa took a deep breath and said with a serious expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I still don’t know why I’m on this mission, but I have a strange feeling that it’s connected to me. After examining the mission in detail with the regeneration stone, I became convinced. Don’t you think so? Or am I being delusional?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can’t say for sure since I don’t know.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If my words seemed disrespectful, I apologize.”
 </p>

 <p>
  I took a sip of water.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although not expressed, I knew that Jenna, Aaron, Edis, and other members of the waiting room were questioning the mission. We would find out the truth soon enough. I spoke up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is it said that the Golden Mansion consists of five floors?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “And you told me that the bloodline of the Four Great Families is mixed with the blood of monsters?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, but not any ordinary monsters. While it’s uncertain for Halkion, there are rumors of dragon’s blood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I took a sip of water.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Dragon’s blood.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The 20th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  A critical checkpoint in the Pick Me Up, a gateway that separates beginners from intermediate players.
 </p>

 <p>
  Users who pass the 20th floor are treated as accomplished Masters. But it’s not all sunshine and rainbows.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anyway, the 20th floor has one characteristic.
 </p>
 <p>
  The stage type is fixed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Boss battle.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The background and the type of enemies may differ, but every 20th floor has a boss.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not some run-of-the-mill ogre; these are unique monsters with unique abilities for each account. Of course, their strength surpasses that of regular large monsters.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first checkpoint of Pick Me Up is the 5th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here, one-third of the Masters are eliminated.
 </p>
 <p>
  The second checkpoint is on the 20th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here, more than half are eliminated. There were even Masters who couldn’t pass the 20th floor and vented their frustrations on the official café’s career counseling board.

 <p>
  “I witnessed you rescuing the princess on the 15th floor. However, it’s hard for me to understand why the Golden Mansion, something I’m connected to, suddenly appears now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I scratched my cheek.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike the heroes who simply carried out their assigned missions, Neryssa seemed to dig into the very purpose of the mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t know what your situation was there, but if you want out, tell me now. I don’t plan on taking anyone who doesn’t want to go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have no intention of leaving. I’d love to kill those bastards even though they don’t deserve my time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa smiled wryly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s a relief.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “All I can tell you ends here. I hope it was helpful.”

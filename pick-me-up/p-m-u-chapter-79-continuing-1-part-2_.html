 <p>
  The next day, in the morning.
 </p>
 <p>
  The members of the first party gathered at the training camp.
 </p>

 <p>
  I looked up.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sky was shimmering with a deep blue color. It was unusual for the Master to log in in the morning.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng sent the second party into the dungeon for the first time. The floor was 16th and above. It seemed like he was starting to train the sub-party now that the main party’s ascent was complete.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You know that the 20th floor is right in front, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I said, looking around at the members of the first party.
 </p>
 <p>
  All four nodded in unison.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I won’t say much. Increase the intensity of your training. We’ve been focusing on formations and cooperative training up until now, but now we’ll focus on improving individual abilities.”
 </p>
 <p>
  My current level was 18.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were two levels left until the maximum level for the 20th-floor section.
 </p>
 <p>
  But during the two level-ups, while climbing the 4th floor of the mansion, I couldn’t raise any skills. I had been busy getting the new member acclimated to the party and creating a new formation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We still have quite a bit of time. The second party isn’t that far either. We’ll need to clear the 18th floor repeatedly until the main members reach their level cap. We need to finish our preparations within that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The estimated period is about 10 days. I’ll tell each of you what you should do. Jenna, you first.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, Oppa.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “From now on, practice the longbow. If you can, request a suitable weapon from the crafting department. Focus solely on that until you learn the long bow skill.'”
 </p>
 <p>
  If dragonkin appear on the 20th floor, they are likely to have tough scales. A longbow capable of piercing it and skills to support it were essential. Jenna acknowledged with a reply.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Eloka, increase the power of your fire magic. If possible, up to level 4.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Level 4? It’s not easy…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m not forcing it. Just do your best.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Alright.”
 </p>
 <p>
  On the 20th floor, we would need high-powered magic, not just minor spells for dealing with pests.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka had significantly increased her magical power and the potency of her magic since her first arrival. I remembered her muttering that she might break through to the 4th level not long from now.
 </p>
 <p>
  After seeing Eloka nod, I spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Next, it’s the two of you. Do you need any separate instructions?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll handle that part on my own.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist nodded his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I have a few questions about some skills. I’d appreciate it if you could enlighten me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry about that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist, due to the research, could also access the skill window now.
 </p>

 <p>
  He seemed to be finding the right utilization of his wild, insight, and other skills lately. He could develop them as he pleased, unlike Jenna and Eloka, I could train them the way I wanted, but it didn’t match Velkist’s tendencies. So I decided to trust him with it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I plan to visit the Day Dungeon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lastly, it was Neryssa’s turn.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This time, I’ll prepare Extreme Poison, not Paralysis Poison. Since materials are different, it may take some time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is personal training not needed?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I think preparing the poison would be more beneficial than my training.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neryssa gave me a meaningful look.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps. Neryssa already had a sense of what the 20th floor entailed, even without me telling her. A golden mansion consisting of five floors. She must have already figured out what would come out on the final floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Poison, huh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The number of Weekly Dungeons is not high because the floor is low.
 </p>

 <p>
  But it wouldn’t be pointless. I accepted this too.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s no fixed schedule from today. Move freely. Just don’t be lazy. If you don’t want to die.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If I was going to be that sloppy, I wouldn’t have joined this party in the first place.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist picked up the sword sheath placed next to his chair.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s start right away. Fight me. With real weapons.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you talking about a fight this early in the morning?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s no morning or night in a fight, is there?”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘An interesting provocation.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled and reached for my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  This guy is quite interesting. Even if he loses to me several times, he doesn’t lose his spirit. His attitude is different from Aaron, Dica, or Asher.

  “I’m going to ask the guys there to make a longbow for me, okay?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sure. Also, order some thick arrows with it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If I ignore Anytng’s gaze, I could make it myself, but the equipment crafting department’s skills weren’t bad either. It should be fine to leave it to them for once. I didn’t stop Jenna.
 </p>
 <p>
  As I was about to go to the training grounds with Velkist, Eloka shouted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I want to join the duel too!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka was biting her lips.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If it’s real combat training, why do you always exclude me? I can fight too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But you said you didn’t want to?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I changed my mind. I don’t want to go into that weird storage anymore!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I hesitated for a moment.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-6" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  Until now, Eloka had not participated in the duels. She actively refused to join, and it was dangerous in itself. Flame magic doesn’t discriminate. Moreover, with her level and skill levels raised, her firepower was excessively strong now, and being hit directly by her magic could turn someone into ashes with a single blow.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you sure about this? I won’t go easy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s, it’s what I wanted.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka swallowed hard.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, I was planning to include her someday.’
 </p>
 <p>
  With this, Eloka was also included in the dueling members.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I want to fight with you alone, sumbae.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I ignored Velkist’s complaints with one ear.
 </p>
 <p>
  (T/N: guys do you prefer sumbae or senior, please tell me in the comments.)

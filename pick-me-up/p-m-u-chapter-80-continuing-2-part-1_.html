 <p>
  Rumble!
 </p>
 <p>
  Flames spread in all directions.
 </p>

 <p>
  The flames painted the iron bars red as they approached me. The heat burned my skin even with my flame resistance. However…
 </p>
 <p>
  I lightly stepped to the right and then leaped.
 </p>
 <p>
  The flames chased after me, but it was already too late. The blade of my sword touched Eloka’s neck. She gestured with an annoyed expression as the flames vanished.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re slow. Can’t you go faster?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You told me to increase the firepower, didn’t you? You even said you’d watch my back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I did say that, but there’s no harm in practicing, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled and sheathed my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  That was my tenth victory in a row. What I learned from our several duels was that Eloka was terrible in one-on-one combat. With the consistent increase in stats, the power of her magic had nearly doubled, but her control remained the same. Without any decent defensive spells, she relied on speed and seizing opportunities in a swift battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s time to learn chanting skills.’
 </p>
 <p>
  For Eloka in her current state, skills like High-speed Chanting or Multi-Cast were necessary.
 </p>
 <p>
  High-Speed Chanting would drastically reduce casting time, and Multi-Cast would allow her to mix telekinesis with fire magic for more versatility. It was a goal I had advised her on, and she agreed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Next is me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist, who had been standing outside the training ground, entered.
 </p>
 <p>
  He already had his sword drawn.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No breaks for you guys.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I thought you were watching, didn’t realize you were itching to join.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright, alright. Both of you, come at me. I don’t want to waste time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist glanced at Eloka and raised an eyebrow.
 </p>

 <p>
  “I don’t want to fight with a magician.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If Miss Nerissa doesn’t like it and you don’t like it either, then who should I fight with?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t care.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No need to be so snappy!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Both of them grumbled but got into position.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist had also acquired flame resistance a few days ago. At least now he wouldn’t be caught in Eloka’s magic.
 </p>
 <p>
  I readied myself.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Here I come.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist’s eyes sharpened.
 </p>
 <p>
  In an instant, his body scattered and dashed to the left. Simultaneously, the flames created by Eloka silently engulfed the right side. It might seem like a crude tactic, but the timing was precise. I raised my shield and awaited the approaching attacks.

 <p>
  After that, the morning’s training ended.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Skill Awakening!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Velkist (★★)’s ‘Basic Swordsmanship’ has reached Level 5!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist had raised his weapon skill level to 5.
 </p>
 <p>
  His growth rate was considerable. His talent was outstanding, and his effort matched it. His will and patience were strong. He was on the fast track.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s about time for me too.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Considerable time has passed since my weapon skill had reached level 7.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had a feeling that if given a little push, I would break through to level 8 and step into intermediate weapon skills.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was a significant gap between basic and intermediate weapon skills.
 </p>
 <p>
  Besides, weapon skills were the foundation of combat, along with a well-trained body. No matter how many fancy skills you had, without decent weapon skills, it was like an empty fortress.

 <p>
  Thwack!
 </p>
 <p>
  In the shooting range, Jenna was drawing her bow.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t the small bow she had been using until now but a large one that covered her entire upper body. Each time she pulled the string, a heavy sound reverberated. The arrows pierced the target more than 100 meters away with precision.
 </p>
 <p>
  The way she handled the bow was different from using a short bow.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna’s fingers were tired. She had been pulling the thick, large bowstring repeatedly, and it had caused blisters.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thwack!
 </p>
 <p>
  The second arrow hit dead center on the target.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her accuracy was close to sniping, precise, and sophisticated. No one had taught her this style, yet she had figured it out on her own. The power was no less than that of a crossbow. She would soon learn the skill of longbows.
 </p>
 <p>
  In one corner of the training field’s shelter, Aaron and Asher were fighting with spears and swords.
 </p>
 <p>
  Both of them had a weapon skill level of 4. Until this morning, they were on par with Velkist, but now they were lagging behind.

 <p>
  “This is quite mad.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist, who had been sitting in a chair, grinned.
 </p>
 <p>
  Besides improving his weapon skills, Velkist had also raised his insight level.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s all clear to me. I could beat you guys in under five minutes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t brag just because you went up once. You’ve still got a long way to go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, I suppose you’re right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The training ground on the second floor had only one arena.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since it’s something both parties use, we couldn’t monopolize it indefinitely. We’ve been taking turns using it over time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, most of the time, it’s us who use it.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is because the first party has already finished leveling up.

  I whispered to myself.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Status Window.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Han Israt (★★) Lv. 19 (Exp 42/150)]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Class: Novice]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Strength: 43/43]
 </p>
 <p>

  [Skills: Basic Swordsmanship (Lv.7), Insight (Lv.5), Flame Resistance (Lv.3), Pain Resistance (Lv.4), Composure (Lv.5), Frenzy (Lv.4), Stealth (Lv.1), Equestrianism (Lv.1)]
 </p>
 <p>
  My current level was 19.
 </p>

 <p>
  Strength exceeded 40, and health and agility were getting close to that mark.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flame resistance, composure, and frenzy had each gone up by one level.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was just one level away from reaching level 20, where 3-star advancement and class choices lay.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I applied pressure to the cup in my hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crackle.
 </p>
 <p>
  The cup, made of iron, crumpled like paper. I placed the crumpled cup on the table. It would return to its original shape if given some time.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a bit strange.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ever since I reached 2 stars, the growth stats had been oscillating between 5 and 6. 5 was the average for 3 stars, and 6 was the average for 4 stars. My overall stat accumulation was no longer that of a 2-star, something that other Masters would note as manipulation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Without attaching a sandbag of nearly 30 kg, it wasn’t considered exercise.
 </p>

 <p>
  My 100-meter dash record was approaching 8 seconds. I could do push-ups without getting tired. Up to this point, I had been near the limits of human physical capabilities, but now I was clearly surpassing them.
 </p>
 <p>
  And above all,
 </p>
 <p>
  Something felt different every time I swung my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  I realized it right after advancing to 2 stars. While using a sword and shield together used to feel natural, now it was becoming slightly unnatural.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Maybe it’s time to drop the shield.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The shield didn’t suit me.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was clear from the fact that I hadn’t learned any skills related to defense. Once we broke through the 20th floor and had some spare time, it seemed I would need to separate my skills.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Both parties, gather in the square!]

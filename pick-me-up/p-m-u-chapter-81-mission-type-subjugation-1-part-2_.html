 <p>
  Bang!
 </p>
 <p>
  I pushed the door with all my strength.
 </p>

 <p>
  A part of the door sunk in, and splinters of wood flew.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I entrusted my body to the darkness that spread beyond the door.
 </p>
 <p>
  The twisting darkness approached me and the members of Party 1.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  [Warning! Warning! Warning!]
 </p>
 <p>
  A loud siren blared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Along with the three-tiered warning message announcing a high-difficulty mission, the objective was updated.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Floor 20.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Mission Type – Subjugation]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Objective – Annihilate the designated enemy!]
 </p>
 <p>
  I glanced around.
 </p>
 <p>
  The place beyond the door was an unusual one entirely unrelated to the mansion.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Fine sand covered the floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Behind us, there is a tall wall that stretches for several meters. The wall extends in a long curve, surrounding us in a circular fashion. There were stairs leading up to the wall, but unexpectedly, a transparent barrier was erected.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ve ended up in another strange place.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna narrowed her gaze, arrow nocked in her longbow.

 <p>
  With the limit pulled taut, she was prepared to release an arrow at any moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  【La Gran Cedus.】
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka immediately initiated a chant.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although we couldn’t spot the enemy, it was essential to follow my orders.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a natural judgment.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, they would show themselves.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hehehe….”
 </p>
 <p>
  Somewhere, laughter echoed.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked toward the source of the sound. A man in a flashy red coat was staring at us. The man’s eyes had black veins coursing through them. A growling voice emanated from his lips.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Because of you…!”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Fire!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  An arrow shot from the longbow pierced through the man.
 </p>
 <p>
  With enhanced arrow power from the skill, it was more potent than most bullets. The man’s left torso was torn apart, and black blood sprayed out. Then, billowing flames engulfed his entire body. And,
 </p>
 <p>
  【Explode!】
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom! Boom! Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  The flames exploded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sand, propelled by the shock, soared into the sky and scattered in all directions. The sand particles swirled in the air, creating a temporary haze.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t stop shooting. Both of you, keep firing. I’ll go left. Velkist and Neryssa, go right. Let’s press him from both sides.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s the plan. They won’t get any mercy.”

 <p>
  Velkist chuckled and moved to the right, with Neryssa following closely behind.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I brandished my sword and took a step to the left. Simultaneously, I lowered my lower body and used the recoil to dash forward. In the haze of sand, crimson eyes flashed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kraaaaaah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A roar that made the air tremble.
 </p>
 <p>
  Amidst the swirling dust, the enemy’s figure was revealed.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, a unique monster has appeared!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tips/Sometimes there are rare monsters that exist as single individuals. Take note.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Useless tips.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Danger!]
 </p>
 <p>

 <p>
  Approximately 5 meters in size.
 </p>
 <p>
  A body resembling a lizard with wings and a tail. Shiny black scales covered its entire body. Vertically slitted red pupils locked onto me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  An arrow from Jenna’s longbow embedded itself in the black dragon’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  The arrow that had penetrated between the scales soon lost its strength and fell.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This monster is physically immune!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka’s magic followed suit.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flames augmented by telekinesis enveloped the dragon’s entire body and exploded simultaneously.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This monster is magically immune!]

 <p>
  A groan mixed with a metallic sound escaped the creature’s mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  I furrowed my brow and swung my sword with all my might at the exposed neck of the creature.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This monster is physically immune!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  A blue flame erupted, and the blade rebounded.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the opposite side, Velkist faced a similar situation. The tip of Velkist’s sword, aimed at the gaps in the scales, slid off uselessly.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This monster is physically immune!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The black dragon curled its body like a ball.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Get away from him!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I sheathed my sword and quickly retreated.

 <p>
  The dragon’s folded body expanded, and hundreds of sharp scales shot out in all directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This bastard…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Papapapak!
 </p>
 <p>
  Scales mercilessly pierced the nearby sand.
 </p>
 <p>
  I stepped back while using my sword to deflect the scales and shield to block them.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Neryssa (★★)’ is in a bleeding state. Health decreases periodically.]
 </p>
 <p>
  I glanced over.
 </p>
 <p>
  Blood was flowing from Neryssa’s left forearm. Velkist had resistance to ranged attacks, and Jenna and Eloka were at a distance, but Neryssa was in a precarious situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s okay. It’s nothing.”
 </p>

 <p>
  Neryssa quickly took out a potion and applied it to her wound.
 </p>
 <p>
  The black dragon continued to gaze at us from its position.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna’s arrow hit the crimson iris.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This monster is physically immune!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The thick arrow meant for a longbow fell like a slide onto the sand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “W-What is that? It doesn’t seem to be affected by anything!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna opened her mouth in surprise.
 </p>
 <p>
  I moved towards Eloka and Jenna.
 </p>
 <p>
  “For now, let’s regroup.”
 </p>
 <p>
  All members of the first party gathered in one place.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist spoke with a frustrated expression, his gaze fixed on the creature.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Neither swords nor arrows work. Magic seems useless too. Are its scales that tough?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not that they’re tough. It just doesn’t seem to be affected.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you mean?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No matter how much we attack, it seems to have no effect.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If it had physical immunity, it would ignore any kind of attack.
 </p>
 <p>
  That was immunity. Magic was the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do we do then? There seems to be no way!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll discuss it later. Here it comes. Prepare!”

 <p>
  Charrung!
 </p>
 <p>
  Claws measuring 50cm in length emerged from the black dragon’s hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka’s complexion turned pale.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kraaaaaah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Like a snake crawling on the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  The black dragon approached, digging the sand with its claws.

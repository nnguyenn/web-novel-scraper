 <p>
  His incredible speed defied his sturdy build.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Black Dragon closed the 10-meter gap in the blink of an eye. Its outstretched left hand, tipped with claws, writhed behind it. I strengthened my grip on the shield in my hand.

 <p>
  “Velkist.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I know!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  Its thick left hand swung like a log.
 </p>
 <p>
  I lowered my posture and held the shield in front of me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kaboom!
 </p>
 <p>
  The shield crumpled instantly, and blade marks marred its surface.
 </p>
 <p>
  An overwhelming shock surged as if it could throw my whole body off balance. To avoid falling, I had to step back a few paces. At the same time, its right hand swung. Velkist and Neryssa were right behind it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swish!
 </p>
 <p>
  As the flames hit the Black Dragon’s face while we were trying to intercept its attack, a message appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This monster is immune to magic!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Next, the tail!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I retrieved the shield and quickly moved backward.
 </p>
 <p>
  The tail extended upward like a scorpion’s and swept forward. It passed like a blade over Velkist’s prostrate head, sending a few strands of his hair flying.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What can we do if our attacks don’t work?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!
 </p>
 <p>
  Its right claw raked the area where Velkist had been.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist rolled rapidly on the ground to get out of range. I struck out with my sword at the outstretched left hand, which was aiming for Velkist. There was a strong rebound.

 <p>
  Ping ping ping ping!
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna switched to a short bow and fired arrows relentlessly, but they had no effect. The shattered arrow fragments fell lifelessly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Black Dragon’s left hand swung again.
 </p>
 <p>
  I twisted my body to narrowly evade it. Each finger had long, sharp claws. Its attack range was not ordinary. The right hand was the same. The scales on its tail stood like blades.
 </p>
 <p>
  I moved back significantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Black Dragon’s mouth opened, and it bit down on the spot where I had been standing. Teeth like gears were revealed inside its jaws, shining white. At the same time, the left hand, right hand, and tail; the creature used its entire body as a weapon to drive us back.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The target of its attacks…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I analyzed the creature’s attack pattern.
 </p>
 <p>
  The main targets were me and Velkist. It tended to deal with those in front first. It hadn’t touched Jenna and Eloka. I said to them while avoiding its claws.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jenna, Eloka, stay as far away from me as possible.”

 <p>
  “Alright!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The two of them hurriedly moved away.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You guys too, go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The left and right hands swung together. Ten claws swept through the entire area.
 </p>
 <p>
  I deflected two of the claws with my shield and sword, then slipped into the exposed gap. The sand stirred by the claws shot up into the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you mean by saying, go?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It means what it exactly means!  I’m the only one dealing with this bastard.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What? Are you kidding?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Crash!
 </p>
 <p>
  I stopped the tailing that was targeting Velkist with my sword.

 <p>
  Neryssa, who was behind Velkist, threw a poisoned dagger. The dagger aimed at the gap in the scales bounced off.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This monster is physically immune!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “This guy has a tendency to only attack one person. It’s a waste of stamina if everyone sticks to him. And….”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the scales of a black dragon stuck in the corner of the field.
 </p>
 <p>
  Black energy leaked from the scales. The black energy swelled like smoke and took the shape of a human. It’s said to have a human form, but its appearance was very blurry.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Corrupted Shadow Lv. 14]
 </p>
 <p>
  “You guys have other things to do.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The shadow’s hands had black claws.
 </p>
 <p>
  Black smoke was also billowing from other scales embedded in the sand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist looked at them and clicked his tongue.

  “Okay, I understand. Can you hold on while we deal with those guys?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. There is definitely be….”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kwasik!
 </p>
 <p>
  The claws slammed into the shield.
 </p>
 <p>
  My shoulders creaked. I continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  “……A way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll leave it to you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s go.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Belquist and Nerissa escaped.
 </p>
 <p>
  The shadow gathered quickly near the two.
 </p>

 <p>
  Eloka clutched her forehead.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s this now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist’s sword pierced the head of the shadow.
 </p>
 <p>
  The shadow writhed and then disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Our attacks work on them. Let’s deal with them quickly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We just need to hold on until the opportunity comes!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna’s expression hardened as she nocked an arrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  The four of them gathered in one place and formed a formation. Velkist and Neryssa were at the front, Jenna and Eloka at the rear. It was a formation we had practiced in case I was absent. They began dealing with the gathering shadows one by one.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They’re doing well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t just some casual training.

 <p>
  Even in what seemed like a hopeless situation, they were handling it calmly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Physically immune. Magic immune.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kraaah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Black Dragon let out a roar.
 </p>
 <p>
  Its body spun like a top. Not just its claws, tail, and teeth, but each sharp scale was no different from a deadly weapon. The scattered sand flew in all directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang!
 </p>
 <p>
  I deflected the claws with my shield and took a few steps back. I lowered my upper body. The tail swept past me. I moved sideways. Its jaws closed. Now it was attacking only me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I prefer it this way.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it were to aggro on Eloka, whose defense was lower, it would be more troublesome. I dodged and deflected attacks while analyzing its pattern.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Scales launch. Physical Melee attacks. Summon minions.”

 <p>
  The bosses of Pick Me Up had certain phases and patterns.
 </p>
 <p>
  This creature showed just three patterns: launching scales, wielding claws and tail, and summoning minions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not that complicated.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If we ignore the fact that it’s completely immune to all attacks, we can handle it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kraaaah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Black Dragon roared right in front of me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I felt intense pressure in my ears. I thrust my sword into its throat.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This monster is physically immune!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Still, this is a pain.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled despite it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Its claws grazed my thigh.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it weren’t for the reinforced plates and leather, my flesh would have been torn apart like paper.
 </p>
 <p>
  “[Han (★★)] has entered a bleeding state. Health will decrease at regular intervals.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I jumped back and sheathed my sword. Then I pulled out a potion and sprayed it on the wound. I tossed the empty glass bottle carelessly. The creature was approaching.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We can’t hold out for long.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Not me, nor the others.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sufficient” means we won’t die right away, not that it’s easy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang! Clang! Clang!
 </p>
 <p>
  The claws struck, and each blow made my shield crumple.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it had been an ordinary shield from the workshop, it would have been destroyed already. My left arm joint throbbed painfully. The tail brushed against my side. The leather armor was torn away.
 </p>

 <p>
  Attacks don’t work.
 </p>
 <p>
  And it’s not easy to dodge, let alone block. One blow is like an artillery shell. If my equipment was subpar or my stats weren’t good, I would have been minced long ago. Left hand, right hand, head, and tail. I defended while looking for gaps in its patterns, but…
 </p>
 <p>
  [[Han (★★)] has entered a bleeding state. Health will decrease at regular intervals.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The second bleeding message appeared.

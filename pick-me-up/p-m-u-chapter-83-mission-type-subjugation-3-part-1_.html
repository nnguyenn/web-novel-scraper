 <p>
  Claws struck from left and right.
 </p>
 <p>
  I raised my sword and shifted my left foot to the side. The blade met the claws, sending sparks flying.

 <p>
  Kaga!
 </p>
 <p>
  An ominous sound echoed through the sword’s hilt. I couldn’t predict when the sword’s durability would run out.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Diran, focus on the crossbowmen!”
 </p>
 <p>
  On top of the fortress wall, Edis was in the midst of commanding the battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  Following Edis’s orders, the archer targeted the crossbowmen. Edis, jumping high, also cut the throat of one crossbowman.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hold on just a bit longer! We’ll break through soon!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis shouted while looking at us below.
 </p>
 <p>
  She realized that prolonging the battle would make it tougher for us. The formation prioritized speed over stability. Side by side, Aaron and Roderick’s spears swept through the soldiers like a windmill.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What will happen if the 2nd party reaches that place?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Fwhoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka spoke while casting fire.
 </p>
 <p>
  Two shadows, engulfed in flames, fell.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s definitely going to be different from before. Focus!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I tightened my grip on the sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  The members of the 1st party, standing in a circle, held their positions. Around them, a dozen or so shadows closed in. I tore through the shadows with my sword and said,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Until the 2nd party reaches the altar, deal with all the shadows. Got it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We need some magic.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, a level 3 spell.”

 <p>
  “Understood. Give me some casting time!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna drew her dagger and stood behind Eloka.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a triangle centered around Eloka. It pierced through the shadows where long swords, short swords, and daggers gathered.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kraaa!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Noisy bastard!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The black dragon opened its mouth wide, trying to bite me.
 </p>
 <p>
  I twisted my shoulder to avoid it and struck its eye with my elbow.
 </p>
 <p>
  [This monster is immune to physical attacks!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Pain like crushing concrete shot through my elbow.
 </p>
 <p>
  I frowned. I have seen this message many times. But there wasn’t much time left. I looked at the wall behind me.

 <p>
  “The 2nd party hasn’t been idling either.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis and Roderick were at the forefront, cleaning up the soldiers.
 </p>
 <p>
  The 2nd party passed over the fortress wall. In their wake, the bodies of soldiers piled up. The distance to the altar was less than 10 meters.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ignite!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The surging flames swept the shadows away.
 </p>
 <p>
  Under Velkist and Neryssa’s guidance, the shadows gathered in one place.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Explode!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Kwa-kwa-kwa-boom!
 </p>
 <p>
  The flames exploded in unison. Sand rose high into the sky, and the intense heat reached us.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Sublimate!]
 </p>

 <p>
  Thwack!
 </p>
 <p>
  A pillar of fire erupted from the center of the explosion.
 </p>
 <p>
  The three members of the 1st party quickly retreated with Eloka. The swirling shadows were more than 20. She annihilated all of them in one go.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hah…!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka gasped for breath.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her face had turned pale.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Sister, drink this!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna rummaged through Eloka’s pouch and handed her a mana potion.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka nodded and guzzled down the potion.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The cleanup is done.”
 </p>

 <p>
  The shadows wouldn’t appear for a while.
 </p>
 <p>
  The only enemy left was this guy. I hit the tail, which bent like a whip, with my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Grrrr!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The soldier blocking the altar had his throat split, blood spewing out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis twirled the blood-soaked dagger. This guy was the last one.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Han, what should we do now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Place your hand on the altar!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis placed her hand on the goddess statue.
 </p>

 <p>
  The red light that had been circling the altar began to turn white.
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘2nd Party’ has occupied the altar.]
 </p>
 <p>
  The black dragon’s tail and claws swiped.
 </p>
 <p>
  The armor on its shoulders was torn, and blood flowed. I caught my breath and stepped back. Velkist followed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now I’ll join the boss fight too!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not your choice, I will make you do that even if you don’t want to.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled.
 </p>
 <p>
  With sound effects, a hologram window appeared in my field of vision.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The altar’s effect is applied.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, the blessing of the goddess is now available!]

 <p>
  [Slide the crystal! Bestow holy power upon the hero!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Wings unfolded behind the black dragon’s back.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sharp thorns sprouted at the tips of its wings. The black dragon swung its tail and wings simultaneously.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist swung his sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment, the screen was covered.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Ding!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Applied successfully!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Sacred power is imbued in the hero’s weapon!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Shaaak!
 </p>
 <p>
  The membrane of the wings tore apart. Crimson blood splattered on the ground.
 </p>

 <p>
  The black dragon staggered back.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist furrowed his brow.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist’s sword, which he held in his right hand, was shining white. My sword was the same. The same light lingered on Jenna’s dagger, Eloka’s quiver, and Neryssa’s rapier.
 </p>
 <p>
  I aimed my sword at the black dragon.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The time to deal with that bastard has come.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It seems so.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist chuckled.

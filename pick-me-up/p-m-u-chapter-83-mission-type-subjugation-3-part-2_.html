  I aimed my sword at the black dragon.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The time to deal with that bastard has come.”

 <p>
  “It seems so.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  The black dragon took a few steps back and glared at us.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Grrrr…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The boiling sound of its throat suddenly stopped.
 </p>
 <p>
  Scales all over its body began to stand on end.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Scales launch. Get ready!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pabababak!
 </p>
 <p>
  The second round of scales fired.
 </p>
 <p>
  I leaned my shoulder against Velkist. I deflected the left scales, while Velkist deflected the right ones. Neryssa and Jenna, who were farther away, protected Eloka as they stepped back.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sssrrr.
 </p>
 <p>
  And just as expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Corrupted Shadow Lv. 14] X ???
 </p>
 <p>
  Shadows began to rise from the scales embedded in the sand.
 </p>
 <p>
  We retreated to our base once more. I wiped the scale fragments off my sword and said,
 </p>
 <p>
  “As you can see, our attacks work on it now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But it doesn’t look easy. Oppa, what’s your plan?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We split the party into two groups. One for the boss and one for the shadows. We’ll switch roles as we fight.”

 <p>
  As the shadows piled up, it would become a burden to fight both the black dragon and the shadows.
 </p>
 <p>
  We needed to adjust to a reasonable number. However, considering the formation, it would be difficult to deal with both the shadows and the black dragon simultaneously. We had to divide our numbers wisely.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m group 1. Velkist and Neryssa, you’re group 2. Jenna and Eloka, group 3.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Groups 1 and 2 will take turns fighting the dragon. Group 3 will provide rear support. Group 2 will start first. I need a break.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The shadows were numerous but not particularly strong.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, facing the black dragon would consume a lot of stamina. We needed to take turns fighting him.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Understood.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ll handle it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Start now.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I swung my sword and severed the neck of the shadow that had been lurking nearby.
 </p>

 <p>
  Velkist and Neryssa rushed the black dragon from both sides. Velkist’s sword tip shot out like a beam of light, piercing the dragon’s shoulder. Black blood spurted from the gap in its scales.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Still not that easy.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Immunity may have been nullified, but the scales were tough, and the skin was thick.
 </p>
 <p>
  If we could kill it in one go, all five of us would rush in and finish it off, but judging from the situation, we had to prepare for a long battle. I picked off one shadow at a time with Jenna, who had her back to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can’t afford to leave them alone.’
 </p>
 <p>
  As I looked toward the altar, a bitter smile formed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Knock the ladders down! Don’t let them climb up!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis shouted. Ladders were hung over the walls.
 </p>
 <p>
  Enemies from the other side were gathering. They were either raising ladders against the walls or crawling up to rush the altar.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The time they can hold out for is limited.’

 <p>
  They couldn’t hold them off indefinitely.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sooner or later, our defenses would be breached, and the altar’s occupation would be lifted. We had prepared for a protracted battle, but we didn’t have much time to spare.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kraaaaa!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The black dragon roared, dripping blood from all over its body.
 </p>
 <p>
  Velkist and Neryssa continued to attack from both sides.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jenna, stop using the dagger. Shoot the dragon with your longbow. I can handle the shadows alone.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll take care of it!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna pulled out her longbow and took aim.
 </p>
 <p>
  Behind her, Eloka was downing mana potions. I slashed three shadows in one go with my sword. I also grabbed a potion and drank it immediately.
 </p>
 <p>
  Tang!

 <p>
  An arrow pierced through the air and penetrated the black dragon’s body.
 </p>
 <p>
  The arrowhead, embedded deep into its roots, quivered. Black blood splattered in all directions. Velkist’s sword, shining like light, pierced the dragon’s wing again. I finished off the remaining shadows one by one.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Velkist, Neryssa, chane with me! Drink the potion as soon as you get back!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks to emptying the entire potion, my stamina recovered to some extent.
 </p>
 <p>
  I stepped on the floor and ran towards the black dragon. Velkist and Neryssa retreated.
 </p>
 <p>
  The black dragon’s eyes caught me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Catch this.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I drew the dagger with my left hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  The blade was poisoned, capable of killing in a matter of minutes.

 <p>
  Qwic!
 </p>
 <p>
  The thrown dagger lodged itself in the vertical pupil of the dragon’s left eye. Black blood oozed from its eyelid.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can’t use Frenzy yet.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Once used, it’s difficult to reverse.
 </p>
 <p>
  I have to reserve my Frenzy for the finishing blow. I twirled my body and swung my sword. From the side, claws descended, and the sword blade gleamed white. The severed claw of the black dragon was stuck in the castle wall. I grabbed the dagger hilt embedded in the left eye of the black dragon and pulled it to the side.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Grwaaaah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The dragon roared fiercely, lifting its neck.
 </p>
 <p>
  Blood, now tinged with purple, flowed down its eyelid.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Han! We can’t hold on much longer!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Edis shouted urgently.

  I glanced quickly at the top of the castle wall. Beyond the altar, dozens of soldiers had already entered. Asher and Aaron were blocking the narrow path.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I know.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Kwack!
 </p>
 <p>
  As I jumped sideways, the tail struck the sand. I swung my sword towards the tail, but it only left a small cut; there was no significant injury.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I lack a decisive blow.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I bit my lip.
 </p>
 <p>
  The black dragon had significant injuries, but I hadn’t dealt a critical blow to stop it yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  The vulnerable points of a dragon are commonly two: the throat or the heart. However, the skin around its neck and heart is particularly thick and tough. Blood was oozing from various parts of its body, but it was still insufficient.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Uwaaah!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the castle wall.

  [‘Asher (★★)’ is in a bleeding state. Health decreases periodically.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Gasp, ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  A spear was embedded in Usher’s abdomen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Foam mixed with blood flowed from his mouth. Edis’s face stiffened rapidly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Pull him back!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron bent over and pulled Usher back from the front line. Roderick took his place. Emergency treatment with potions began.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I-Isn’t this dangerous?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eloka exclaimed.
 </p>
 <p>
  I furrowed my brow. We reached the limit faster than expected.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘In the end, there’s only one option: take the gamble.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If we lost the altar, it would be a total defeat.
 </p>
 <p>
  The remaining four members of the two parties could hold out for a long time, maybe around 5 minutes at most. I was prepared to call Velkist and Neryssa. Whether it worked or not.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kugugugung!
 </p>
 <p>
  At that moment, a violent vibration shook the field.
 </p>
 <p>
  I pinpointed the source of the vibration. A tower was rising from a corner on the opposite side of the castle wall where the two parties were.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Field configuration complete!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, rear support is now available.]
 </p>
 <p>
  At the top of the tower, a ballista with thick arrows was positioned.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Selecting rear support.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Designated parties – ‘1st party (in battle),’ ‘2nd party (in battle),’ ‘3rd party’…]

 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  As the light shone, a short-haired girl walked out.
 </p>
 <p>
  She held a sword and shield in both hands. Sharn Eionor. She was the leader of the 3rd party, replacing Velkist.
 </p>
 <p>
  Following her, the members of the 3rd party were being summoned one by one.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sharn blinked and then looked around.

 <p>
  “Run to the tower!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kraaaaa!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The black dragon howled.
 </p>
 <p>
  I leaped backward. Claws overturned the sand. I spat out the sand that had entered my mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t you see it? Go up the tower! Aim that ballista at this freaking lizard!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, oh, okay!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sharn rushed to the castle wall. Behind her, members of the 3rd party followed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Next to them, ladders were hanging.

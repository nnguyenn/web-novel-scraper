  The evening after clearing the 20th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Welcome to Pick Me Up!]

 <p>
  Anytng logged in.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Loading complete.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [T O U C H! (Select)]
 </p>
 <p>
  I placed the file in the drawer and stood up. Inside the file, I had written down the record of clearing the 20th floor. It was for reference in case a similar mission came up in the future. When Anytng touched the screen, the game’s main screen appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  A message appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, there’s a hero waiting for promotion!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Promotion eligible hero – ‘Han (★★)’]
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the message box sparkling in green.
 </p>
 <p>
  With yesterday’s clear, my level had reached 20. This meant I was eligible for a 3-star promotion. However, a 3-star promotion required slightly rarer materials than a 2-star promotion.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tips for Master who cleared the 20th floor!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tips/To promote to 3 stars, you need ‘Intermediate Promotion Stones.’ ‘Intermediate Promotion Stones’ can be crafted by combining ‘Low-Rank Promotion Stones’ and ‘Low-Rank Soul Stones.’ Remember that!]
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like Iselle was doing her job.
 </p>
 <p>
  After finishing the now-cold tea, I left the room. When I entered the plaza, Iselle was in the process of moving a cart with items.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Oh, you’re here?]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle waved at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [These are mementos from the ones who died this time. Cups and dolls they used. Nothing special.]
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked to the left of the plaza.
 </p>

 <p>
  The storage room door was open, and beyond it, I could see the backs of Edis and Roderick.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Indeed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like they were tidying up after the battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  Minimal mourning would still be necessary for the future. Next to the storage room, Jenna was leaning against the wall. She approached me with a shy smile.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you up to?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was thinking about going in. It looked serious, so I held back.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at the contents of the cart.
 </p>
 <p>
  The wooden cups with jagged edges were Asher’s belongings. He had a hobby of carving. The doll was probably from the archer who died this time. The details were unclear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna murmured.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nothing here belongs to the 3rd party, huh?”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Because they couldn’t make it to the 2nd floor.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s a bit unfortunate.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As the cart entered, the storage room’s door closed.
 </p>
 <p>
  I shifted my gaze. I didn’t have much to do. Anytng, who had stored Asher and Diran’s mementos, started his next task. He touched the facility tab.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You have selected the ‘Transformation Chamber,’ an auxiliary building of the ‘Synthesis Chamber.’ Will you build it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes (selected) / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  Kururur.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was a vibration from the direction of the Synthesis Chamber.
 </p>
 <p>
  [The Transformation Chamber is complete! Now you can transform heroes.]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Good!]
 </p>

 <p>
  [The Promotion Chamber has evolved to Level 2! Synthesis efficiency has increased.]
 </p>
 <p>
  I sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What about you, Jenna?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t know. It’s a bit dull to train. I think I’ll go to the lounge. They say there are games like chess there.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then go ahead.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What about you, Oppa?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m a bit busy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  With a puzzled look, Jenna entered the dormitory.
 </p>
 <p>
  Alone now, I sat on a bench on the 2nd-floor plaza. After a while, through the transparent floor, I saw Iselle bringing someone out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thunk.
 </p>

 <p>
  The Synthesis Chamber’s door opened, but the message was different.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, Transformation is starting!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Tips/’Transformation’ tab is now open. Try transforming heroes to obtain various materials!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Transformation.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s the second way to make use of useless heroes since in some cases the level difference between the subject and the offering diminishes the merit of synthesis.
 </p>
 <p>
  The man screamed and struggled, but he couldn’t hold out for long. He was thrust into the Synthesis Chamber. The door closed tightly. A moment later.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Good!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Transformation complete!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You have obtained ‘Low-Rank Soul Stones’!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng obtained the soul stones, the material for the 3-star promotion.
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-6" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 <p>
  I knew the guy who had just transformed.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was one of those guys who did nothing despite the separation of the upper and lower floors and discrimination in consciousness. It was one of those cases where there was no value even in synthesis.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s a pleasant sight.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  The negligence in the eyes of the people in the 1st floor plaza who had been chattering earlier had disappeared. They hurriedly left for the training hall and armory. I stared at the message box that appeared next.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Item synthesis in progress!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Selected materials – Low-Rank Attribute Stones, Low-Rank Soul Stones]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Completed item – Intermediate Promotion Stone]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Success rate – 91%]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Synthesis method – Automatic]
 </p>

 <p>
  [Do you want to proceed with the synthesis?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  *Kudungtangtang!*
 </p>
 <p>
  *Fairy power!*
 </p>
 <p>
  *Good!*
 </p>
 <p>
  *Synthesis complete!*
 </p>
 <p>
  “You have obtained ‘Intermediate Promotion Stone’!”
 </p>
 <p>
  I sat on the bench and watched the messages appearing one by one.
 </p>
 <p>
  It didn’t take long for Iselle to bring out the Intermediate Promotion Stone. Although it had a similar color to the Low-Rank Promotion Stone, it was of a different size. I accepted the fist-sized stone and put it in my pouch. The door to the 2nd-floor Synthesis Chamber opened, and I spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is the second time, huh?”
 </p>

 <p>
  [Since there are up to 7 stars, you only need to do it four more times!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “But seriously, Iselle, how much interference have you accumulated? I want to have a showdown with the master.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Oh, that…!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Sweat dripped from Iselle’s temple.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Did you use it all!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [No! I just watched MuTube a bit!]
 </p>
 <p>
  “What happened to surfing the web?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yeah, well… But I can’t help it. There are too many heroes! Work, work, work all day! I end up looking haggard. Stress keeps piling up! People die from overwork you know!]
 </p>
 <p>
  The workload was indeed quite heavy.
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled. When Antyng logged in, Iselle never stopped moving. I agreed that Iselle needed some leisure time too.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It doesn’t matter if it’s not that much. I just need it for a little bit. When you finish promoting, we’ll start right away.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Well…]
 </p>
 <p>
  Iselle narrowed her eyes and placed her hand on her chin. Then she circled around in her spot.
 </p>
 <p>
  [It should be about 30 minutes of internet access time. I’ve mentioned it before, but writing emails or posting on forums reduces the time.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s fine. Get ready.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I stood up from the bench and walked to the Synthesis Chamber.
 </p>
 <p>
  The second door inside the Synthesis Chamber was open. I entered one after another. When I placed the Promotion Stone on the altar in the center of the room, a red light enveloped my body.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Master, the promotion begins!]

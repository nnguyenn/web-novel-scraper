 <p>
  I explained the basic rules of Pick Me Up to Jenna.
 </p>
 <p>
  The existence of a master who gives us orders. We have to subdue enemies and fulfill missions according to those orders. With each completed mission, the floor level increases, and when we reach the 100th floor, we might be liberated.

 <p>
  “We have to fight monsters all the time?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s why we train. We have to grow stronger.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Besides training, there are various ways to become stronger, but at the current low floor level, most of the content is still locked. At this point, training is all I can do.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do we have to keep fighting alone?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I also explained about summoning. The master summons humans from another world using gems and gold as currency. We were brought to this world through that summoning.
 </p>
 <p>
  People will continue to be summoned steadily, and we have to perform missions while sometimes competing and sometimes cooperating with them.
 </p>
 <p>
  I kept the world and my true identity hidden.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is all I can explain. Did you understand?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, I got it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna nodded her head. Her expression wasn’t particularly good, but she didn’t openly show it. She was concealing her emotions.
 </p>
 <p>
  She didn’t act like a kid about it, there were no signs of tantrums or misbehavior.
 </p>
 <p>
  She was calmly accepting the situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘She’s reliable enough.’
 </p>
 <p>
  “We are in it together, right?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We are in it together? What do you mean?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If I die, you die, and if you die, hyung, I’ll die.”
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s not it.
 </p>
 <p>
  But she’s showing goodwill.

 <p>
  I didn’t explain about synthesis either, but maybe for another time.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anyway, the master will be back soon, and then the battle will begin. Until then, keep training. It’s better than being idle.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna saluted loudly and raised her longbow.
 </p>
 <p>
  Training resumed once again. There was nothing special about the training itself; it mainly involved physical conditioning and swinging swords at scarecrows or shooting arrows.
 </p>
 <p>
  But neither Jenna nor I were playing around.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our lives were at stake.
 </p>
 <p>
  After a day of training.
 </p>
 <p>
  The reason why I couldn’t find Jenna in the dormitory was revealed.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I opened the door to the dormitory, a modern-style house appeared, but when Jenna opened the door, it revealed the interior of a quaint wooden house. When I asked Iselle about it, she replied like this.

 <p>
  [Do you have any complaints? Be thankful you’re not stuck in a barn!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Since I had no complaints about my living conditions, I didn’t argue with Jenna either. It seemed that the location changed depending on who opened the door.
 </p>
 <p>
  And so, on the third day of training.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Welcome to Pick Me Up!]
 </p>
 <p>
  I stopped swinging my wooden sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  The straw-stuffed scarecrow was in tatters.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Status window.’

  [Skills: Low-level Swordsmanship (Lv.1), Low-level Shield Techniques (Lv.1)]
 </p>
 <p>
  I acquired two skills. Low-level Swordsmanship and Low-level Shield Techniques, which enhance sword and shield abilities, respectively. Jenna’s Low-level Archery skill had increased to level 2.
 </p>
 <p>
  We did what we could.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Get ready. The master is coming.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Already?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you mean ‘already’? It’s been three days.”
 </p>
 <p>
  We returned our weapons and went to the square.

 </p>
 <p>
  “I am the Strategy King! Check out the official café…”
 </p>
 <p>
  The announcements were skipped, and the master appeared on the main screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  I calculated the time ratio between Earth and the waiting room. If the master logs in here every day, one day on Earth is equivalent to three days here.
 </p>
 <p>
  The summoning gate opened.
 </p>
 <p>

  All 1-star heroes.
 </p>
 <p>
  A faint light seeped out from inside the summoning gate.
 </p>
 <p>
  After a moment, three men walked out with bewildered faces.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where is this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s what I’m saying.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey, mister! Get ready to fight first. I’ll teach you after it’s over!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re talking about getting ready to fight? Who are you? Answer!”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Forming a party.]

 <p>
  [Drag and drop heroes!]

 </p>
 <p>
  Creak.
 </p>
 <p>
  The front door opened.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the same time, the door to the armory opened.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was much faster than the previous round.
 </p>
 <p>
  The master was in a rush.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jenna, get your weapons before it’s too late!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes!”
 </p>
 <p>
  We ran.

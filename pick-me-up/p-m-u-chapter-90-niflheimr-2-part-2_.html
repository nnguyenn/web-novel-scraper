  “This old man is not very friendly…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Thud!

 <p>
  Eldarkin’s figure blurred for an instant, and then blood and broken teeth flew from the man’s face.
 </p>
 <p>
  The man couldn’t even scream before collapsing. Eldarkin stared at the writhing man on the ground with emotionless eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Fast.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t even see it with my own eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t surprising. A senior instructor had to be at least level 70 or higher. The four people standing beside Eldarkin weren’t to be underestimated either. Even if all hundred people here rushed in, they wouldn’t stand a chance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna narrowed her eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I didn’t see it. That guy is really strong.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stronger than me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Than you, Oppa?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Isn’t that obvious?!”
 </p>
 <p>
  In Townia, I might be considered invincible, but I was only a 3-star, level 20 rookie.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s just the truth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, don’t mess with them and obey their orders.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s a good idea. They’re scary people.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eldarkin kicked the man to the elevator and pushed him in.
 </p>
 <p>
  The recruits fell silent like they had hit the jackpot.
 </p>
 <p>
  “One by one, please board.”
 </p>
 <p>
  There were five prepared elevators.
 </p>

 <p>
  The three of us boarded the middle one. When Eldarkin finally got on, the doors closed. I muttered looking at Eldarkin, standing straight,
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Status window.’
 </p>
 <p>
  [Beep!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [You cannot view the hero’s status window.]
 </p>
 <p>
  As expected, they had security measures in place.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, it didn’t matter if I couldn’t see it. I had a rough idea of his stats.
 </p>
 <p>
  I moved to a corner of the elevator.
 </p>
 <p>
  Between the rear of the elevator and the glass wall, I could see Niflheimr’s scenery.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dozens of diverse facilities. Streets and roads paved with bricks. Heroes of various ages and genders. The square I had personally designed was bustling with countless people.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hundreds of heroes on the 5th-floor square.
 </p>

 <p>
  I looked back on my memories and recited the impressions and names that came to mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I don’t know most of them.’
 </p>
 <p>
  In the end, I laughed.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were over 20,000 heroes affiliated with Niflheimr.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how you looked at it, there was no way to remember them all.
 </p>
 <p>
  The elevator began to move.
 </p>
 <p>
  The view of the 5th-floor square receded upward.
 </p>
 <p>
  The elevator arrived at the 2nd floor and came to a stop.
 </p>
 <p>
  We followed Eldarkin along the brick-paved road as instructed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The 2nd floor of Niflheim.”

 <p>
  Here, there were summoning chambers and training facilities.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked beyond the walls on either side of the road. High-rise buildings stretched high into the sky. Jenna and Aaron were amazed. When they started to get a little tired of being impressed, a vast training ground appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Line up in rows of 10 and stand in the training ground. The director will be here soon, so please remain quiet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That darn 5 and 10… Ugh!”
 </p>
 <p>
  The woman who had been complaining suddenly sat down.
 </p>
 <p>
  She was sweating profusely and seemed unable to get up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that intimidating?”
 </p>
 <p>
  One of Eldarkin’s top-level skills.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eldarkin looked at the woman lying on the ground and then entered a building outside the training ground. When he disappeared, a young man with a bad impression spat out,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Listen. Do you really think following their instructions will make you stronger?”
 </p>

 <p>
  “You won’t regret it. As long as you follow my orders.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The female instructor smiled slyly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Although Eldarkin told you to line up in rows of ten, he doesn’t expect perfection. You can be at ease and maintain discipline.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The four instructors withdrew to the rear of the training ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  I gazed at the high platform in front of me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “To think I’d be doing this even after leaving Earth…”
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t help but smile bitterly.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was something I had already experienced several times in school and in the military.
 </p>
 <p>
  And a little later,
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Welcome, everyone.&gt;
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  A voice echoed throughout the training ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the platform, a woman in uniform stood silently.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;I am Eclet Pardisa, the Training Director responsible for all education in Niflheimr.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  The woman, with her dark hair tied back, wore a black uniform with a gold coat over it. She had a blue sword at her waist. Judging by appearances, she was in her late twenties, but since heroes don’t age, her exact age couldn’t be determined.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This woman…’
 </p>
 <p>
  Rank 9.
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the elite personnel of the 12th floor, just below the five on the 13th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;From now on, you will receive appropriate training from us for your missions. However, we won’t force you. You are free to do nothing and leave. We will do our best, but the choice to receive training or not is up to you.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna raised an eyebrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eclet smiled meaningfully.
 </p>

 <p>
  &lt;You are guests, just like I once was.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is she talking about?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m not sure.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I had a rough idea, though.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eclet pointed to the man at the front.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;You.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “Me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;How many airships are there in your territory?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “We have two…”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;In Niflheimr, there are a total of 427 airships. That’s about a 210-fold difference.&gt;
 </p>

 <p>
  The man’s face turned red and blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What do you mean? Are you making fun of me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;If you compare your power in detail…&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Eclet’s lips curved.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;There’s a gap of about 3,000 times.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;As you know, you are all expected from your Master. However…&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Eclet said.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Is the Master meeting your expectations? Is your Master so outstanding that you would willingly sacrifice your life for them?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  “What…”
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;I asked if you could compare your Master to Lord Loki.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That’s how it is.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Somehow I thought it would go well.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;What fate awaits you when you complete your training here?&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Eclé continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Out of the 100 of you, 80 will become long-term horses and die in vain. And the remaining 10, they won’t fare any better; they’ll become mere sacrifices and disappear. This is your fate. You will become toys to be played with, discarded like trash without any honor.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  People murmured but no one gave a proper answer.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;But this place is different. If you prove your worth, you will be rewarded accordingly by our Master.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Eclet closed her eyes and then opened them.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Who you were and where you came from doesn’t matter to them. Just like I, who was once an enemy of Niflheimr, am here now.&gt;

 <p>
  This woman wasn’t originally from Niflheimr.
 </p>
 <p>
  After my failure on the 80th floor and the significant loss of power, Her master was the one who had betrayed me while we were in a cooperative relationship. Of course, I utterly destroyed his waiting room.
 </p>
 <p>
  And Eclet, who was captured.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seris demanded her execution, but since we needed a power replenishment, she was spared, and we accepted her alive.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;The top 3 out of the 100 gathered here will be granted permanent residency in Niflheimr.&gt;
 </p>
 <p>
  Eclet said, her coat fluttering.
 </p>
 <p>
  &lt;Of course, all responsibilities lie with our Niflheimr.&gt;

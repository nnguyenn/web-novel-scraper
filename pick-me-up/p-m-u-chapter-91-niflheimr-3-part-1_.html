  Eclet finished her speech and descended from the podium.
 </p>
 <p>
  The instructors were still standing behind the battalion commander, and the noise from the recruits grew louder. Jenna spoke up.

  “What is she even saying? Something about nobility and whatnot.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “She means exactly what she said; Out of the 100 people here, the top 3 will be transferred to Niflheimr.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So…?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It means the waiting room you’ll be staying in will change.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The first reason Niflheimr gathers newcomers is gem allocation.
 </p>
 <p>
  If for each hero they receive 500 gems, that’s nearly 50,000 gems in total.
 </p>
 <p>
  The second reason is talent acquisition.
 </p>
 <p>
  The 100 people standing here are all promising individuals favored by their respective masters.
 </p>
 <p>
  The cost of sending them is 500 gems per person. According to their masters’ thinking, the potential of these heroes is sufficient for a paid draw of 500 gems.
 </p>
 <p>
  Niflheimr provides them with training services and offers a change of affiliation along with rewards to the top performers. Negotiations are initiated with the current master.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s about giving them some of the acquired gems.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The price varies according to my judgment.
 </p>
 <p>
  A minimum of 1,500 gems. In the case of top-notch promising individuals, it can go up to 5,000 gems.
 </p>
 <p>
  Niflheimr possesses gems in the millions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Such expenditures are not trivial. That’s what Iselle meant by calling us the tyranny of major corporations.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, most masters still apply despite knowing this.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if they are not selected, heroes who have completed their education can easily make up for the gem cost, and if they are selected, they can obtain a large number of gems for a paid draw. It was not a losing deal for them.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I wonder how Anytng will fare.”

 <p>
  Given his personality, the chances of him knowing the truth are low.
 </p>
 <p>
  If I told him to accept it, he would do it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now we begin the job classification.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After Eclet left, Eldarkin stepped onto the platform and said.
 </p>
 <p>
  Three men and women who appeared to be subordinates stood by his side, holding thick ledgers in their hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right for warrior aspirants, left for rogue aspirants. What’s the total count?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “54 warriors, 46 rogues.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A subordinate answered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eldarkin nodded and then spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Commence.”

 <p>
  The instructors behind the battalion commander stepped forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each held a red or blue flag.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Come on, as the chief instructor said, line up! Warriors go to the red, rogues to the blue!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What’s all this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna raised an eyebrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seems I’ll have to explain everything. I smirked and said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re classifying our professions. You use a bow and dagger, so you’re a rogue. Aaron and I are warriors. Once the training is over, we’ll change professions.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That means we can learn higher-level skills.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The education services of Niflheimr also included a job change process.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna’s expression darkened.

  “So I have to go over there. Is this where we part ways?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t worry. We’ll meet again soon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that really true?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Have I ever lied to you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Alright, see you later.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Jenna shook hands with Aaron and then ran to the instructor holding the blue flag.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Let’s go too. We go to the right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Okay.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The recruits split into two groups.
 </p>
 <p>
  After the classification was complete, the subordinates came out and conducted a headcount.

  “54 warriors, 46 rogues. Total of 100. No issues.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Move out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The group with the blue flag moved first.
 </p>
 <p>
  A male instructor led the prospective rogues to the three-story building on the right.
 </p>
 <p>
  Next was our group, the warrior aspirants. Eldarkin personally led us. Our destination was the five-story building in the middle.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The atmosphere here is quite unique, hyungnim.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron scratched the back of his neck.
 </p>
 <p>
  I laughed without saying a word. I agreed. It felt like we had joined the army.
 </p>
 <p>
  The recruits around us all had different expressions on their faces.
 </p>
 <p>
  We passed through the central building’s hall and arrived at a spacious auditorium.
 </p>

 <p>
  Eldarkin turned to us and spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Now, the ability test begins. Line up in front of me. Subordinates, prepare to record.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The young subordinate took out a ledger and a feather pen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Following the guidance of the other instructors, we lined up in front of Eldarkin. The moment his eyes locked with the woman at the front of the line her face hardened.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eldarkin spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We are here to assess your current abilities and skills, in order to provide appropriate training according to your aptitude. Don’t be afraid.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eldarkin scrutinized the woman in front of him from top to bottom before nodding.
 </p>
 <p>
  No sound could be heard. The subordinate standing beside him nodded and began writing something in a ledger.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘He’s looking at the stats window’
 </p>
 <p>
  Here, recruits are classified into four levels based on their stats and skills: lower, intermediate, upper, and highest.

 <p>
  The examination participants who had finished moved to the other side of the auditorium.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aaron and I were near the end of the line. I clenched my fist and recalled Niflheimr’s training process. The basic mechanics were my design. However, I didn’t know all the details. Once the system was established, I didn’t pay much attention. The second floor of Niflheimr was just a small part of the operation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Next.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It was Aaron’s turn. Aaron stood in front of Eldarkin with a tense expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eldarkin assessed Aaron and then nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Lower, I presume.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Level 20.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no progress in lower spear techniques at level 4.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eldarkin’s expression remained unchanged.
 </p>
 <p>
  The subordinate recorded Aaron’s data in the ledger.

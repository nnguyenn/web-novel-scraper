 <p>
  I raised my hand to my neck.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was stained with crimson blood.

 <p>
  “Aren’t you going to put that sword away?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet asked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Oh, no, I…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eclet hurriedly retrieved the sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  (T/N: Btw guys, forgot to put a note last time, but it’s Eclé not Eclet, however, the reason why I decided to go with Eclet is that é and et sound the same in French, and it’s easier to pronounce for those who don’t speak french.)
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master has been injured because of you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet said gently.
 </p>
 <p>
  Cold sweat trickled down Eclet’s face.
 </p>
 <p>
  I wiped a droplet of blood off my fingertip.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet touched my neck gently with her slender, long fingers. As if turning back time, the wounds and blood disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you alright?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “She looks worse than me,” I chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eclet’s body trembled like a leaf.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is our master, Lord Loki. Not only did you point your sword at him, but you also threatened to kill him depending on the situation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…I’m sorry!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eclet bowed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I… How can I… say…”
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like she wanted to make an excuse, but she couldn’t find the right words.

 <p>
  Yurnet narrowed her eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How do you plan to repay the crime of raising a sword against the master?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you command…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t be so dramatic.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I waved my hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  “She knows nothing. She made a judgment to fulfill her role. What hero could possibly think that the master would land here?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That hero is right here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re a special case. Let it go. A little spit and polish will heal the wounds, and it wasn’t so bad.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If that’s your command.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet looked down at Eclet.

  Her eyes were cold and unwavering.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re lucky. Step aside.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I… I have something to say…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Apprentice, haven’t you learned when to hold your tongue?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Eclet stood up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her expression twisted with self-loathing. There was no trace of her confident demeanor from the arena. Eclet bent at a 90-degree angle and left the hall.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked at Yurnet, who was smiling gently.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This woman…”
 </p>
 <p>
  She was quite the character.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master, this place isn’t suitable for conversation. Let’s change locations.”
 </p>

 <p>
  Yurnet paid her respects to me and flicked her fingers.
 </p>
 <p>
  A momentary mist enveloped my vision.
 </p>
 <p>
  And when the mist cleared, I found myself sitting in a secluded garden on a chair.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Teleportation, huh?’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a high-level magic, but for her, it was as easy as breathing.
 </p>
 <p>
  In front of the chair I sat on, there was an elegant table. On the table were fine tea cups and a teapot. While Yurnet politely poured tea into the cups, I looked around.
 </p>
 <p>
  Various exotic flowers were blooming in the garden.
 </p>
 <p>
  The scent, a mix of grass and flowers, tickled my nose. Looking up, I saw not a ceiling but a gray-painted sky. Finally, I understood where I was.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The top floor of Niflheimr.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The 13th floor.
 </p>

 <p>
  A place reserved for only five out of twenty thousand, along with their assistants.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Have a sip.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I raised the teacup and took a sip.
 </p>
 <p>
  The aroma lingered in my throat. I didn’t know much about tea, but I could tell it was high quality. After emptying half the cup, I spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “How did you know it was me?”
 </p>
 <p>
  In truth, it was a gamble.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet’s eyes were everywhere in Niflheimr. I knew that.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, I thought she would at least perform some minimal verification.
 </p>
 <p>
  Scratching her cheek in thought, she spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I didn’t need to ask.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “It was clear.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet chuckled lightly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The fact that Master hasn’t logged in for over three months is highly classified information known only up to the 12th floor. There were no external leaks, so if someone from another territory knows that fact…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet trailed off.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It can only be Lord Loki.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That alone is not enough.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I knew when Master disappeared, he had already fallen into Mobius.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I raised an eyebrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  This part was a bit unexpected.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet poured tea into my cup and then spoke.
 </p>

  “The connection between us and Master is deeper and stronger than you think. I’d like to explain more later if you’re okay with it. It might take a while.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Later is fine.”
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s a lot to say.
 </p>
 <p>
  Changing the order won’t make a difference.
 </p>
 <p>
  I surveyed the garden again. A girl with black maid attire and gray hair stood at the entrance of the garden. It came to me. It was Nislade, Yurnet’s personal secretary and adjutant. No other personnel were visible.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where are the other members?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nihaku and Myuden are on a mission. Ridgion and I are on standby. And Seris…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Seris isn’t here either?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, if she had been here, she would have reacted immediately upon my arrival.

 <p>
  “I’m the only one who knows that Master has come here. Except for that rude woman. Would you like to see the others? I can gather them if you command. I think everyone will be delighted.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No need for that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I shook my head.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Currently, in Niflheimr, there are Yurnet and Ridgion.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Nihaku is in charge of external affairs, so she often leaves her post, and Myuden has moved his residence outside of Niflheimr altogether. But Seris is missing.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘This is unusual.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I should ask about this later.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nislade, bring tea and snacks.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The girl approached expressionlessly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Pleased to meet you.”

 <p>
  I compared Yurnet and Eclet.
 </p>
 <p>
  In Niflheimr, their rankings were 2nd and 9th, respectively. Both of them were 6-star heroes.

 <p>
  At first glance, the gap didn’t seem significant. However, the difference in their combat abilities was beyond imagination. To put it more directly, even if all the members of the 12th floor, ranked up to 100, were to attack, they wouldn’t be able to defeat these five.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s all about the difference in the bowl,’ I muttered.
 </p>
 <p>
  (T/N: Korean expression which might mean difference in the vessel or essence.)
 </p>
 <p>
  “So even though they are both level 6, they cannot be compared,”
 </p>
 <p>
  “To put it simply. Master put in a special effort for the five of us. Thanks to that, things like this are possible.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet gestured with her hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  I widened my eyes, and a holographic graphic appeared in my field of vision.
 </p>
 <p>
  [It’s like this, Master.]
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘System.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I had seen these characters hundreds of times, but the one using the system was different.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Yurnet withdrew her hand, the message disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you know? Heroes grow closer to Master as he puts more effort and attention into them. They are directly affected by the interference power.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I recalled Iselle’s explanation of interference.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘The origin that twists the causality of this world and modifies the laws.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It accumulates automatically when the Master logs in to observe the waiting room or act.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to Iselle’s explanation, the higher the floor reached, the more efficient the accumulation seemed to be. It seems like it can also be obtained through microtransactions. In any case, this interference is used to summon heroes, compose missions, and create facilities.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So, you’re not ordinary heroes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If I had to classify it by grade, I would be around 6.5 stars. To put it broadly, we exist in Möbius, but we also have one foot in the world of Earth.”

 <p>
  A system message appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Thanks to the Master’s care.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I didn’t realize it was this amazing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Of course. The higher dimensions are enormous to us.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then how did I end up in a place like this?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet closed her eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  The smile at the corner of her mouth faded away.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I investigated that, but I couldn’t find the answer.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet told me about the situation after I disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  The five of them, who learned about my disappearance through the link, immediately began investigating the cause.

 <p>
  How and why I fell. For this, dozens of airships were secretly employed. But in the end, they couldn’t find a satisfactory answer, and Yurnet sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m sorry.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…Is that so.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But I can tell you one thing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet opened her eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “As heroes get closer to the Master, the Master also gets closer to the heroes. That must be one of the conditions for Möbius to tolerate the Master’s existence. Of course, there are other reasons.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Nisled poured tea into my cup.
 </p>
 <p>
  I continued my thoughts.
 </p>
 <p>
  The direct cause of my fall was a dungeon of super-extreme difficulty.
 </p>
 <p>
  But Yurnet didn’t mention anything about it. It was highly likely that she didn’t know. I hesitated whether to tell her or not. There were too many mysteries. But one question was answered.
 </p>

  “If what you’ve explained so far is true, then 7 stars are completely different from ordinary heroes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They are those who transcend the constraints of the system. Half-hero, half-master.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In the past, when the boundaries of the server were breached during an event.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had a direct confrontation with a 7-star. His level was 315. I managed to defeat him somehow, but it was an unbelievably high level. Because the system’s level limit was 99.
 </p>
 <p>
  I summarized Yurnet’s explanation.
 </p>
 <p>
  The grade is the hero’s vessel. As the grade goes up, heroes can get closer to the Master and the game’s system. Also, including Yurnet, the five members have already become such beings and can use the core energy of the game, interference.
 </p>
 <p>
  The higher grade than this; is the 7 star, which is a half-hero, half-master.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is…

 <p>
  ‘It seems like it’s talking about me.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I can see the manipulation window for Anytng.
 </p>
 <p>
  For other heroes, it would be impossible no matter how high their research level is.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the help of Iselle, I can also control the manipulation window.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You may already know, Master you haven’t completely lost your authority.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I guess you’re right.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If I had become a pure hero, the five of them wouldn’t have recognized me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “In my estimation, even without the Reverse Heaven’s Scriptures, the Master might be able to reach 7 stars…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Where are you going with this? I’m still a newbie.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I laughed and took a sip of the tea.
 </p>

 <p>
  I couldn’t taste it. My thoughts deepened.
 </p>
 <p>
  The reason I ended up here was the Advent Dungeon. And the guy I met during my 1-star promotion. Finally, the Reverse Heaven’s Scriptures, the key item for 7 stars. It all feels connected somehow.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…’
 </p>
 <p>
  I set the teacup down and said, “Seris didn’t go looking for me, did she?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Right after the Master disappeared, I left to find out the exact cause.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is it for the same reason that I can’t see the fairy responsible for Niflheimr?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If I tell you one thing, you’ll understand ten. That child’s role is being carried out by me.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet replied.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sub-master of Niflheimr and the affiliated fairy are not here.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike the other two members of the main party, they’re not here for dispatch or an expedition either.

 <p>
  It became clear.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Shall I try to contact them? It’s not impossible.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Don’t.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s a shame we couldn’t meet, but there was no need to force it.
 </p>
 <p>
  There would be opportunities in the future. I summarized the information I had gathered from my conversation with Yurnet. The teacup was emptied several times. After emptying the third cup, I continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Next question.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Please.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “How long can Niflheimr hold on?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet, who had been listening attentively, laughed.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you worried about the account deletion?”
 </p>

  “If six months pass in Earth time, the account could be deleted. That’s what the rules say.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After coming all this way, it would be troublesome if the account disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had no intention of giving up Pick Me Up until I cleared the 100th floor of Niflheimr. My purpose for playing was more than just enjoyment.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet said, “Don’t worry. Niflheimr is brimming with interference more than any other realm. It doesn’t necessarily mean it will be deleted after six months. With enough interference, it should last for ten years at least.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Well, that’s a relief.”
 </p>
 <p>
  There was plenty of time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ten years would be enough time to make preparations.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I’ve asked almost everything.’
 </p>
 <p>
  The core questions were answered.
 </p>
 <p>
  What happened after I disappeared. The reason the five of them were able to find me. Independent operating time.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were many other things I was curious about, but just organizing the current information felt overwhelming. Accepting too much information at once could lead to confusion.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Have your questions been answered?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “To some extent.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “May I speak now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed they had a lot to say too. I nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can guess what they want to say.’

  “Have your questions been answered?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “To some extent.”

 <p>
  “May I speak now?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I smiled.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed they had a lot to say too. I nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I can guess what they want to say.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet stood up from her chair.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nisled quickly cleared away the snacks and tea on the table. It seemed like they were about to change locations.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, as I stood up, the location changed in an instant.
 </p>
 <p>
  A chandelier hung from the high ceiling,
 </p>
 <p>
  A red carpet was laid on the floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a place I had never seen before.
 </p>
 <p>
  It must be the place Yurnet had prepared for me.
 </p>
 <p>
  The carpet extended forward as I followed it with my gaze. On either side were giant pillars, and the walls were adorned with sculptures. I examined the sculptures.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Wow.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t help but laugh.
 </p>
 <p>
  It depicted a fierce battle on the 80th floor, the most intense battle during Niflheimr missions.
 </p>
 <p>
  I looked ahead.
 </p>
 <p>
  A curtain of darkness concealed the front.
 </p>
 <p>
  I laughed and said, “Is there a throne behind that curtain?”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Yes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet replied without hesitation.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is a place I, no, we prepared for the Master.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “A castle, huh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I laughed bitterly.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had known it would come to this.
 </p>
 <p>
  Parararak.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shelves near Yurnet fluttered.
 </p>
 <p>
  The white shelves wrapped around Yurnet’s body and transformed into clothes. On the left chest was the emblem of Niflheimr’s Conqueror, engraved in gold.
 </p>
 <p>
  “While I’m saddened by the fact that the Master has come here, I’m also pleased. Because now I can meet you in person.”

 <p>
  Yurnet continued speaking.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I believe it’s time for the Master to take a rightful seat.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet looked at the curtain that covered the center of the hall.
 </p>
 <p>
  The black curtain turned gray, and the shadow of a throne appeared behind the curtain.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master, please stay in Niflheimr.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet knelt on one knee before me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Although you’ve become a hero, you’re not an ordinary existence, Master. With my assistance, you can fulfill your role adequately.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [I will transfer all my authority.]
 </p>
 <p>
  A system message appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You don’t have to worry about Townia. If we, Niflheimr, support it as an ally, it can still grow even without you, Master.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  [We need you, Master. Please.]
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet lowered her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the same time, the system was updated.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Yurnet (★★★★★★)’ is transferring the sub-master rights of ‘Niflheimr’.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Accept?]
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes / No]
 </p>
 <p>
  I raised my hand to the message window.
 </p>
 <p>
  A ripple spread where my hand touched.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m not the Master anymore.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Don’t worry. We will support you wholeheartedly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I stared at the message in front of me.
 </p>
 <p>
  If I press ‘Yes,’ my affiliation will automatically change to Niflheimr. Moreover, in the absence of the Master, I could become the practical administrator of Niflheimr.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anytng would receive a reward worth tens of thousands of gems.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s not all. After applying for an alliance, I could provide various forms of support. Even without me, Townia could continue to operate smoothly.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is that so?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Yes / No (Selection)]
 </p>
 <p>
  The acceptance window disappeared.

  “…Master.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet looked at me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her pupils were trembling.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Am I not enough on my own? If not, then the other four…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No need to call them. It would be the same.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If we’re lacking…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet prostrated himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If we are deficient in any way!”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m the one who’s lacking.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I shook my head.

 <p>
  “I’m still weak.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you give me a little more time, we can…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m going back to Townia.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet’s body trembled.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why are you being so stubborn? I just don’t want to take the bus.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Huh?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Just get up for now. It’s not pleasant to look at.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet didn’t get up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you don’t get up, I won’t speak.”
 </p>
 <div class="code-block code-block-12" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

 </div>
 <p>
  Yurnet reluctantly stood up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Tears welled up in the corners of her eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not because I don’t like you or dislike this place.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If I stay in Niflheimr, I can start over in an environment that’s hundreds of times superior to Townia.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m not ready.”
 </p>
 <p>
  First of all,
 </p>
 <p>
  Niflheimr is undoubtedly powerful.
 </p>
 <p>
  But relying solely on it will corrupt me.
 </p>
 <p>
  The goal of climbing the Tower is temporary.
 </p>
 <p>
  I don’t believe 100% that I can return when I reach the 100th floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the end, I might end up returning with my own strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  Secondly,
 </p>
 <p>
  I haven’t prepared to take responsibility for them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Accepting is easy.
 </p>
 <p>
  But taking responsibility is a different matter. It didn’t matter when I was the Master, but now that I know their true identity and have become the same kind of being, it’s a significant change.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lastly…
 </p>
 <p>
  I chuckled. This was a somewhat trivial reason.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s hard to say that I can’t stay because I made a promise.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you need an explanation?”
 </p>

  Yurnet lowered her eyes.

 <p>
  “I understand.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you understand, that’s enough.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “But I haven’t given up.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hmm?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Yurnet pursed her lips.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Do you want to return to Earth?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s one way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In any case, I don’t plan to stay here.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mobius is not my hometown.

  Although there are no waiting family members, Earth is where I was born.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you can’t go back, what will you do?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…It’s a complicated issue.”
 </p>
 <p>
  If I couldn’t go back. After reaching the 100th floor of the Tower. After defeating that guy. Even searching through different dimensions didn’t reveal a way. If that happens…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Well, there’s nothing I can do.’
 </p>
 <p>
  If I can’t go back to Earth, even after resolving Townia’s problem,
 </p>
 <p>
  then,
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll do as you wish.”

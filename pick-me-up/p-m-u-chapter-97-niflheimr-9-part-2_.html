 <p>
  I don’t know how many hours I swung my sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  I felt my body getting as heavy as wet cotton. It was a feeling I hadn’t experienced much since my stamina exceeded 40. Thanks to the healing power, it was only to this extent. If it had been in a mission, I would have collapsed from exhaustion.

 <p>
  ‘This guy is a real monster.’
 </p>
 <p>
  We had practiced for at least three hours.
 </p>
 <p>
  But Ridgion’s posture remained unchanged. Even though I had known it when he was a master, feeling it firsthand was sickening.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Indeed.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t an exaggeration.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the three heroes who fought Seris, Ridgion was the only one with a chance of winning.
 </p>
 <p>
  A specialist in small-scale and large-scale battles.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridgion boasted an almost unbeatable advantage when facing human-type opponents.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is it absurd to assess it like this when he hasn’t even shown me his true strength?’
 </p>
 <p>
  I let out a bitter laugh and sat down in the chair. When I looked to the side, I saw a wooden doll for practice. I don’t know when it appeared, but it seems something Nisled would prepare. She probably finished setting up and had disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you satisfied?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridgion said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I knew full well that I wasn’t good enough.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Even if you search through all of Mobius, you can count on one hand the number of 3-star heroes of the same level that can compete with the Master.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s no need for pointless exaggeration. I want to hear your real opinion.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridgion said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If the time is one month… it will be difficult to make real progress.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “So?”
 </p>

 <p>
  “To prepare for what comes after you return, you should perfect the basics.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridgion said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Currently, Master’s greatest strength is the ability to use Frenzy without losing control. The reason this is possible is probably…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Because I’m half-hero, half-master.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes. Master’s current state is similar to 7-Heroes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridgion nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  I recalled my skill status.
 </p>
 <p>
  Composure and Frenzy. Skills that a single hero couldn’t learn at the same time naturally complemented each other. It was clearly a bug character. It had exceeded the system’s restrictions.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘It’s hard to say that I’m different from those guys.’
 </p>
 <p>
  All 7-Star heroes exceed level 100.

 <p>
  Their skills should be in a similar state to mine. Skills that couldn’t be combined are now merging, and skills that couldn’t be separated are splitting apart. Limited imprint slots seem to be unlimited.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘That’s ridiculous.’
 </p>
 <p>
  It was truly a balance collapse.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Based on our investigation here, there’s one more characteristic of the 7-Star Heroes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “What is it?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The synthetic efficiency is significant.,” Ridgion said. “When a hero receives the data of a sacrifice, over 90% of the information is lost during the transfer process. Even if a hero with a power of 100 is used as a sacrifice, the target hero can only become as strong as 10.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Of course, 10 is a high estimate. On average, the data loss rate for synthetic is over 95%.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The 7-Star… is different.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridgion put his fist on his chin and fell into thought for a few seconds before saying, “In Master’s swordsmanship… there are traces of formal training.”
 </p>

 <p>
  “Hmm?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Fundamentally, it feels rough and barbaric, honed in practical combat, but in some movements, occasionally, those aspects can be seen.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridgion opened his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master, who was from Earth, hadn’t received swordsmanship training.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “In that case…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, it’s mixed into Master’s swordsmanship. The knights’ characteristics.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I closed my eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
  The image of someone came to mind. A female knight who used precise and deadly swordsmanship to defeat enemies.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Shey Radastery.’
 </p>
 <p>
  (T/N: The female 4-Star Hero in the first few chapters.)

 <p>
  She, who was several times stronger than me at that time, had been synthesized into me due to Master’s simple mistake.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is that so?”
 </p>
 <p>
  I muttered.
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t know when I was a 1-Star Hero. But after reaching 2-Star class, sometimes when I swung my sword, I felt a strange sensation, as if there was something else in my movements.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Indeed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridgion nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  He seemed to have guessed that a high-class hero had been synthesized into me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is all my talent because of that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “No, it’s not. If that were the case, Master’s swordsmanship would be completely different now. It does have an influence, but it’s not that significant. However…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridgion chuckled lightly.
 </p>

 <p>
  “If you can consciously utilize it, it will be a great help to Master.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridgion drew his sword from the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t know to whom it belonged, but when I saw it, it seemed to have reached the intermediate level.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It was an intermediate swordsmanship.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Her precise thrusts were outstanding.
 </p>
 <p>
  I still remember how she pierced the goblin’s jugular vein as if measuring it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Can you try using that person’s swordsmanship?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ll try.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I got up from my seat.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed that Shey’s skills had indeed inadvertently helped my growth. I had sometimes felt a strange sensation when I swung my sword.

 <p>
  ‘If it’s true that I’m influenced by that woman.’
 </p>
 <p>
  There would be both advantages and disadvantages.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, as Ridgion had said, depending on how it was used, it had the potential to be very powerful.
 </p>
 <p>
  I raised the sword and focused my breath.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridgion’s posture remained the same as before. He held his sword still and watched me.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Consciously.’
 </p>
 <p>
  I recalled the memory.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was fleeting, but there was something I could feel.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Didn’t she say something?’
 </p>
 <p>
  What Shey had said just before disappearing.
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  At that time, I couldn’t understand its meaning.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m coming.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I pivoted my foot.
 </p>
 <p>
  My body shot out like an arrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Come.’
 </p>
 <p>
  A surge of energy erupted around my heart and spread throughout my body.
 </p>
 <p>
  I consciously grasped it. Made it mine.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘…’
 </p>
 <p>
  My body moved naturally.
 </p>
 <p>
  [Skill Awakening!]
 </p>
 <p>
  [‘Han (★★★)’s ‘Low-level Swordsmanship’ has reached Lv.9!]
 </p>
 <p>
  Swoosh!
 </p>
 <p>
  A perfect thrust surged forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  A smile formed at the corner of Ridgion’s mouth.

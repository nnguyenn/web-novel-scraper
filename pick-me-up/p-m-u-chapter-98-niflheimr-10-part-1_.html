 <p>
  In the end, the thrusting skill failed to land on Ridgion.
 </p>
 <p>
  He changed his stance and smoothly parried it. I looked at my trembling right hand lightly. The movement I had just made was sharper and more intricate than anything I had ever done before.

 <p>
  “It’s much better than last time.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridgion lowered his sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridgion’s feet, which had not moved at all since we started practicing, took a step back.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is the efficiency of synthesis different?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “To the Master, synthesis is not just about absorbing experience points.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridgion lowered his voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But be cautious. Higher efficiency isn’t always better. There’s a risk that the information between the Master and the target may become mixed, or it could have a negative impact.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  I gained some adjustments in swordsmanship through synthesis with Shay. It had certainly been a boost to my growth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Low-level heroes with no remarkable abilities might benefit from it, but if a higher-ranked hero was synthesized, they could gain similar experiences.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, it wasn’t entirely without drawbacks.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If you overdo synthesis…”
 </p>
 <p>
  Information gets mixed up.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s a reason why Master who uses swordsmanship can’t learn defensive skills. There may not be much difference in the direction of talents, but…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “We should be careful.”
 </p>
 <p>
  There are no advanced heroes in Townia with a rank of 4 or higher yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, as the waiting room expands and the number of floors increases, there will undoubtedly be a few heroes who will be synthesized into me in the meantime.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘But I don’t decide.’

 <p>
  The Master of Townia is not me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if I become a sub-master, I won’t be allowed the authority to synthesize.
 </p>
 <p>
  But I could still have an indirect influence. I needed to consider this aspect.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I raised one level in just one day. I thought it would take ten days.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master’s talent…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Stop praising me. It’s embarrassing. Anyway, if progress is faster than I expected, one intermediate martial skill won’t be enough.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “In that case…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I want to learn ‘Heavenly Sword Spirit.'”
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Heavenly Sword Spirit is not a commonly classified skill.
 </p>
 <p>
  As far as I know, Ridgion is the only hero who possesses ‘Heavenly Sword Spirit.’

 <p>
  ‘Heavenly Sword Spirit’ is a unique skill with only one possessor.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Gladly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridgion bowed his head to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But before that, you must break through intermediate martial skills.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Is there a restriction on that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not really, but at this stage, it will be less efficient to learn. And I apologize, but even if I do my best, the Master may not be able to learn it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That doesn’t matter. I won’t blame you for my lack of skill.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridgion is giving it his all.
 </p>
 <p>
  If I can’t learn it, it’s my deficiency.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I should change my schedule a bit.’

 <p>
  It seems that I’m gaining more than I thought from this.
 </p>
 <p>
  I needed to invest a little more time.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘I must exclude stamina training.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Stamina training is a training that can be done even after returning.
 </p>
 <p>
  But sparring and training with Ridgion are invaluable experiences that cannot be obtained anywhere else. I should ask Yurnet to set up an evening session as well. Leaving it alone for too long might get me caught, but I had already figured that out when I brought him here.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Then, the next practice…”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Master.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A familiar voice was heard.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking to the side, I noticed Nisled, who was pulling a multi-layered cart. On the cart, there were various dishes placed on high-quality plates.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s mealtime. You can take a break while eating.”
 </p>

 </div>
 <p>
  Nisled fluttered her apron and a small wooden table appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nisled set up the chairs, laid out various dishes on the table, and then bowed before disappearing. She was still the same busybody. I put my sword in its sheath.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I guess we should eat first.”
 </p>
 <p>
  After finishing the meal, I took a short break.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then I faced Ridgion again. I tried to recreate the feeling I had when I raised my weapon skill level by one.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s not going well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It felt like beginner’s luck, and the sensation was faint like it was coming and going.
 </p>
 <p>
  But it didn’t completely disappear. It lingered faintly in my hand. I looked at Ridgion. The posture remained the same, no greetings were needed. I raised my sword and rushed in.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clang!
 </p>
 <p>
  The swords collided and produced a loud noise.
 </p>

 <p>
  Every time I cut and thrust, Ridgion smoothly redirected his sword, deflecting and blocking effortlessly. Even after hours of observation, his movements remained mysterious.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your techniques have improved,” Ridgion said, effortlessly parrying my diagonal slash.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s because I didn’t use Frenzy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  For the afternoon sparring session, we decided to fight in a different way.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the morning session focused on strength and speed, this time we planned to test a more technique-oriented approach, even if it meant being a bit weaker and slower.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The unnatural movements that occasionally appear in the Master’s swordsmanship seem to be because of that skill,” Ridgion commented.
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s not the only thing,” I replied, swinging my shield.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sword drew a half-circle as it brushed against the shield.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ridgion paused for a moment and then continued, “When you reach level 10, you should consider separating your skills.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was already thinking about that.”
 </p>

 <p>
  To change skills, you needed a special item called the “Awakening Elixir.” It required various rare materials and advanced alchemy, but here, it was as common as pebbles. Bringing a few wouldn’t even raise suspicions.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was plenty to do.
 </p>
 <p>
  Broadly speaking, adjusting and learning swordsmanship was the priority. I had to achieve this even if it meant giving up other things.
 </p>
 <p>
  Secondly, I needed to change my type of swordsmanship.
 </p>
 <p>
  The shield was undoubtedly useful equipment. I have overcome numerous crises thanks to it. However, it didn’t suit my aptitude. Just by looking at my inability to learn defensive skills, it was clear. To advance to higher-tier swordsmanship, I needed to change from shield-swordsmanship to regular swordsmanship.
 </p>
 <p>
  The third goal was to acquire the “Heavenly Sword Spirit.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The principle might be complex, but the effect was simple: it amplified the power and speed applied to the weapon. If properly harmonized, it would give wings to my Frenzy. It was equivalent to receiving two adjustments to my stats.
 </p>
 <p>
  The fourth was to adjust Frenzy.
 </p>
 <p>
  As I had felt and Ridgion mentioned, activating Frenzy seemed to incur a penalty in swordsmanship. If I could somehow offset this penalty…
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Is it too much to go this far?’
 </p>

 <p>
  Time is tight to accomplish even just one.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if I get it right to the third one, I will become incomparably stronger. Thus, I decided to keep the fourth goal in mind but not overdo it.
